 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen		10
 A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all-time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it.It's pacing is deliberate as well. As we spend the film watching the same actors, it is easy to forget that the movie's timeline spans well over 20 years. Such a huge measure of time would pass slowly in reality, and would only be amplified in prison. And it's not as if the film lacks interest in these moments. It still knows where it's going, it merely intends on taking its sweet time getting there. It pays off as well, as the tedium of prison life makes the climax that much more exhilarating. For anyone who sees it, it is a moment never to be forgotten.With themes of faith and hope, there is a definite religious subtext to be found here. Quiet, selfless and carefree, Andy is an obvious Christ figure. Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is obviously modeled on Richard Nixon, who, in his day, was as close to a personified Satan as they come. But if you aren't looking for subtexts, the movie speaks to anyone in search of hope. It is a compelling drama, and a very moving film, perfectly written, acted and shot. They just don't come much better than this.OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""	10
 Don't Rent Shawshank.		10
 My favorite movie of all time.	The Shawshank Redemption has great performances, extremely well written script and story all leading to a deeply emotional climax! One of the best dramas of all time!	10
 Prepare to be moved	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams.  And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.  Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message.  Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him.  Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie.  You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.

 Shawshank Redeems Hollywood		10
 Eternal Hope		10
 Stephen King's best adapted movie		10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	10
 Two movies in one	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally  found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There  is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element  comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema.   I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that  people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of  Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances.   However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find  meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.  Who is your Andy Dufresne?	
" Simply known as ""The Movie"""		10
 The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.	"My life is forever changed due to this movie.  It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship.  It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red.  They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison.  As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy.  His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel.  Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light.  For some of those people time will tell.  As for now I'll be patient to wait and see.  Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out.  There is someone out there that cares for you.  Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."	10
 Simply amazing. The best film of the 90's.	"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	10
 Oh my godmother		10
 its an excellent piece of art	i watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.	10
 Prison thriller with violence, hatred, corruption, friendship and joy.		10
 The best story ever told on film	"I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or cliched, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."	8
 This is a wonderful movie!!!!	"When I first see it, I am too young to understand all the things the movie what to show us. The film gave me a very different feeling. Hope is a dangerous thing, is the root of mental distress. Because since come in the day, the warden said, ""the soul to god, the body to me.""Except that he can get the cigarettes and naked woman printed CARDS and any other changes I can't seem to grow within the walls of the dark. However Andy told him, ""remember, hope is a good thing - and perhaps even good. And no good thing will never disappear."" So Andy can use 20 years digging Red think can chisel in tunnel in six hundred.When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of the stench of sewage pipes, standing in the pouring rain can't help, we seem to see faith Pierce heavy darkness, played a luminous in the dark of the night out of the blue.Under the light, the soul of our weak under Andy with open arms in the sky in succession, and shaking."	10
 Hope can set you free and so can this remarkable film		10
 From my favorite movies..	It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.	10
 A movie revolution upon all others	We have all see movies, comedies, action and dramas. We all liked ones, hated others, got into some other even and felt like part of it. In Shawshank Redemption; you start slowly, after a while you get attached, by the time you reach the middle of the movie you simply totally forget about anything outside the screen and feel a mixed stream of emotions going through you head before anything else! then comes a last 20 minutes of heart storming that is surely enough to raise the adrenaline to extreme levels even in diabetics! I felt warm, strong, happy and all other emotions one can think of, I felt I was the one who won, who got out of prison, i was simply fully satisfied.This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!	10
 Busy dying or busy living?	**Yes, there are SPOILERS here**This film has had such an emotional impact on me, I find it hard to write comments on it.  I've read a lot of the previous comments; all those that gush and eulogise as well as those who think it's over-rated or cliched. Most have got good points to make, however the thing that I think everyone is struggling to both explain and come to terms with is just why this film is *so* loved.  Loved to the extent that for many it is an almost spiritual experience or for those of a more secular nature like myself, loved as one of the most devastatingly uplifting things that can happen to you while watching a film.So I'm not going to review it, I'm just going to struggle in my own way to explain this film.  It took me a few viewings to get why I connect with it so deeply, but here goes.Many people in this world are unhappy.  Most people in this world don't want to be unhappy.  Lots of people wish, pray and above all hope for that magic wand to wave and wash them of their fears, losses, angers and pains once and for all.  They see lots of other people seemingly in this magical state, while they suffer.  To borrow the words of another film, they're watching the bluebirds flying over the rainbow.Many unhappy people have learned that the magic wand doesn't exist. They're not destined to join the bluebirds and fairytales don't come true.  It's not that no one lives happily ever after, it's just that they're not going to. They're busy dying.In this film, or as some people have quite correctly said, this fairytale, magic wands exist.  And that magic wand is Andy Dufrense imitating Houdini. However this film is not about him.  Neither is it about the prison, the governor, the guard, the plot, the acting, the cinematography, the script, the direction or the score.It's about Red.  He is the one who has become institutionally unhappy, he's not only trapped in a prison, not only has he given up on the idea of ever leaving, not only does he have no hope, he knows that if the miracle would ever happen to him, he couldn't cope.  He's safe in his unhappiness and that security is what keeps him going.  Hope is, as Red say, dangerous.  The metaphor for a certain illness here is very clear to me and I know that a rather large number of people suffer from it.  A large proportion of those don't understand what's wrong, but they certainly can recognise a fellow sufferer.  Those who are mercifully untouched by this illness definitely don't understand what's going on in those who do.  They're too busy living.The miracle in this film is not only that Red is redeemed but that the world outside the prison isn't all warm and sandy and sunny and with excellent fishing.  Some of it is rocky and uncertain.  Fairytales don't get this far. They'd end as Red left the gates of the prison and the credits would say 'and he lived happily ever after'.  This is the only film I can currently think of where they show how to get to the living happily ever after bit from your redemption via the rocky and uncertain ground of bagging groceries at the local store.  In other words, they're not going to cheat you and tell you everything's going to be alright.This is crucial.  For two and half hours, those of us who are quite content to mooch around our own personal prisons can see an escape route quite different to Andy's mapped out on the screen.  And it's a real way out. It's hard and upsetting, but ultimately rewarding.  The high you get from finding out and knowing that is only comparable diamorphine.The trouble is, if you're already busy living, this film won't mean that much and you'll see it a little more clearly than those busy dying.  To those fortunate individuals, watch this film and understand what the rest of us are going through.So, yes, this film is a cliched fairytale and maybe as a story it isn't realistic and at second on the IMDb all time list, it is a bit over-rated. However if you could have a chart of films listing the number of lives saved, altered and improved, the Shawshank Redemption would be way out in front at number one.	10
 Greatest movie of all time!	This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!	10
 A Must watch Awesome Movie		10
 I make the questions here!	"It has a formula that gives you this kick; Darn what a good movie! But I need to say this, sometimes it happens.. So WHY do people love this movie and rate it high, when, or WHY isn't the ""smart"" people declare it like a a peace of art? Or do they?! Still I think it's darn good...but I bet the producer(s) didn't expect that!Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway. And I do, yes I do!"	10
 Freeman gives it depth		8
 The Greatest Movie of all Time		10
 Great story, wondrously told and acted	"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"	8
 The closest thing to poetic perfection Hollywood has ever produced		10
 An extraordinary and unforgettable film about a bank veep who is convicted of murders and sentenced to the toughest prison		9
 life changing	I first saw this film, like many others, by chance and on DVD. And like others, I have since watched it over and over again. When I feel sad, it makes me feel happy, when I need hope, it gives me hope.When I want to reaffirm my very belief in life, and all it can offer, this film gives me a new sense of purpose that no other film has ever come close to doing.It soars above anything any other movie has tried to achieve in the way it touches on the true virtues of life itself. The portrayal of friendship, the devastation of loss and the maintaining of hope. Outstanding performances from the two leads and the most beautiful of narratives are the tip of the iceberg of why this film is so great. The cinematography from the very first shots of the prison are stunning and the accompanying soundtrack add to the haunting atmosphere when we first venture inside the prison walls. Thank you Mr Darabont, Mr Robins and Mr Freeman. Thank you to every one else involved. You changed my life	10
 A Truly Uplifting Film	Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. It is the only movie I've seen that has made tears of happiness come to my eyes. I would (and do) recommend this film to anyone and everyone.	10
 Masterpiece		
 Stands the test of time	This film will go down in history as one of the greats!!!	9
 Dragged to the theater to watch it, dragged out of the theater when it was over	Like a lot of people, didn't really seem an interesting title when it was released. WHOA. This is a movie that I know I've watched the most number of times than any other movie. Fantastic movie.	10
 Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time		10
 Enthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!		10
 The shortest long movie I've ever seen. Kept me wanting more and more, minute by minute.		10
 A melodramatic, motherf***ing masterpiece		10
 When There is Life, There is Hope; When There is Hope, There is Life		10
 Good , But It Is Overrated By Some	In recent years the IMDB top 250 movies has had THE GODFATHER at number 1 while THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION has remained at number 2 . The only exception was early in 2002 when FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING topped the chart for a couple of months then dropped down to number 2 for a couple of more months . I`ll probably make myself very unpopular for saying this but I don`t think SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION deserves to be so high !!!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!!What I don`t like about it is the amount of cliches . New prisoner arrives and finds a maggot in his food , prison cliche 37 . New prisoner gives maggot to old prisoner to feed his pet bird , prison cliche 43 . It`s revealed at the end that the prisoner who has spent so many years inside is innocent after all , prison cliche numero uno . Did anyone believe during any part of this movie that Andy Dufresne was guilty ? Neither did I . Maybe that`s why I love the American prison series OZ because all the inmates there are totally guilty . There`s other things wrong with the movie . It`s about half an hour overlong , and there`s rather unrealistic bits like the warder having someone killed after finding out Dufresne is probably innocent. Oh and how many prison friendships has there been between a black man and a white man ? Maybe that last point shouldn`t be taken as a criticism because the performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are very good and make the movie . Neither of them give a flashy performance ( Again not a criticism ) but both are very subtle in their roles , can you imagine how different this movie would have been if we`d had Tom Cruise and Denzil Washington as the stars ? Perhaps because Freeman`s character of Red does seem to have been written as a white character he`s so good in the role . Am I alone in thinking Freeman has been the best black actor in Hollywood for the last decade because he`s more interested in exploring the character instead of playing someone who`s black ? There`s also some outstanding touches from director Frank Darabont . Witness the scene early in the film where Andy spends his first night in prison with the darkness falling upon the prisoners faces . It`s almost like the artwork of Andy Dogg as the prisoners look out onto the landing as they search for fresh prey , and there is quite a touching sequence as Red leaves prison out into the harsh outside world to the strains of Thomas Newman`s scoreI gave THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION eight out of ten . It is a classic feel good movie but unfortunately being a cynic I do think it`s slightly overrated by IMDB voters	8
 Relentless Storytelling		
 In my opinion the best movie ever made.	This movie is intelligent, based on an excellent book played by legendary actor as Morgan Freeman. Directed by a true artist ( Frank Darabont), I hope that this movie will be remembered for many and many years, Probably the best Picture ever made in the all history. You need to see at least one time in your life.	10
 Wonderfull	I'm watched before at long time. I like it. This is amazing.	10
 For the first time the Movie defeats the Book!		10
 One of the best movies ever made?	"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in EUrope, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge..."	10
 Best movie of all time!	"The first time I ever saw this movie I was just floored at how incredible it was. What wonderful casting that was done to help this amazing story be told. Stephen King has a way about creating such memorable characters. For those of you who think this movie is a ""prison movie"" you are sadly mistaken. This movie merely takes place in a prison but this story is about so much more...friendship, hope, survival and dreams! There is a reason this movie is voted #1 on the IMDb site! Not only have I enjoyed watching this movie over a hundred times but I have been lucky enough to have been in that prison numerous times doing paranormal events. My last visit out there was last weekend and I decided to also go and visit all of the filming locations! That was a real treat! All I can say is that if you have not seen this film just take the time to watch it and just take in the amazing story and the incredible performances turned in by the cast! I promise you that you won't be sorry!!!"	10
 My own personal view		10
 Better Late Then Never		10
 Good movie, but best of all time? Hardly . . .		7
 This is one of the most inspiring n one of the greatest film.	The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest film. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time. I feel so bad about not writing a review of this masterpiece during the late nineties.	10
 The greatest movie ever made..!	The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something.	10
 NOT just a prison movie	A film about a Stephen King story? Directed by Frank Darabont.  .  .  Who?  Starring Tim Robbins.  .  .  Wasn't he the guy from Howard the Duck?  I admit, only the sublime acting talents of Morgan Freeman took me along to see this movie.  Now the only questions I have to ask are:  Why didn't EVERYBODY go to see this movie?  and, Why didn't Morgan Freeman win the Oscar?  Tom Hanks is a fine actor but, he should never have beaten Morgan.  Once again a Stephen King short story translates to film better than his horror opus'.  Tim Robbins pulls out his finest performance to date, and, Mr Darabont take a bow.  Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach.  .  .  Perfect.	10
 Mystery	I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.	7
 A movie about an innocent clever man who learns to live within prison walls.	This is Tim Robbins best performance ever. It is a compelling heart warming drama about an innocent man(Andy Dufresbe) who is sent to prison and learns to use his intelligence to make the best of prison life. He meets a mentor in Red(Morgan Freeman) and they build a friendship that is stronger than the walls that surround them. Andy steadies a relationship with the warden that keeps him in the good eyes of the prison. Andy is full of surprises and uses his resourcefulness to not only win the friendships of his fellow prisoners, but also of the prison guards. Both Andy and Red both hold on to their dream of one day enjoying their freedom. They turn their friendship and dreams of freedom into a bond that no prison could ever take away.	
 What a touching movie !		10
 Hope......Don't loose it at any cost		10
 An amazing tale of hope and patience	When i rented the movie, i was doubtful, whether to rent it or not. Then i started watching it. From the very 1st moment i was kinda sure, it wud be worthy watching this; and worthy it was. The fascinating performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, the direction, and everything puts you in the place of the actors, making you feel the way they felt. This movie doesn't have any dirty romance or impossible actions, rather, it focuses on a greater philosophy - Hope to live when there is no hope, survival -- This is one movie, that will leave you talking about it even many days after watching. I won't say anymore, the rest is up-to you to find out when you see the movie	10
 The greatest movie ever made and to be made		10
 Really good adapted screenplay but that's not enough to being the top rated movie of all time.		9
 prison escape	This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you...	10
 Awesome movie - The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	"It's very rare that you find such diversity in a movie now days. I like the story and it's concept.A thumping good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twister of twists since ""The Crying Game."" The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful and uplifting, not to mention Oscar-worthy film. In 2006, it was ranked as the greatest film ever by Empire, a film magazine. The year it came out it was nominated for 7 academy awards but did not win a single one because of a movie you may all remember, Forrest Gump. It's the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil."	10
 An astonishing tale of endurance, courage, life, and perspective..	At the time of writing this comment, IMDb ranks the Shawshank Redemption as No. 2 in top 250 best movies of all time. Let me tell you that this is no exaggeration and no small feat given IMDb's strict rating criteria. Shawshank is indeed, up there amongst the best, and if you haven't seen it yet, you should make it a point to watch it, at least once sometime in your life. For it is an astonishing tale, of endurance, courage, life, and perspective, combined with a stunning score that flows so closely with the highs and lows of emotion that it could make grown men cry. No words can explain how good Shawshank really is, but let the sheer volume of good user reviews made by devotees in this website be proof enough of its greatness.	10
 really superb	"i watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."	10
 This Movie Saved My Life.	I have been a fan of this movie for a long time.It seems that ever time my life hits a downward spiral, I can always seem to pop this movie in, and come up with a solution to my pending problem. It somehow gives Me sense of peace and inner strength.So, It wasn't all that strange for me to pop it in when I was going through a rough patch in my marriage. I found myself identifying with many of the characters in this movie.Many of them are trapped in a world of regret and mourning, due to a mistake that had been made early on in their lives. This film gave me the strength to escape from my world of misery. And now I am able to say I, Like Andy broke out of my own personal Shawshank.My Ex isn't too happy about the divorce. But life is much better now. And I feel saved from a life of unhappiness, Due to a mistake of a marriage to early in life.Thank You Frank Durabont.Your film saved my life.	9
" The UNIVERSALITY of Shawshank:. Andy Dufresne as ""EVERYMAN"""		10
 I didn't think films could be this good....		10
 Simply Perfect	Like I did a few years back, you might be hesitating about watching this film. The title didn't appeal to me, and neither did the subject matter, so it was only by chance that I started to watch it.I can only say that the film was a revelation for me and has stayed with me ever since. There are so many dark and hopeless films out there which, whilst they leave an impression, leave the wrong one i.e that there is no hope in life. Watch this film and be uplifted and be encouraged by the message...that there is ALWAYS hope....in any situation.Please watch this film and the watch it again. It's a great answer to all the cynicism that is out there.	10
 One of the best movies I have ever seen	This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. I first read the book, and I didn't liked it that much, but then I saw the movie. And that's a things that's never happened to me before, the movie was better than the book. It's the other way normally. But in this case, the movie is so much better, I like the end more than in the book. Watch the movie, it is great.	10
 Well Worth A Read.	"I enjoyed reading Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth And Shawshank Redemption"" from the book ""Different Seasons"" more than watching the movie. However, it's still one of my favourite movies of all time.It has very few peers, and has to be seen. It is Awesome."	10
 The writing was there	I really loved this movie I watch 2 time actually but it was too long	8
 Masterpiece	One of the epic and remembered movie of all the time.it's an one of the best movie ever watched.	10
 WYLION - Do you trust your wife? You can definitely trust me!	The question you have to ask is, wasn't this the most well made movie to date? I think so, but what makes this movie so special?To make a movie special you really need to look at it in a different way. Where other phenomenal movies have many of the same characteristics as this one, The Shawshank Redemption has that little bit extra. Yes the performances are brilliant and yes the pace of the movie is well thought out but there are many other movies that are great for the same reasons as that.What is different about this movie is that the creators were not afraid to go outside the lines. I mean look at most movies, they usually go from OK to good, to bad and then back to good again. On top of that nothing really deviates from the main story line nowhere-days as to keep the run time as low as possible. If The Shawshank Redemption was made in 2019 it would be significantly shorter and this is all down to production company want to keep the run time as low as possible. Now I am not say this masterpiece is long because it isn't. It only sits at 142 minutes but there are scenes that might be see as unnecessary by the untrained eye. Let's look at the massive deviation of the movie, the release of Brooks Hatlen. Now this scene is extremely important for the entire movie. It truly shows how a person can fall into that routine and become institutionalized. It gives us an idea on real life and opens our eyes to something as sad as this.The Shawshank Redemption is up and down throughout with just fantastic character development. It puts you in the movie and you can really feel how the characters are feeling and how awful the prison environment is or was in real life. It didn't follow any stereotypes it just educated us on what is really going on in the world. It sticks to the theme of real life by having two of the non-criminals being the antagonists throughout. It shows us how people in the real world abuse the power they have over one an other. We live in a cruel world and Frank Darabont hit the nail on the head with this timeless movie classic.	10
 Loved it!	I loved this movie! It was smart, clever, and brings you inside behind the wall. The actors are brilliant, the writing was awesome! I highly recommend you see this movie!	10
 It was best in my life	So i watched this film maybe 10 times Russian version, 5 original English. Read both book versions. It's beautiful story! When i have watched this film first time, after started to follow the career of the actor Morgan Freeman. He is a great actor. I give the film 10 stars	10
 Fantastic movie		10
 Shawshank Redemption- Prison Film is Redeemed by Quality ****	"An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman etched unforgettable performances as prisoners charged with murder. The film shows what prison life is all about. Subjects dealing with prison survival, brutality, corruption and ultimate redemption are well shown.As the corrupt, insane warden invoking religion to justify his actions, Mr. Gunton gives a worthy performance.This is a film of rare power. James Whitmore was equally memorable as a prisoner who was unable to adjust to the outside after his parole following a 50 year stint. This shows that people who have been incarcerated for such a long period, need some sort of readjustment training before they rejoin society. For Whitmore, freedom meant ultimate doom.Politics is also depicted in a negative way in this gritty film. This is a memorable viewing experience for audiences."	10
 Good for the spirit	Stephen King's novella is a damn good yarn. The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick. And then the story is allowed to make its own way into a gentle and perfect end.This is, without any doubt, one of the most spiritually uplifting films I have ever seen.	10
 A Classic Film On Hope And Redemption	This is probably one of the best films of all time.IMDb ranks this best film of all time.It can arguably be the best film of all time considering that its message of hope and inspiration to everyone.It is a short story from Stephen King.The Shawshank Redemption is a poignant story of Andy Dufresne,a wrongly convicted killer who was sent for two life sentences to Shawshank Prison in Maine.It tells us on how Andy lived inside the walls of the Shawshank,being raped from time to time by convicted homosexuals felons,his friendship with Red,having a sense of hope despite of his seemly hopeless situation,making the most of his life by using his accounting skills by helping the guards in their income tax and cleaning the warden's dirty money and to finally escaping from prison through a hole in the wall hidden under poster of women such as Rita Hayworth and Rachel Welsh.Great acting especially by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Direction was superb by first time director Frank Darabont.The musical score was also good.I view this film from time to time to remind myself that there is hope in all situations even those I consider hopeless ones.It also a story of letting go of hatred and letting love flow into your heart despite of being around despicable characters.Aside from that,this film is neither contrived nor manipulative as it is full of surprises.It will truly be enjoyed by anybody who love great films and those who wants films that can truly uplift the human spirit.In the end,this movie will be talked about for the next 20 to 50 or more years to come.Personally it my favorite film of more than a thousand films I seen in my life for it is a classic film on hope and redemption.	10
 Greatest Movie of All time, hands down!	The Shawshank Redemption is the BEST movie of all time for many reasons. The first reason being that Morgan Freeman did his best acting job, and that is saying something. Freeman is the greatest actor of all time. Secondly, Tim Robbins gets so into his part you feel like the story is totally true and you are actually seeing it first hand. The supporting actors are wonderful as well. Enough about the acting which was second to none but the story was so compelling. The audience feels sympathy for the main character and wishes for him to be redeemed, in the end its just a feel good story. I cannot express this enough, GO WATCH THE MOVIE NOW! It is awesome and will never be topped.	10
 Best of all time!!!		10
 Over Rated	There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.	7
 A bit overrated, but still an amazing film		9
" Excellent Movie, But Not ""Greatest of All Time."""	"I finally watched The Shawshank Redemption and I agree that it is an excellent film. The pacing, directing, and storyline, holds interest throughout, along with a superb supporting cast, and a very moving ending.The main character is Andy played by Tim Robbins who is imprisoned for the murder of his wife. Later on in the movie, the evidence comes out that he is truly innocent. However The Shawshank Redemption sends a powerful message that it doesn't matter whether you are innocent or not inside Shawshank penitentiary. This is because the prison is run by a sadistic and corrupt staff. In this facility, you must use all of the intellect you can, both book smarts, and street smarts to not only stay alive, but prevent yourself from going insane within the system.Andy befriends ""Red,"" a fellow inmate, played by Morgan Freeman in another great performance. He teaches Andy street smarts of survival within Shawshank's hell-hole. Andy, an experienced banker with a master ability for finance and book learning, manipulates the prison officials to get funds to set up a ""basic skills"" learning facility within the prison's library. Red helps him organize this, and HOW Andy sets up the funding is really an amazing part of the movie. Another inmate is the head librarian, known as ""Brooks,"" who delivers many amazing scenes in the movie.What is special about The Shawshank redemption is how the characters, especially Andy and Red, are able to use their inner abilities to rise above the conditions of the prison and the people who run it. There are some disturbing and violent images that show the harsh realities of prison life, such as fighting, and often getting beaten by the staff or punished for very small offenses and a lot of times for no reason at all. The Shawshank Redemption shows the abuse of power by prison authorities and how the inmates have to have the courage to rise above this abuse, because they need to do this, in order to keep living. They learn that failure to get this courage and survival skills from other inmates will destroy them. A great quote in this film is. ""you can get busy living, or you can get busy dying."" Another interesting experience is how Red often wonders how at his advancing age he will be able to survive outside the prison if and when the parole board lets him go. An underlining message is that whether you ""get busy living or dying"" you become so accustomed to life in a controlling environment that the outside world, and the struggles, to reach it, to become physically and mentally ""free"" are an enormous challenge requiring great perseverance and the ultimate in determination.As good as this movie is, I was looking for that spark of magic that would put it at and over the top of all time classic films. However, I think that there are some outstanding prison movies that are just as good if not better than The Shawshank Redemption. Watch the Sean Penn Movie, ""Bad Boys"" for an outstanding portrayal inside and outside a juvenile prison. (Interestingly, Clancy Brown, who plays the bad officer in ""Shawshank,"" is just as good as a prison bully in ""Bad Boys."") Another great movie is ""Midnight Express"" which is (although loosely) based on the real story of Billy Hayes who was arrested in Turkey for trying to smuggle hashish back to the USA in 1970. This is another amazing survival prison picture with an unforgettable musical score and some chilling moments.I see The Shawshank Redemption equal to, but no better than ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" This is NOT a criticism of a fine movie! I am only putting The Shawshank Redemption in strikingly similar prison survival pictures that don't get the same credit that this movie does. Call this movie the greatest ever, and you have to do the same for ""Midnight Express"" or ""Bad Boys."" All three films have the same emotional impact. Another under rated movie that you should see is ""An Innocent Man,"" which is also similar to The Shawshank Redemption but is considered only above average.The Shawshank Redemption is a great film for its time. But because of similarities to other similar prison pictures, I can't classify it as great for all time"	8
 No word to describe it	Just watch it! if u watch this movie you r gonna get really strong lesson for this life ..	10
 Richly human, uplifting		10
 the Shawshank redemption is a world class film	the Shawshank redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. all the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind i simply love it. I first saw this film sitting on my brothers desk and i was intrigued by the idea of a film set in prison where hope and other morale values were the storyline instead of violence and havoc, this is a amazing film which brings pride to the actors and crew who produced it. the setting of the movie is one of perfection the Gothic grounds and the stunning facilities astound me i'am finding it hard to put in to words how much this film means to me i would say it is one of the greatest film's ever made in my time and i love it.	10
 What a movie!!!	I totally adored the concept of hope in this film. I love how the director portrays the Shawshank tyrants as corrupt murderers, that's pretty much what they are and serve as the grounds for the escape of Andy. Now Morgan Freeman's got talent, I love that guy he may not be the greatest out there but he is a force to be reckoned with on the set. I loved how he gave the story flavor with his descriptions of characters and perceptions of how life was in lonely jail cells of Shawshank. You know there's a lot more to say about this movie, it's too good too be true. Especially the ending which by the way brought tears to eyes, the most moving scene!!! Overall it was superb and all thanks to Stephen King for putting this in the form of alphabets in the first place. I'm starting to regret not reading any of his novels. And kudos to the director for even coming up with such an idea for a movie.	10
 A favourite film	When i watched this film i thought now whats this going to be like? After watching it i thought it was a brilliant film,fantastically acted with greats like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. Very realistic and definitely one of my absolute favourites of all time. At the end it made me cry and thought about life. Every time i watch it the film brings a tear to my eye. Fantastic film and worth watching,it's really realistic film and another one of stephen king's great stories, a story of hope and many people who have watched will say the same thing - if you haven't seen this film already then watch it, it is brilliant, just brilliant!!be prepared to be moved, it's such a breathtaking journey for the whole two hours. A truly lovely magical film, my favourite of all time fantastic	10
 One of the greatest movies of all time	"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."""	10
 What a beautiful movie!	"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that i've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 oscars. This movie deserves 30 oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact."	10
 Very Cool!!!	"Since I bought (a lot of years ago) a videotape with two Stephen King's short films, one of them ""The Woman In The Room"", directed by Frank Darabont, I had the strange sensation that this guy could very well become one of the good directors in the filming industry... and here we are, with another King's story he managed to do one of the best films in this decade (90's), of course, with the help of nonetheless but mr. Freeman and mr. Robbins, who could have spoiled it?"	
 one of my absolute favorites!	This is definitely one of my favorite movies -- it makes me cry and laugh and ache inside all at once.  Tim Robbins, you make my days a little brighter -- thank you!	10
" ""I Had To Go To Prison To Learn To Be A Crook"""		9

 I may be in the minority here but.......	I have literally just turned off the DVD player after watching this film for the very first (and last) time after so much hype I thought it was about time. I sat all the way through it and did enjoy it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it is a good film, yes it is a good plot. However I had guessed the outcome and a few bits within the film before the flashback at the end, and therefore for me there were no unexpected twists. I wasn't even moved at the end. In fact all in all I was a bit disappointed, as my friends who have seen it said that they had cried and it was such a brilliant film. Am I abnormal???????? I think the green mile was better and I did cry at the end of that. I'm sorry if I upset any of you who think it is the best film ever, but I don't.	
 The best movie ever?		10
 Fantastic		10
" ""I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning""."	"Well I guess I'm a little late to the party as far as writing down a review for this picture. I've seen it a couple of times, but that was before I became a regular contributor to the IMDb. When I first discovered this site a few years ago, ""The Godfather"" was in the Number #1 spot, and since then the films have traded places for first and second, with Shawshank maintaining the top spot most of the time. That puzzled me a bit until I watched it again tonight, and I've come away from the picture with a new found appreciation. My favorite movies tend to be the story of underdogs in some way, shape or form, and my personal Top Ten list includes titles like ""On The Waterfront"", ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". I may have to reconsider that list, an infrequent exercise but one I don't mind doing every now and then as situations warrant.Overall, the film is darn near perfect. I know it's pretty cliché to state it that way, but when you analyze the dialog, the characters, the directing and the tone of the movie, the picture flows flawlessly, even when it detours into side stories like Brooks Hatlen's release and new prisoner Tommy's introduction late in the picture. Every set-up, every nuance has some importance that eventually converges to symbolize Andy's quest for escape and personal redemption. Remember Brooks feeding Jake for the first time and eventually setting him free when he receives his own pardon? How about Andy playing Mozart into the prison yard while settling back with a smile of contentment on his face. The story transcends one man's confinement for a crime he didn't commit, and focuses instead on his reaction to circumstances beyond his control. Paul Newman showed us a different way to react to those kinds of conditions in 1967's ""Cool Hand Luke"", but his method was self destructive. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) never loses his ability to keep his eye on the prize, even if it takes him a couple of decades to do so.But even more so, you have here the story of Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a convict who sees Andy as a person, and over time, an inspiration to himself and the rest of the prisoners who call him friend. From Andy, he comes to understand that even as a prisoner, a man can live life on his own terms if he can keep his mind uncluttered by thoughts of desperation and hopelessness. Not bad for a convict who started out believing that 'hope can drive a man insane'.I really can't recommend this picture highly enough, both for it's masterful story telling and it's technical execution. The actors, even those portraying the most minor characters were seemingly born for their roles. They deliver a seamless performance that's virtually unmatched by most modern films, in a picture that hits all the right notes with an inspiring message of discipline and perseverance."	10
 Blatantly Simple, yet Utterly Beautiful	To tell the truth, I am speechless. I am a young movie fanatic, in fact, this film came out the same year I was born, and therefore I am more used to films incredible special effects, edge-of-your-seat action, et cetera. This film has none of that, and yet, it appeals so closely to me. The way Frank Darabont uses the narration of Red to drive on the story, the beauty of the soundtrack used (note the harmonica used just before Red's finding of the letter close to the end). The entire film, from beginning to end, from actions to sound, is a beacon of hope, judgement, and redemption. The cast is perfect, Morgan Freeman(Red) actually brings about a refreshing feel to the tale, and that is exactly what the movie is, what a movie should be. Highly recommended for every viewer, no matter your taste(or age- !judgement excludes use of language or violence!). I can't say it deserved its nO.1 position, i can't say any movie does, but if any movie should, this one might as well be it. *********	10
 The BEST movie ever made.	"Emotion, hope and justice all blend perfectly in this film. Quite simply, no other film comes close to this one in regards to screenplay, casting and plot development. No spoilers here - just a comment on a movie that can still move you to tears even after multiple viewings. Morgan Freeman delivers the performance of a lifetime. Everything else comes together in perfect harmony. This movie came out the same year as Forrest Gump which won the Oscar for best picture - Forrest Gump is a great picture but this one really deserved the ""cake"". Tim Robbins is AMAZING as Andy, and he supported brilliantly by a cast that one could only hope to see assembled again. This is one of those rare occasions where the movie actually surpasses the book for drama, suspense and flow. If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself the favour and watch it. I know you will not be disappointed!""Get busy livin'"""	10
 Simply a great story that is moving and uplifting	Andy Defresne is a young banker who goes to pieces when he learns his wife is being unfaithful.  He gets drunk and wakes in his car, where he is picked up for the murder of his wife and her lover.  Despite his pleas of innocence, Andy is sentenced to life in prison where he is immediately introduced to the horrors of live inside.  Fellow lifer, Red, tells Andy's story of how he held hope and managed to use his banking skills to improve the conditions for himself and others.I saw this film in the cinema when it came out and, looking back, it is surprising how little fuss was made over it at the time - I was one of 15 or 20 people in the cinema when I saw it (on it's second week out!).  However time has brought it to the top of many popular lists of films and it is mainly due to a story that is based around friendship and hope that engages and eventually uplifts.If you are going to adapt a Stephen King book, the lesson from this film and others appears to be to adapt a short one.  Here the story is set up well with all the usual stuff that we expect from prison dramas, but with the key difference that these events are not the film - no the film is about Andy and Red's friendship.  These two men are great characters and I was very easily drawn into their story.  It is witty, dark and yet enjoyable all at the same time.  It is impossible not to be affected by the ending and this simple uplifting sentiment is part of the reason it has been taken in by so many viewers as one of their favourites.Of course it is a little long at times and for my personal tastes it is a little too sentimental at times although this is to be expected with any Hollywood film.  The slightly sentimental view of the prison also goes so far to ignore the idea that there would be any homosexual relationship that aren't rape and even ruling out any suggestion of racism - there is no tension or segregation in evidence here.  I won't do spoilers but the ending was too clear for me where leaving us with more questions would have been more in holding with the idea of hope that the film had traded in prior to this.  The characters work well due to some great performances.  Robbins is great as Andy and he ages and grows well - whether or not he is believable in his calm approach to the punishment he takes is another matter, but I was caught up in the film enough to get past that.  Freeman may not be the Irish guy from the book (hence the name Red) but he is excellent as the father figure - even if he appears to age very slowly in comparison to Andy.  The chemistry between the two is the key and it really works.Of course having a support cast that includes a great number of fine support actors probably helped.  People like Gunton, Sadler, Bellows and others may not always be great but here they fit the bill. Yes the characters tend to be very clichéd (the bird man, the rapists etc) but again that comes with the genre and I was able to get past these by focusing on the main relationship.  The surprise performance for me was from Clancy Brown - not the most subtle of actors (Highlander is his other famous role) but he is very good here indeed, albeit with little actual character depth.  As director Darabont has done very well, framing some great shots (that crane shot as the bus arrives for the first time) as well as a shot that has become almost iconic.  He is helped by a score that fits the sweeping sense of hope that the film brings.Overall this is an imperfect film and it is flattered by it regular high appearance on the popular `best film' lists.  However it is also a great little story that twists and turns as it is told, it has all the clichés of the genre but at it's heart it is based on friendship and a sense of hope that it is hard not to find uplifting.  For all it's faults it is a popular and moving story that seems to do the trick for the majority of those that see it.	
 i swear	I have never watched a better movie than this before	10
 Hope is wonderful	No matter what it is, hope cannot be closed. Everything is caused by hope. Is it because of the inner hope that countless hard work, hard work, and unrelenting returns? With hope, Shawshank Prison is nothing but a hope. With a hope, a small hammer can redeem life, redeem freedom, and even Shark Castle (Shawshank Prison).	10
 Amazing	As I was saying just amazing, it makes you laugh, cry and even shout	10
 nice	Nice title :) 10/10 best one i have seen my dude couldn't get any better	10
 Fantastic	Wish I could go back in time and see it for the first time again, because the story moved me deeply. Fantastic movie all the way through, not a single issue to report here.	10
 Tied for the best movie	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Hope	Maybe it's silly but sometime when I face a tough situation in my life and I feel powerless and hopeless; I remember how Andy dug a tunnel with his rock hammer for 19 years, 19 YEARS.. to gain his freedom.For me it's simple. This movie gives me hope.	10

 A very very well told story	"Okay, the movie is 25 years old. Why write a review so long afterwards? Because the film deserves, the director deserves it, the actors deserve it and, more importantly, you deserve it. ""Prison"" films generally impact, showing people deprived of the most basic right, come and go. More shocking if the prisoner seems innocent, and even more so if prison conditions are very severe. Mix all this with great performances, beautiful locations, a soundtrack that is neat and does not steal the scene and you will have an exciting story of overcoming and hope. In such a mistreated garden, it is almost a miracle that one can cultivate hope, but still so it is with Andy Dufresne, unjustly condemned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Sentenced to life imprisonment, Andy will spend the next 20 years dealing with violence, threats, and will maintain his sense of ""usefulness"" by helping to improve the lives of the dents, helping the corrupt director launder money, and dreaming of Morgan Freeman, his friend from prison. With all of this, Andy remains true to himself, dreaming of days of freedom, even when alerted by his friend: that hope can be dangerous in certain situations, leading a man to desperate decisions if it does not come to fruition.ok, o filme tem 25 anos. Porque escrever um review tanto tempo depois? Porque o filme merece, o diretor merece, os atores merecem e, mais importante, você merece. Filmes ""de prisão"" geralmente causam impacto, mostrando pessoas privadas do mais básico direito, ir e vir. Mais impactante se o prisioneiro parecer inocente, e ainda mais se dentro da prisão as condições forem muito severas. Misture tudo isso com ótimas atuações, belíssimas locações, trilha sonora caprichada e que não rouba a cena e você terá uma história emocionante de superação e esperança. Num jardim tão maltratado, é quase um milagre que alguém consiga cultivar esperança, mas ainda assim é o que acontece com Andy Dufresne, injustamente condenado pelo assassinato da esposa e do amante dela. Condenado a prisão perpétua, Andy passará os próximos 20 anos lidando com violência, ameaças, e manterá seu senso de ""utilidade"" ajudando a melhorar a vida dos dententos, ajudando o diretor corrupto a lavar dinheiro, e sonhando com Red (Morgan Freeman), seu amigo de prisão. Com tudo isso, Andy se mantêm fiel a si mesmo, sonhando com dias de liberdade, até mesmo quando alertado por seu amigo: que a esperança pode ser perigosa em certas situações, levando um homem a decisões desesperadas se não se transforma em realidade."	10
 A timeless masterpiece. A heart wrenching drama. An epic tale of true friendship.		10
 Hen I sa	"Hen I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'"	10
 Redeeming.	"The Shawshank Redemption (1994): Dir: Frank Darbont / Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore, Bob Gunton, William Sadler: Gripping film about finding refuge in a place of despair. Tim Robbins plays banker Andy Dufresne in 1947, convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. The verdict is not the issue, but rather his familiarizing himself into routine life within prison walls. He faces the trials of violent leering inmates but forms a bond with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, played by Morgan Freeman. Redding can get things for a price and soon Andy has items smuggled into his cell. Andy finds favor when his banking comes into play and doing taxes for the corrupt Christian warden and the guards. Andy is able to improve the library but discovers a scheme by the warden that leaves him to his own devices when proof of his innocence is sabotaged. Director Frank Darabont paints the grim and depressing portrait of prison and populates it with personalities struggling to exist within. Robbins is at his best as a victim adapting and improving his circumstance before intelligence wins out. Freeman is great as the humble and resourceful Redding. James Whitmore plays aged librarian Brooks whose release leads to questions regarding freedom verses existence. Bob Gunton is effective as the ruthless warden. Redemption is freedom of mind and soul whether in prison or in opportunity. Score: 10 / 10"	10
 Nice Movie		10
 My Favorite Movie of All-time	Enough has been said of this masterpiece, so I'll keep my review succinct. This truly is my favorite movie of all-time, because no matter how many times I see it, I still get the genuine feeling of hope the film has delivered since the first time I saw it. Everything about this movie is perfect; from the cinematography, to the acting, the casting, the writing...everything. It's a fantastic example of the power of hope and the true nature of the human spirit. When you watch it, you just know that every scene is classic; so many moments will be remembered forever in film history. If anything, it just keep getting better with each time I see it. I will continue to enjoy this film for the rest of my life.	10
 must see movie!		10
" ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged"""		10
 A moving masterpiece.	From the summary above which you will have seen, i stated the film to be a moving masterpiece. Right from the word go i was drawn into the films twisting emotional plot. It caught my attention that Frank Darabont has placed a small amount of aspects into the film that get the audience emotionally involved in which we base ourselves into simply putting our feet in one of the convicts shoes. Tt especially caught my eyes with the montage of shots in which the character Brooks (James Whitmore) takes his own life, the non-diagetic sound adding to the other element of suspense of the scene and the devastation of the tragic loss of the character in which we have been following through the course of the film. The cinematography throughout the film was basic and what i would term as standard, seen before basic film camera-work. If this was better it would have highly improved the films overall watch. throughout the course of the film we see Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) supposedly framed for the murder of his wife and her lover. We see how he progresses through the twenty years he spends at Shawshank Prison. We see Robbins act brilliantly as the role of a nimble, lost and lonely convict turn into a reliant of the Head Warden. This all becomes of the fact that in Dufresne's previous life he was a city banker, which is where he gets the nickname of 'wife murdering banker' around the dim lit prison. Morgan Freeman also shows that he is one of the worlds leading role- modelling actors as he pulls of another supreme unique perform. The way he acts during the duration of the film is entirely versatile proving the Freeman is an exceptional actor and performs single handed an outstanding performance.The plot consists of many twists and turns with both leading characters getting into difficult situation and how they overcome them, or not.The final half an hour of the film is soul touching and what i would term as an emotional rollacoaster with a large twist at the end. As suspense builds it creates a sensational climax tagging the film a must watch!I generally don't watch films more than once or twice but this is a different story. It still amazes me to this day and still gets me moving every time, it also influences me a lot.If you haven't watched this i highly recommend you do so!Joe Ferrari	
 Sublimely powerful.	"It deserves ten stars. Its beauty lies in its slow pace and genteel wit, although some may not have the patience for the slowness. But the whole premise of life inside a prison cell makes better sense when told in a calm, emotion-building, pace such as this. Otherwise, one would never get to know Tim Robbins's quiet accountant (and what makes him appear alternately shy, snobbish, and suicidal all at the same time); or Morgan Freeman's genial-but-cynical lifer- not to mention how he's ""a man who knows how to get things."" I love what the film doesn't do: it doesn't make an issue of its two leads being different races (although one could claim that makes their friendship all the more marvelous), it doesn't pull any sensational, far-out, action punches (as films with an all-male cast often do), and it doesn't freeze its characters into types. Everyone is real and everyone is flawed- from James Whitmore's bird loving veteran to Bob Gunton's pretentious, icy, warden. But the finish (which really starts around the film's last twenty minutes) is one of the most powerful and moving things ever committed to film. Get it in either format."	
 Movie you can see 1000 times	"I made my account on IMDb Just to Rate this movie. :-) I had heard from someone that Tim Robins has done a great job in this movie. but when i started watching this movie, i could not move my ass for 142 Min.its not just about Tim Robins or Morgen Freeman.. its the whole storyline,dialogs and cinematography which insist you to watch this whenever you feel low in your life.Movie has some great lines. When Andy(Tim Robins) brake the Jail, Morgon Freeman says ""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright"" This movie has entertainment, Feelings, Action, Drama a little comedy. In short everything we want to see in a movie.I have seen this movie around 100 times and sure will watch more then 10000 times before i die. 1 of the best movies i have ever seen in my life.. Wish i could see that sort of movie again in my life"	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"A friend of mine listed ""The Shawshank Redemption"" as one her all time favorite movies and that brought on my curiosity what Shawshank Redemption was, I even thought it was a typo. The next day I went out and brought home the 10 years anniversary DVD without knowing I was going to spend the most worthwhile 2 and a half hours of my life in front of the TV (a melodrama doesn't kill, right?)I don't know how to write a good movie review so I guess telling you what I feel about it may do better. I remembered crying a few times, being astounded by the plot twist for a moment or two and ending up sitting alone, inert and all, just because of the once-in-a-lifetime beauty of Shawshank. Just recall the scene in which Andy locked himself in the room and turned the music on, all the cons stood paralyzed on the ground, listening to the magical tune like the song of hope they had never heard before.Shawshank is more than a feel good movie, it's about life-changing experiences, about the endless struggle against life's harshness and unfairness, about true friends who will stand by you forever... The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.Shawshank should have won every Oscar for any categories it was nominated, but it's all about struggling against unfairness, time's proved its monumental magnitude.Shawshank is a lesson of life that you have to learn in just 150 minutes."	10
 Magical film	I remember when i first saw this film. my friend kept telling me to watch it as he thought it was brilliant. well, all good things come to those who wait yes? i did something I had never done before or since: when i finished watching it i rewound it and watched it again straight after.It has a perfect cast, story and the best ending of any film i have ever seen.To sum up in one word: magical!	10
 The greatest movie ever!		
 Emotionally Fulfilling	"From the director of 1990's ""Buried Alive"" comes perhaps the strongest drama of 1994. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is emotionally fulfilling in every way, uplifting its audience again and again. Darabont's screenplay, adapted from (and expanded upon) Stephen King's short novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", is at once soul stirring, heart-rending and disarmingly funny. As director, Frank Darabont brings this poignant and oft times surprising (largely unpredictable thank goodness) script to the screen with the kind of loving care that only a writer/director can, ensuring that all the right elements are brought to the surface.Startling performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and the entire support cast help make this picture a powerful production. As convicted double murderer Andy Du Fresne, Robbins portrays innocence and determination superbly. He's a man who not only strongly believes he has a future, but that it's a good one. Freeman is spot on as the world weary ""Red"", the lifer who specialises in the supply of merchandise (""whatever you want"") to other inmates. He is gradually transformed, and always surprised, by Andy's optimism, geniality and brilliance. In support of these two leads are some very strong turns which provide an over all feast of superlative acting talents.The cinematography is superb, capturing some spectacular images of the foreboding Shawshank prison, while Thomas Newman's music is awe inspiring and must be duly recognised as a truly moving composition.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a long movie, though it would seem that to shorten it would mean to miss out on some powerful, if not crucial scenes. In this light, the editing team have done a marvellous job.What makes this film so effective is Darabont's brilliant script and astute direction, coupled with the strong acting and great support production. Darabont achieves all his objectives, making us laugh, cry, listen and think, he both surprises and inspires us many times. We're left in the end with an uplifting and wholly satisfying movie, which is unexpectedly memorable and magnificently rewarding. A definite triumph of the human spirit.Perhaps the conclusion could be called simplistic, but certainly not expected, and that's what makes this story so great. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes from nowhere to really hit you with its well written characters and even its carefully researched history. Wonderfully emotionally telling and thankfully intellectually sharp, its a pleasure that you must treat yourself to! Look for two brilliantly played characters in the form of the menacingly sinister Warden (Bob Gunton) and the despicable, ruthlessly violent Captain of the Guards (Clancy Brown).Thursday, July 27, 1995 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema""The Shawshank Redemption"" was the surprise of 1994 from director Frank Darabont. Full of emotional highs both comic and poignant, it is by far the best prison film I've ever seen. Performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are truly inspired, whilst a classy support cast lend strong backing. Cinematography is at times breathtaking and Thomas Newman's score is sweeping and melodic.For uplifting cinema that constantly comes form nowhere to move its audience you can't go past ""The Shawshank Redemption.""Tuesday, April 30, 1996 - Astor Theatre"	8
 never give up hope	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" should have won Best Picture for 1994. A story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) getting falsely convicted of murder and sent to the hellish Shawshank prison, the movie is beyond amazing. In prison, Andy meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who was imprisoned many years earlier. Red gets Andy a poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the next twenty years, Andy experiences all the horrors that one would expect in jail: beatings by the guards, rapes by other inmates, and so on. But he never gives up hope.This movie, like ""Carrie"", ""The Shining"", ""Dolores Claiborne"", ""The Green Mile"" and ""Hearts in Atlantis"", just goes to show what a great author Stephen King is. When we think of horror, we think of spooky horror, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a different kind: personal horror. Pure genius. I can only hope that in the coming years, this movie is recognized as what it is: a masterpiece. I can't believe that it won no Oscars!"	10
 If other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more		8
 Once in a lifetime movie	An excellent movie that can surely move you a bit. It throws open the question that can we really have prisons which are redemption centers in the true sense. At the same time, it redefines the word criminal. Are the heinous acts committed by administrative authorities justifiable by any means. There should be a code of conduct for the authorities and a HOLY PRISON MAINTENANCE BIBLE if any reformation has to take place. The movie goes through several touching incidents and may bore you a bit if you rarely sees serious touching movies and are fans of slick sci-fi thrillers moving at extraordinary pace like Matrix etc. However the exceptional acting by lead stars particularly by Morgan Freeman and the picking up of the tempo in the second half will leave you gasping for more. After Citizen Kane, Casablanca & Godfather, it is another classic that will stay in the echelons of the movie rating lists for long. There are a few weak points though. There was insufficient attention given to some characters and movie portrays just one side of the whole story not remaining fair to the prison authorities. And finally if it was told in a non-linear tale then it would have been much more interesting	
 Why it is ranked so highly.		
 What's SO special?	"This is a good movie, and surely is right up there among the finest prison/concentration camp depictions which almost ALWAYS have at least competent quality. In my mind I compare this genre to ""submarine""-films: confined space, lots of guys under constant threat, therefore drama and tension easily created without much sweat (ha ha). But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama ""The Green Mile"", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters. Or maybe the majority of movie-goers consider what they're watching at face value and never mind that ""I've seen this all before""-feel. Or maybe they haven't or just have a lousy memory? Yes I admit, I'm something of a cynic. But I also believe I'm able to spot an truly honest effort when I see one. Probably that's the reason why I consider the grandpa of them all, Mervyn LeRoy's 1932 ""I'm A Fugitive From A Chain Gang"" as the all-time best prison-flick. No film-snobbery here, as I hope you'll agree when you see this true classic."	7
 The best film ever made!	'The Shawshank Redemption' is the best film ever made in the history of world cinema! The Best Hollywood Film Of All-Time! A Masterpiece! A cult classic! A legendary Epic! A Film that you moves you, leaves you stunned!Performances: Tim Robbins is astounding, his careers finest after Mystic River. Morgan Freeman is masterful, his careers finest after Million Dollar Baby. Others are excellent.'The Shawshank Redemption' is cinema at its very best. My salute to this flick! A true Masterpiece! I just love this film! The most powerful film of all-time.	10
 #2 in the TOP 250 is right!!!	"I saw this movie for the first time a year ago. In those days I was browsing the IMDb when I saw this movie ranked #2 in the top 250. That was very weird for me because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. So I decided to go and rent it immediately. After watching the movie I was positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! Thanks IMDb and all IMDb users for the top 250 and the wake-up call!"	10
 just great	Thanx to everybody who helped to put Shawshank back to rank 2 in the top 250, in front of LotR3, where it belongs. I've seen this movie about 20 times and I never get tired of it. That's what makes a movie the best. The first 2 in the top 250 are where they belong. The 3 LotR-movies should be out of the top 10. They should create a category for special effects. Put them on top there. But for a great movie it need a lot more then effects. The story of Shawshank is absolutely great. The actors did their best. It's still a shame, that this great movie didn't got a single Oscar. It could have win the best picture in most years against all winners.	10
 Best Ever	How many ways can I list why this is best movie of all time?1.  The most perfect ending of any movie I've ever seen. 2.  Best story - Steven King (not even a fan of his) 3.  Best acting performance: Morgan Freeman, absolutelyamazing, best ever (Tim Robbins is brilliant also) 4.  Best narration - Morgan Freeman's character 5.  Most uplifting, touching, moving story ever told. 6.  Outstanding soundtrack 7.  Beautiful cinematography. 8.  Most evil antagonist - The warden 9. Best dialogue - so many memorable phrases and quotes!I could keep going.  I've never encountered a movie that has touched so many people.	10
 Highly Overrated But Still Good	"A good prison movie whose cult of fans has made it into something so much more than it is. Greatest movie ever made? Get real. It's not even the greatest prison movie ever made. Hell, it's not even the best movie released in 1994! It's predictable and borrows heavily from decades of prison movie clichés. It's also nowhere near as deep as its staunchest admirers would have you believe. Still, it's an entertaining movie. Nice direction from Frank Darabont. Morgan Freeman is the highlight with a solid supporting cast. Tim Robbins, however, is borderline ridiculous at times with his cartoonish facial expressions and silly ""stares-off-into-the-distance"" moments. He's so far beneath Freeman as an actor it's sad. With a normal movie like this, I would focus more on the positives. I did give it a 7, after all. Unfortunately, it is easily the most overrated movie of all time (on IMDb, for sure) and as such the balance of positive to negative is out of whack."	7
 Hope is a dangerous thing	'The Shawshank Redemption'... hmm where do I start. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly one of the greatest films ever, I find that it really can show what it would be like trapped in a tiny little prison, eventually you would only think of what's outside the prison instead of inside or you might even become attached to the prison or should I say home.What the audience really enjoy's about this movie is that you have been deceived for you believe through out most of the movie that there is noway out for poor Andy Dufresne and that he is trying to be nice to the guards for a chance of believable. After that you discover that the whole film and everything that has happened has all gone towards the escape of Andy Dufresne and the suicide of the dreadful warden. The audience has been gullible enough to believe that Andy was getting used to the prison. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is clearly not just a movie, it is also beautiful art. Every little piece of the movie was delicately put together to create pure yet daunting art.The story is about Andy Dufresne a wealthy intelligent banker who's wife is having an affair with another man. Eventually both the wife and the other man are killed while having sex, with all evidence pointing to Andy, Andy is sentenced to two life times of prison. In prison Andy does a lot of the workers at the prison's (and that include's the warden) banking. From then of the story is all about Andy in the prison and he idea's of hope and love of music.One of the most beautiful and touching moments in the movie is when Andy locks all the doors in the room that has the microphone and plays opera music of two Italian women singing opera in Italian. Morgen Freeman then say's that he had no idea what the two Italian women were singing but doesn't want to know, he just like to imagine that the words were too beautiful to be sung in English.The acting is brilliant and the directing is directed absolutely unbelievably tremendous. I praise both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins for a very touching movie that I will always remember.In conclusion, 'The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest films ever that I have ever seen, if you do not like it I will also understand that you didn't listen closer to the brilliant word that were able to come out of the actors mouth.Hope is a dangerous thing.	10
 Instantly put on my top-5 of all time list	Let me tell you a little story. I am 17 years old and consider myself an avid movie buff. From Braveheart to American History X to Pulp Fiction to Schindler's List to The Matrix, I thoroughly enjoy watching and talking about great movies. After being desensitized by the poor gore-fest known as Hostel, I came home and watched this movie with some friends. Let me tell you that this is one of two movies I can think of that has made me tear up. I don't do it often, and I certainly wasn't expecting to tonight. But the Shawshank Redemption tantalizes your mind and touches your soul. It is a triumph of motion picture and tonight became of of my top five favorite movies of all time. Please go see this in its entirety if you have not.	10
 My second favorite movie of all time		10
 Those lil´ movies that...	This movie is one of those ones that makes you think really deep about life, your life!       Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere.	10
 The greatest transition from confinement to freedom ever portrayed in film	Not only is this film one of the most touching I have ever seen, it also has one of the most unexpected and inspiring endings I have ever seen.  The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I've heard	10
 the best movie in the world ever made	simply the best movie ever made. this movie embraces the philosophy that justice will be done, karma is heard and that goodness will rule above anything in this world. Andy and reds friendship is a strong unique bond, founded under the harshest of circumstances. In prison they each serve their time for situations they got themselves into, but certainly didn't form them as men - or messed with their true character. Andy has no choice but to try and accept his fate, that he will be in Shawshank forever - and on the surface he rises to the occasion by doing the paperwork for the sadistic warden, who treats Andy like the lowest of the low. In the meantime Reds parole is continuously declined, and they both have to re-adjust, even though their life in prison sometimes offers them glimpses of hope and of freedom. Will the time really come, and if yes...are they ready for it?	10
 So it's not everyday that you watch the greatest movie of your lifetime.		10
 The best movie ever, excellent is a small word for this movie!	I am bowled over by this movie. This is simply the best movie ever made. The story just leaves you moved and the performances in the movie are clearly the best performances ever on screen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman enact their roles to perfection, they don't miss out even a dot in fulfilling the roles to excellency.I cant believe i waited so long before i actually watched this movie, i should have watched it before, and then over and over again.Don't be scared to watch this movie, you will be amazed by this masterpiece. I cant stop raving, I say WATCH IT NOW! 10 on 10 isn't enough!	10
 Perfectly written. Perfectly directed. Perfectly cast. Perfectly acted. Perfect		10
 Truly brilliant, moving and flawless.	I know 'Best Movie Ever' sounds like such a cliché, a phrase used to death. Many people use it on movies which really do not deserve to be called the best movie ever. I believe that the phrase ' Best Movie Ever' should be reserved for one movie only. The Shawshank Redemption. Not so long ago on IMDb, The Shawshank Redemption was ranked 2nd. This, naturally, compelled me to buy it, and then i discovered what makes up a truly great movie.Simple plot, wonderfully acted and directed.Since watching The Shawshank Redemption, i have been preaching to all my friends to watch it. And here i must do the same. It is ranked #1 on IMDb for a reason. It is the best ever. It will move you. You will love it. If you haven't seen it, watch it.10/10	10
 This is a film that you live, not watch		10
 One word. Outstanding.	"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption."""	10
 Robbed at the Academy Awards	By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do. The ending is one of the most satisfying in movie history.	10
 Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things.	Truly a masterpiece of cinema.  I hope this film gets the critical recognition it deserves as the years go by.  Almost everyone i have encountered has loved this film.  How did it not win oscars galore.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are simply perfect in what is essentially a love story.  A love of hope, a love of friendship and a love of life, no matter the constraints.  I LOVE THIS FILM!	10
 Superb prison buddy story - but sadly unimportant film		9
 Good movie but not a #1 movie of all time	This is a good movie but it is far from being the best movie I have ever seen. The plot is ok but with many plot holes that I don't find really convincing. What do I mean by that? Well, the way that Andy dig the tunnel from his prison cell for years and that nobody noticed because it was behind a simple pretty girl poster.This movie is probably among the first movies about life in prison like this but these scenes are now so cliche (prison rape, creepy guy approach in shower, corrupt officers, etc.) and to me they are so predictable. I like movies to be unpredictable but with this one I guessed everything that was about to happen.It's just so unconvincing that he is able to run like that and to even be accompanied by Red later (like no one would follow Red to see if he takes them to Andy).	6
 Maybe The Best Movie Ever Made	If you are looking for an inspiring jorney to feel the magic of life, you should stop searching and watch this title.	10
 my best	It's the best plot everthis film is one of the best films that made my day i watched it over 20 times and i learned many things from it every time i watched it	10
 Very best movie i ever watch		9
 All-time prison film classic	"Based on a novella by Stephen King, this is better than even THE GREEN MILE and goes to show that you don't need supernatural elements in a prison story – the setting is enough to carry a film as it is. SHAWSHANK often shows up as the ""best film of all time"" on various movie lists - including here on the IMDb - and, whilst I don't necessarily agree about that, it is a very good film indeed, near flawless in fact.Every technical element of the film is spot-on, from direction to music, editing, and acting; Morgan Freeman delivers his best ever performance whilst Tim Robbins shows us what a great character actor he is. Even better, for a genre fan like me, is seeing acting favourites like Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Brian Libby, and James Whitmore all appearing in the film together and playing more than just stock good or bad guy roles. Every actor is great here, and the script (which sticks closely to King's writing) is nigh-on perfect. Emotion, thrills, drama, and the triumph of the human spirit are all present in this movie, which is one of the greatest prison flicks ever."	10
 The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made.		10
 A classic piece of unforgettable film-making by Frank Darabont		10
 One of the best movies I have ever watched in my life	''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 great	Was a great Movie !! I love the story and the actors were fantastic. There is so much to say about this movie. But look, seriously, look and say it is not a great movie from beginning to end. Of course a good soundtrack also makes a great movie, so the soundtrack also has to be mentioned. The Movie Picture is very good. good angles of shooting, always transmitting us the space inside the prison. or rather the space that we have not. And finally, check out this great movie. they repented and were left with a better perspective for life. See the movie, enjoy and learn! To finish just saying that it as a great movie, oh wait, i already said that, no problem its to highlight the idea.	10
 A fantastic movie to enjoy	I consider this movie as one of the most fantastic and joyful movie to watch. It touch a social problem that few movie directors and producers took the risk of doing like the institutionalized thing. All of the stories developed in this movie even if they are all related of the main character, every own little story is very interesting and full of emotions. This movie contains good drama, a different comedy insight. I think I have seen this movie at least 6 times and I just don't get tire of watch in it i think every time i watch it i found new things.I highly recommend to spend time enjoying this amazing movie and just a piece of advice is take the time to read a little bit the reviw and find no one bad.	10
 The Best Movie of all Time	"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that creates a sense of mystery and power. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie by displaying their roles as best friends. After watching that movie for the first time, I remembered clips that are drilled into my mind forever. It is beautifully written and directed. The scene that sticks out to me is at the end of the movie when Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding reunite at the end of the movie. This promotes the aspect of friendship that will live on forever. Even though these two men have lived in prison for years, they eventually got out (well Andy escaped) and they still managed to find one of the most important things in their lives, each other. I recommend this movie to all ages. Although this movie may be a complex the first time you watch it, but after several other times, it still creates a sense of thrill and hope for the viewers. 10 out of 10!"	10
 A film beyond greatness.		10
 What More Can I Say?		10
 Brilliant & Excellent		10
 One of my all time favorites.		10
 information	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) bides his time during twenty years' imprisonment for the murder of his wife in this adaptation of a Stephen King story. And being Stephen King, the setting is once again Maine, though you'll find 'Shawshank State Prison' in Ohio. It's the forbiddingly Gothic Mansfield Reformatory, 100 Reformatory Road, Mansfield, on US Route 30, about 80 miles southwest of Cleveland.Built between 1886 and 1910, the reformatory remained in operation until 1990 and was scheduled for demolition when the film was made. In fact, much of the prison yard has now gone to make room for the adjacent Richland Correctional Institution, but the striking Administration Building lives on as a tourist attraction. Find it just north of downtown Mansfield, off South Olivesburg Road.	9
 One of the Greatest Films of All Time.	And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.	10
 My favourite move of all time	"Well let me start off by saying I felt compelled to write this review to spite the numerous people who give it a 1 out of 10 ""because they feel it should be lower then a 9.3"" and go on to write what they really think, to you people I write this: you should vote it according to what you think the movie should be, i.e. if you think the movie deserves an 8 out of 10 then you should vote as such, I think this movie deserves a 10 out of 10 and so I have given it as such.As for the movie, I can't tell you how incredible it is in my opinion, it is the only movie to date I could watch again and again, and not get tired of watching it, the cast was spot on everything was perfect, the subjugation of the prisons by Captain Hadley, all of it was simply spot on, honestly speaking I don't know how people could watch this and fail to see how truly amazing it is, well deserving of its number 1 spot on IMDb.Also I read that people don't understand how Andy ""pinned"" the pictures to his wall, it could be either celotape or bluetac and as you see during the movie, Andy works from under the poster when digging his hole so there is no plot hole of ""how he put the poster back up after entering the hole"" because the poster never gets taken down."	10
 For Everyone who Gave This Movie a 1	I have written a few reviews on IMDb and Shawshank is one of my favorite movies of all time. I don't necessarily think this movie was a 10 but an easy 9 for me. I am giving it a 10 because of the negative reviews that I read with saying they gave this movie a 1 just because others had given it a 10. As far I'm concerned it's mine to give, if I want to to give every a movie a 10, (which by the way I don't). I am just sick of people telling me that a movie can't be great because it was story driven and not character driven, maybe I like story driven movies, I certainly liked this one. So here's another 10 for you movie snobs will have to eradicate.	10
 Now here is a classic		9
 Masterful.	"***WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*** In 2007, the American Film Institute released the 10th anniversary edition of their 100 Years...100 Movies list. On this, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was listed at #72. I find it insulting it was ranked so low.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works (e.g., Stand By Me, Misery, The Green Mile, etc.) but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding.For those of you who don't know what Shawshank is about, it concerns a banker named Andy Dufresne - played by Tim Robbins - who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his philandering wife and her lover and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. He becomes close friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), the film's narrator who has a reputation for being able to ""get things"" from the outside world for the other prisoners. He and Andy become the best of friends as the years go by, during which time Andy's financial knowhow becomes an asset to the prison guards, particularly the corrupt Warden, who uses Andy as an accomplice in his money-laundering operation.Shawshank explores themes of redemption and hope. Throughout his time in prison, Andy refuses to accept the hopelessness of his situation and maintains his integrity and self-worth, which ultimately pays off at the conclusion of the film. Likewise, Red finds redemption and solace through his friendship with Andy, by performing acts of common decency that, in turn, build his own sense of integrity, self-worth and hope.It is these themes that do not make Shawshank a great film but an excellent one. The visual style should be applauded, particularly Frank Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' cinematography. While the characters communicate and interact freely, they are nonetheless trapped within the confines of the prison, accurately captured by the dark tone of the atmosphere that Deakins and Darabont create so well.The performances in this film are masterful. Tim Robbins' lead performance as Andy Dufresne is skillful and nuanced. Each line is delivered flawlessly, his body language and subtle facial expressions are perfect in capturing the character's calm, laconic yet hopeful demeanour. His performance surely merited an Oscar nomination and deserved more recognition than it had from major award ceremonies.The performance of Morgan Freeman is also one to be noted. His narration is superb, and he never fails to connect with the audience. Particularly in the last quarter of the film, Freeman gives solid proof of why he is one of the finest actors alive.The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the best movie of all time and deserved more recognition than it had. Held in high regards by critics and viewers everywhere, it serves as a testament to Frank Darabont's skill as a director and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's skills as actors. It is surely to go down as one of the modern classics of filmmaking and is up there with ""The Godfather"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"" and ""Gone with the Wind."" One of the greatest achievements in cinema in recent times."	10
 A true masterpiece for any film-goer.	"'The Shawshank Redemption' is perhaps one of, if not the, perfect film. Every other ""great film"", or any film for that matter has it's pros and cons. Most motion pictures that are as well received as this have plenty going for it, very few against it. While I feel there are films out there with better pros; the pro to con ratio of 'The Shawshank Redemption' out-stands any other film film ever produced. I can't begin to describe every amazing element of this film. Obviously the performances are exquisite, the directing is exceptional and the score is extraordinary. The cinematography, in particular, struck me. Roger Deakins is a master with light and framing. I will watch this film again and again and remember it as one of the greatest films ever made. This film truly lies within the sweet spot of cinema."	9
 I thought I'd discovered this movie		10
 Salvation	There are only a few movies that one will see in their lifetime that affects the course of your life. I have loved The Shawshank Redemption since I first saw it, but only recently had its powerful effect shown to me. In short order I lost my father to illness, my wife to separation, and my career to anger and dismay. Lost in depression, mired in pain, and alone in a large house I watched it again. Between Brooks suffering, Red's hatred of hope, and Andy's response to his final isolation, I stopped feeling alone. It is simple...get busy living or get busy dying. This movie gave me the strength to start over. The movie is popular for many reasons, but it has a healing power for people trapped in their own Shawshank.	10
 You'll get it when you see it.	A very, very, very brilliant film. The acting is superb from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, as always. The script was amazing, along with the directing. The film is one of the best films ever made due to how original it is. And the reason it is original is because it is a prison film with heart. It makes you care about criminals. The score is also very good.It's an enthralling piece of cinema and just... Amazing. I'd recommend this film to anyone due to everyone relating to it. People like films were you are sympathetic towards a criminal, just look at A Clockwork Orange.	9
 awesome movie	awesome movie...the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb...one of my favorite movies...!!! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.	10
 Shawashank Redemption astonishes me !!!	I've heard of this movie before i saw it, to be honest not a single disagree on the perfectness of the actors or the production or the story or the dialogue, man!!! when i saw it i agreed and supported it to the last very minute, its one of the best movies i ever watched and it really deserve to the 1st top movie in the American cinema's history ... I'd like to thank all the people who worked in or share in it, i give it up for their great effort that will last in every one's memory for his life time. I'm sorry for my weak expression as I am impressed and my words may fail me, I did my best to deliver what i think. Hope to see new production with this kind of quality and this kind of mastering in every single detail.	10
 Words are unable to talk about it!!!!	"2417th review!!!! Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words"""	10
 One of the best - of all time. Seriously.		9
 Brilliant. Moved me in a way I never thought possible.	"Im not going to sit here and go into a deep explanation of what this film is about, because that has been thoroughly explained in many of the other reviews. What I will say is that The Shawshank Redemption is without any doubt the most amazing film ever written. The acting is tremendous, the story is original, and the movie itself has a deeper meaning to it. This movie is not about the hardships of prison, it is about the importance of friendship and the realization that hope is your greatest aspect. This piece does not focus as much on Andy and his great escape from Shawshank, but more on Red finding that there is always meaning and a purpose for everything. The story really unfolds when Brooks, an old timer that Andy and Red had been close friends with, is put on parole and released from prison. After confronting the outside world and knowing that he could not cope with it, Brooks finds that he has no purpose outside of life in jail and hangs himself. Later in the movie, after Andy makes his great escape from prison, Red is finally released from Shawshank himself, and is put in the same situation as Brooks. Only one reason marks the fact that Red himself didn't commit suicide. That reason is Andy. Red figures out that he does have a purpose outside of prison which is to see his best friend again and to ""give him a handshake"". And as the movie comes to a marvelous ending, that hope to see Andy becomes a reality.Overall the best movie I have ever watched and I am glad to say that I will continue to keep watching it again and again and again."	10
 Hope never gives up on you	Belonging to the younger generation, I often wondered what all the fuss about this movie was all about. I am a big fan of action movies, I normally do not watch movies that have a slow storyline. Inception , I always thought, was my favourite. Then I one day decided to watch the Shawshank Redemption. I was moved to the core of my heart. The movie instantly became my all-time favourite. It proved to me that, no matter how dark the tunnel may seem, there is always a light burning at the end of it. Its never too late to give up on hope. It keeps you burning bright, in spite of the incessant and seemingly undeserved storms all around you, till the time life may finally turn around for you. For if your light is not burning till then, you will never make it to that moment. This is what this movie has taught me. If you are feeling down about anything in your life, this is the movie you always wanted to watch.	10
" Review of ""The Shawshank Redemption"""	"What to say about the ""Shawshank Redemption""? I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is freakin' immaculate. Darabont and Co. have created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages on hope, perseverance, and friendship - and it does it with marvelous eloquency. All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art. Perfect."	10
 Hope!!!	"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!"	10
 A gritty look at prison. One of the best prison movies ever.	This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.4 stars out of 4	10
 Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies.		
 This should be in everyone's permanent collection.		10
 This movie is for every man	There are few movies that capture and identify with the American male spirit. Shawshank is one of those movies. I don't care what anyone's take is on prison treatment or whether you are conservative or liberal, this movie is moving. There are three movies, in my opinion, that every man, or developing man, should watch: Shawshank Redemption, Dancing With Wolves, and Brave Heart. Unless you are a total pansy, these are the movies that will confirm your heterosexuality. Andy Dufrane is the person in us. Red is the person we want to be. Aside from the being in prison, the job they have is well apt to the people of this great nation.	10
 Redemption	"This movie is poetry. For those of you who've ever felt the way poetry rolls off of the tongue, you'll understand what I mean when I say this.The first thing that makes this movie great is Morgan Freeman's ability to narrate the way he does. His soft, yet ruff voice provides the audience with the belief that this man has endured many years of hardships and has gained wisdom and experience through trial and error. He is a natural story teller, so his ability as a narrator is natural and smooth; not forced, like so many other actors.Tim Robbins displays his acting ability beautifully and captures the audience with an intense amount of emotion, which seems to resonate in his eyes. The genius and wisdom of the character he portrays is a fascinating thing to watch unfold, as the story lays itself out, like a poster of Rita Hayworth.To say that this movie gives the audience hope would be unfair because this movie makes the audience want to live, love, experience life for all of its pleasures and its faults. It makes one appreciate the simple things and slow down a bit, to admire that which we pass a hundred times a day, but never truly see.To describe this movie as ""great"" would be an understatement because it is so much more than that. While it is brutal and realistic, it portrays humanity at our best and our worst, providing the audience with a mirror in which to reflect what lies within. By the time the credits roll, we're left speechless...and at the same time, wanting to share this masterpiece with those we love and cherish.Everyone should see this movie at least once in a lifetime to make us appreciate everything we have. Who would have thought someone could capture humanity this way? I guess a picture really is worth a thousand words......"	10
 A Sort of Secular Redemption		9
 One of my favourites...		10
 Hope Springs Eternal:Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption.	"After just seeing this,i have to say i think its one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.And one of the few films that can be called a ""moden classic"". The Plot:After the police in Maine find the bodies of a married woman and her lover,who were shot eight times.They bring in the married woman's husband.A hot-shot banker Andy Dufren(Tim""The Mystic River"" Robbins) .Who clams that he is not guilty.At the end of the case,Andy is found guilty and given two life sentences at Shawshank prison Maine.When he is first there he is very closed off from everyone.And has fights with a prison group called ""The Sisters"".Until he tells a guard how to keep money from a will.While in there,he gets the trust of the guards and the warden and builds a strong friendship with a black marketeer named Red(played fantastically by Morgan""The Dreamcatcher,The Se7ven""Freeman).Things are going well,till an inmate Tommy,tells Andy,that in a prison he was in,he met the man who did the murder Andys in Shawshank for.The warden,who thinks Tommy is to much of a risk for his money business due to Andy doing all work for him),so he kills Tommy.After this,Andy decides its time he gets out of Shawshank.View on the film:The cast. This is one of the rare films,where all the cast just click into there roles.The two leads Robbins and Freeman,who give some of there best work in this film.The way they work and build there friendship in the film,that is sadly rarely seen in any movies.The supporting characters in the film do a really good job at standing out and not feeling like they are just card-board cut outs.The main one in the supporting cast that stand out is James Whitmore as Brooks.who makes a very enjoyable characters,who you feel very sad,to see go out in a very sad way.The Screenply/Direction.Wirter/director Frank""The Green Mile"" Darabont (who made a student-film based on a King short story:The Woman in the Red Room),does a screenplay that easily improves on the short story.While Kings short story spent (i feel) a bit to much time on the exposition in his story,while Darabont makes sure to keep the set-up going at a good pace,and to tighten some of the story lines(Brooks was hardly in the short story,Tommy was not killed).But he makes sure to keep the feel of the story so they do not feel as strange add-ons to the story.The direction the Darabont does is to make sure to see the actors work build in the scenes,while doing a good job at keeping the film going at a pace that does not feel over-long (something that is rare with movies now). Final view on the film:A movie anyone can enjoy,from age 18-80!"	10
 The best movie ever!	"Even though this movie is over 10 years old, the message about friendship and not ever giving up will be relevant forever. The lessons that the main characters teach us in the face of adversity are timeless. This is also one movie that does not get old, and I have watched ""Shawshank"" many times. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were spectacular in their performances. They teach lessons that are extremely memorable and have quotes that you will never forget. The one quote in the film that is a stand-out is, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"". Who would not feel the impact of that quote? This is one movie you have to have in your library, and I am not one that usually buys DVD's. This is a MUST SEE!!!! Don't miss this one, and also keep a box of tissues nearby."	10
 great film	I can watch this film a hundred times and still enjoy it. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. And this must be his best roll ever. I thought Tim Robbins was definitely at his best in this film. All the prison guards and inmates were really believable. The story captures you from the beginning and doesn't let go until the final credits are rolled. This is the kind of film that make you think of how many inequities must exist in our prison system that no one ever hears about. Of all the the movies of this type the Shawshank Redemtion brings to light how good and evil can exist in every situation. And that nothing is black and white. But until it effect you its out of sight and out of mind.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever seen		10
 Credit where credit is due.		10
 A Masterpiece	"For it's subtlety, it's intelligence, and it's gorgeous cinematography (often overlooked in this film), this is one of the finest films ever made. Robbins and Freeman are brilliant. The rest of the cast flows through the storyline with a poise and cadence that is flawless. The story itself is based on a short work by Stephen King, but the screenplay is sculpted perfectly and gently into a full-length film by Frank Darabont. A powerful story of one man's journey through a punishment he did not deserve, and ""redemption"" of soul that lifts the hearts of viewers. It reminds us that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things"". Gentle and supremely smart."	10
 Incredibly moving, funny and haunting		10
 One of the Greatest Ever	After watching this movie i was stunned at how great it was. It was the first movie that kept me hooked the whole way through and had everything in it. What made it better was seeing how it was expanded so well from the original short story, which again was very good. How anyone can say it less, must not have been watching it properly. There is nothing to say to criticise the movie, the acting was brilliant, the casting great, and the directing, breath taking. But we can not overlook the great writer who brought this story to life, Steven King. Without having writers like him, we would never have any movies to match up to the likes of Shawshank and Godfather. I am still waiting for another movie to knock it off the top of my top 10 list, however, i am doubtful if this will ever happen.	10
 A kind-hearted masterpiece of friendship...	"This majestic movie is about Andy (Tim Robbins), a banker wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover after discovering she had been cheating on him. He gets impounded with two life sentences in the Shawshank Prison. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) who befriends him, and as the story moves along slowly, he eventually understands what Andy once told him: ""Get busy living, or get busy dying.""Andy is persistent in his quest to be free. And he tries to convince Red during the entire course of the movie that hope is indeed a good thing, even in a prison like Shawshank. In his endeavor, Andy will come face to face with the warden, who is truly a manifestation of greed itself. Many challenges will test his mettle.This piece of art is not to be missed; it is one of the greatest works of modern drama. And the slow pace of the movie only helps further to sink you in its mood, and leave you satisfied with a strange bitter sweet feeling in the end."	10
 One of my TOP TEN		10
 Hope is everything	"This movie surprised me so much I watched it twice in one day the first time I saw it. Sure I hadn't just picked a movie at random, at the local DVD-shop, but I didn't expect it to be so good. After I watched it I had a look on the IMDb website and was surprised once again that i found it placed number 2 on the top 250 movies list. I wondered to myself, why didn't I know about this movie. Afterall Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are quite well-known actors. Frank Darabont however only just caught my attention in 1999, when 'the Green Mile' was released. Finally I came to the conclusion that it must have been either television, because it surely isn't on television often enough, or it could just be me, not knowing very much about the film-world before 1995. For in fact, everyone in my school seemed to have known 'the Shawshank Redemption' for a very long time. ""One of the best movies ever"", my best friend said, ""My favorite movie in the whole wide world"", another one of my friends. THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME!!!! I replied. If you liked 'the Green Mile', I'm telling you now, you'll love this!!!"	10
 One of the Best If You Get It		9
 Extraordinary	An analysis of prison life--and of what hope can be in a prison--Frank Darabont's first film is one of the best ever.  Well-written and well-acted, the story of the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming, endearing, poignant.  Nothing about this movie is overwrought or extraneous--it's simply extraordinary drama.	10
 A movie worth seeing again and again.	"This movie is one of the few movies that I love to see over and over again. Each time I see it, I learn more and more.  Like figuring out the joke about ""salvation lies within.""  I also learned that the movie is more about Red than it is about Andy.  It is as if Andy was sent there by God to give Red hope and to bring good to what was evil within.  This movie has everything a movie needs.  It makes you laugh, cry, and feel really good, giving you a feeling of hope."	10
 As succinct as I can be		10
 Interpersonal Communication Use	"I use this movie in my Interpersonal Communication course.  The relationship between Red and Andy provides rich examples for my students to look for as they write on important issues of Interpersonal Communication such as the symbolic nature of language, powerful and powerless speech, posture, intimate and social distances, territory, chronemics, various types of listening, and self disclosure.  Many ""young"" students struggle to relate ""in-class/in-text"" examples to their own lives, and I use this movie to give the class a common experience to discuss and better understand the foundational elements of Interpersonal Communication.  ALWAYS a good experience for my students!"	
 #1 ? SERIOUSLY ??	This is a normal average movie . People are just hyped because it is in #1 . And I don't think those people have seen a lot of movies . It's way too much overrated in my opinion . My honest rating would be 7/10	7
 #1 on IMDB's top 250, one of the best movies of all time and more than 6200 reviews... what's more to say about this movie?		10

 IMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time	Two imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.Is this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.And it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.	10
 best movie ever	this film is an award winning achievement i loved it what a fantastic and brilliant together drama and crime movie really really amazing a must see to everyone.the story is about a guy called Andy Dufresne who was sent to prison for a murder that was committed to his wife and Andy goes through prison with hard times and a friend for his time in the shaw shank prison with brilliant ac tining from Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman and Clancy brown throughout the film Tim Robbins was Andy Morgan freeman red and Clancy brown as the guard.overall the whole truth can not be told u will love this film don't spoil this for your self its a brilliant story with friendship and survival 10/10 you must get this on DVD trust me its brilliant	10
 hope is a good thing,, and good things never,,,,,		10
 To be seen once every 6 months, for complete revitalisation of Mind and Soul	Like a beautifully crafted French wine, this movie keeps getting better and better with every passing year. Every time I have viewed it over the past decade (and it must be at least more than 20 times by now), I have found newer shades, subtler indications, and deeper meanings. And it has amazed me like very few have.* No overacting * Humour in the drab hopeless environs of Shawshank * Method in the madness of running the scams from inside * The complete secrecy maintained for 20 years (not even Red knew!) * The best that a highly-educated intellectual could do inside such a prison * What a great actor the Warden turned out to be - totally despicable! * What a bunch of speakable quotes.. what a bunch! * Totally recommended for any young person - students especially * HOPE TRULY IS THE BEST OF THINGS - a message that shines through	10
 Best movie ever		10
 A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ...		10
 An excellent film contained within a classic		10
" ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"""	I have grown up watching Bollywood movies, full of overacting by overpaid, overfed 'heroes'. It was in college that i got to see some fine Hollywood films and this one was probably the finest of the lot. This film at first appears to be a story about life in prison. It fully describes every small experience of a person serving a long prison sentence. Life is not easy there for a lot of reasons. The screenplay is ably supported by Morgan Freeman's brilliant narration offering a second-person view of life in shawshank. But Tim Robbins steals the show by aptly underplaying the part of a wrongly sentenced, wealthy banker.The last forty minutes of this film, however, help raise it a couple of levels above other cinematic masterpieces. You don't need a weapon to fight. It is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.	10
 Redemptive Masterpiece; Masterful Redemption		10
 A fantastic story which touches the inner-most of the body		10
 Best film I have ever seen	I don't write film reviews normally, but this is no normal film. i never tire of watching the Shawshank redemption not because of its sheer brilliance but because of all the intertwining emotions portrayed by the characters.The film begins slowly but Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) has a strange, intriguing style unfamiliar with that of a normal inmate jailed for 2 life sentences. As the film progresses it's almost like you know the characters and you're part of the gang with Andy and Red. you feel andy's tenacity as he battles for whats right. As you begin to relate to Andy's feelings you are reminded why he is there: found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover. So when the 'new boy' clears his name there is a huge relief, almost like a maternal feeling of 'i knew it' As the film builds towards the end you cannot know what is about to happen and when it does.... wow; brilliant ending. brilliant film	9
 Very powerful	"I feel sorry for all of you , guys/girls who rated this as 1 star (awful). I really do not think you could consider this as the worst or one of the worst movies you have ever seen. Maybe it is overrated, maybe not , but STOP trying to lower its position in the Top 250. This is supposed to be a USER RATING , so if you loved it , give it a 10 , if for you it is an average movie , give it a 5. I read some comments about this one , and heard someone saying : "" ... it is a good movie, deserves 6 or 7 stars , but i gave it 1 star because I think it is very overrated ... "" That's so pathetic ...Once again , STOP doing this and rate the movie as you liked it !"	9
 Must watch movie!!!!		10
 #2086		10
 phenomenal Film 11 out of 10		10
 An epic movie of pure brilliance!	This film is a truly awesome film once i had started watching the first 10 minutes of it i was addicted to the TV and could do nothing but to watch it. This story is about a respectable banker (Andy Duframe) who is sentenced to Shawshank prison for life imprisonment for a crime he did not commit. Once he arrives at Shawshank he soon starts to learn that the prison mentally takes your life. However, Andy seems very unusual being very quite and polite around the prison. At the spectacular climax at the end of this film it just gives the viewer such an amazing feeling of hope and in my opinion this is the best film every made. A must watch film!!! 10/10	10
 Shamelessly uplifting; a heartfelt classic		10
 Fantastic...	The Shawshank Redemption has you hooked from the very first scene. Although Andy's innocence was obvious from the beginning, you just think how he's going to get out of it.For me, the power and depth in this movie was it's ability to make prison life and friendships look better than that on the outside. Also when they were finally released they were so hesitant to live on the outside and wanted to go back in. I'm not sure why this affected me so much but i think it's just the fact that one mistake forced these people to live in a certain way where they don't want so much freedom and they're used to being workers with no rewards. They just couldn't adapt to the outside world. As if it were a different planet or something.Although the men are supposed to be 'cold hearted killers', they seem so nice and are so easy to sympathise with. I know it sounds lame to feel sorry for a killer or thief but i think that the amazing story and acting, had me hoping that all of the prisoners were innocent... except for some obviously. Not to mention the guards were so mean and rude i just wished they would all get punished and tortured at the end of the movie.If someone can feel that passionate and involved in a movie the first time they've seen it...i think it's a sign that if the person reading this still hasn't...they should. The Shawshank Redemption most definitely deserves its spot on the IMDb top #250.	9
 When they give you life, that's what they take		9
 If I could've rated the movie 20 out of 10, I would've done so!!!	I have never commented on a film but living as movie lover, a great movie lover, I've always been seeking for finest fine movies, movies that can't be forgotten, that would give a meaning to me... The Shawshank Redemption, it is a movie that I can't say anything about it else than powerful, well-made and meaningful to me, as God as my witness, to this moment I haven't seen any movie better than that ... It was recommended by a dear friend of mine but I never took seriously until I watched the first thirty minutes of it, then I regretted that I've never attempted to watch it before that moment Hope, something good never dies, I have hope that I believe in, and I believe that someday that hope will get me through life... The Shawshank Redemption, gives hope and that's enough for a movie... I don't have that great knowledge of movie, but I do believe that this is one of the finest movies that were ever made...	10
 Must See film of 90's	"This is the #1. Absolute must see film of the 1990s, Our Generation, anyone's lifetime and quite possibly the history of film. Hope and perseverance are front and center as themes in this blockbuster. Anyone of any age any race either sex and any religion should see this and I promise you'll wish to share it with everyone you know. Don't think ""another Prison Movie"" about-this one, it's above and beyond that cliché. Expect career performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, and James Whitmore. Along side many outstanding character performances from the supporting cast. I Cannot emphasize-the importance of this film. I personally thank Everyone involved in producing such an enormous telling of Steven Kings masterpiece. It has become a source of daily inspiration for me and I continue to watch it Several times a year to this day. thank you."	10
 what a great movie!	in my opinion ,it's better than the ordinary Monte Cristo story that we all know as the greatest escape tale , so this time the escape is greater! and the hero is an ordinary man , who is so patient and hopeful, while you watch the first few minutes of the film you may think that it's social or silly story, but minute by minute you will recognize that you were wrong, it's a Brilliant Story,a never seen before , a very powerful drama .. the best thing in that movie was the relations between characters,like hating,and true friendship like the one which was between Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman,I like this movie and i advice every one on the planet to watch it as soon as possible....	10
 A beautifully crafted tale that underlines subjects that have been forgotten in modern films- friendship,hope, freedom		10
 Graceful, intriguing Tim Robbins triumph	The Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10.	9
 What else can you say?	In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!	10
 A true tale of hope and friendship (contains spoiler)	I didn't see the film in the cinema, because I was too young at 14, though when I did rent it on video, and subsequently DVD, it was and is still to this day the best movie I have ever hired out, and Now I have the DVD with all the extras it makes a truly memorable film that much complete. It's true what they say about this having an impact on people's lives as it did me. From the moment it starts and you start to hear the narration of Morgan Freeman you know there is something special to this film.The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.There are two best scenes for me most powerful is Reds 3rd parole hearing it sums up total acceptance of what he's done and he can be open to them about how he truly feels without a care or worry in the world. The second is when Red finds the Box under the Oak Tree and the whole story seems to come together at that point. The way time progresses is an essential aspect in this film and that's another excellent example you see of Andy and the Warden almost becoming partners in crime and they develop this close bond. Prison Drama? No that description doesn't give this film justice it's a pure masterpiece and if you haven't seen it I would advise buy a copy now you won't be disappointed. Even after 50 or so viewings I still get a lump in throat.	10
 First 10 I have ever given out		10
 Don't Watch This Movie!! (Unless you want to Cry)		10
 Please see it and feel its magic.	This is without a doubt my favorite movie. Every time I see this movie I feel touched by its magic. Most of my friends have seen it because I have recommended them to do it and they have all loved it.Robbins, Freeman and Whitmore's characters are the ones that I like the most.It is just stupid, unfair and shameful that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes. The IMBD voters have it at #2. My hope is to see it in the future at #1.	10
 AN EXCELLENT MASTERPIECE !!	Great music, superb actors. It is a pity that Forrest Gump (which I consider another masterpiece ) went out the same year and got all the publicity, as well as the Oscars. It was not fair.The only reason for which I rented this movie, two years ago, was because of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. But it was a big surprise to see one of the best films ever made. ( I have seen it 6 more times since then )It is a story of COURAGE, PERSEVERANCE, TRUE FRIENDSHIP, HOPE AND REDEMPTION.IT'S A MOVIE FOR ALL TIMES, A MEMORABLE ONE. EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE IT. YOÚ WON'T REGRET.	10
 Absolutely brilliant	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the few movies adapted from books that turned out to be good .. or in, this case, brilliant.Although the movie supposedly takes place somewhen in the 1950's, I can easily imagine it being transferred to today's time and standards. The thing that is most fascinating about is is that the directors [and writers, of course] didn't use extreme clichés - there's no black and white painting, just numerous shades of grey. Robbins and Freeman both are perfect for their roles, as are all of the supporting actors.Finally, I can understand why a certain movies gets a high ranking.	10
 Wow!!!Amazing!!!Breathtaking!!!	The first time I saw this film I said those three words a lot to my friends and family. Shawshank Redemption is the BEST FILM I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have seen tons of films. Morgan Freeman gave a performance that will touch anyone's heart. From beginning to end this film shows how films should be made.	10

 A Bit Over-Rated Perhaps, But Still A Good Movie With Great Performances From Freeman and Robbins	"Deliberately (some might even say slowly in places) paced, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" alternates between offering a grittily realistic portrayal of life in prison and flights of fancy that make the story too unbelievable to really be accepted. There is an interesting subplot (which doesn't take up much of the movie but which does make the viewer ponder) about the difficulties of adjusting to life in the real world after extended periods of incarceration. The performances from the two leads are excellent. Morgan Freeman puts on his usual outstanding performance as ""Red"" - the wise old con through whose eyes the story is told, and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresnce, a young banker wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover who has to adjust to the nightmare of prison life. Among the supporting cast I was impressed with Bob Gunton as the Bible-spouting but corrupt Warden Norton, who uses Andy's financial expertise to enrich himself, and James Whitmore as Brooks, imprisoned for fifty years and terrified when he is finally granted parole and who, unable to adjust to life on the outside, yearns only to be back in the only home he ever knew - prison. It's an interesting twist - experience also by Red later on in the movie - that freedom can seem to be like a prison for those so accustomed to the regimentation of life in an institution.While the movie is impressive and engrossing all the way through, though, there are some weaknesses to the story that bothered me a bit. (There are some spoilers ahead.)I found it difficult to imagine prison guards from all over the State of Maine bringing their tax returns to Andy. It just didn't seem to me like something that would have happened. It also struck me as unlikely that a letter-writing campaign from one solitary prisoner (even one that lasted six years, one letter a week) would have convinced the State to fund the improvements Andy got for the prison library. I would rather expect that after a while the letters would simply start to be discarded. Andy's escape also bothered me. It was too ""easy"" - even though it took twenty years. And how did he keep that suit so spotless and unwrinkled while crawling through that dirty sewer? Mind you, the moments leading up to the discovery of his escape were among the most dramatic in the movie. The very end of the story was also clearly telegraphed some time before.Frankly speaking, I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a bit over-rated here at IMDb, being ranked the second best movie of all time, but this is still a very, very good movie, and an excellent portrayal (through Andy) of the survival of the human spirit in even the toughest times. Personally, I give it a 7/10."	7
" Tedious, overlong, with ""hope"" being the second word spoken in just about every sentence... who cares?"		5
 Stephen King's prison tale with a happy ending...		7
 The Shawshank BESTemption	The best movie I've ever seen. I've seen her more than twenty times and it's always perfect. On the 10th year anniversary DVD edition Frank Darabont claims that the movie has helped people through divorces and losing love ones and so on, just see the movie and you'll understand why.The scene were Andy Dufresne finally gets out of Shawshank and he's standing in the rain and raising his hands is one of the better scenes in the movie history. I've got that poster up on my wall. It's amazing how you feel brightened when you see that particular scene.Try seeing the movie a couple of times, and then reading the book which is written by Steven King, and then seeing the movie again. It pushes the movie up to another level and you'll like it more thereafter.	10

 Easy-breezy, obvious as a child's lie.	"Shawshank Redemption (1994)The short of it: I asked some students what their favorite movie was, and some of them (many of them) said, ""Shawshank Redemption,"" and I said, ""I haven't even seen it."" And they assigned it to me as homework. I started watching, and after about twenty minutes I realized I had, in fact, seen it before.That's how memorable it was for me.I also see that Shawshank has the highest user rating of any film on IMDb. What do these other intelligent, movieloving people see that I don't? I wish I could know, but I can't except by reading their comments. And here, then, finally, is mine.First of all, I don't think it's a terrible film, despite all the picking I do. I'm trying to be analytical. But when I take one aspect and think about it independently, and compare it to other movies I like, it starts to look weak for specific reasons, which is good to know. Please don't read further if you just want a confirmation of why this is a great film. In brief, I don't think Shawshank probes, invents, or seduces aesthetically. It's just a nice story well told.First, that story. Stephen King is a successful writer, to say the least, and a really good ""wordsmith."" His stories work with simple conflicts, and they are plot driven--one thing happens, another thing happens, a third thing is almost necessary to have happen, a twist, a turn, and always, from what I can tell, a nice wrap up. That's pretty much the plot in Shawshank. There is almost no depth to the characters--they are stereotypes, not made of foamcore maybe, but flimsy. There is the evil warden, of course. There is the thoughtful black man who everyone likes, played by Morgan Freeman (who narrates), and the thoughtful white man who doesn't like anyone (at first), played by Tim Robbins.Of course, it goes from there, but really, the ""twists"" are old ones. The plot is the framework for something I found more irritating, and that was a slightly glib tone. The story was not really ""realistic"" in any sense, though the trappings of actual prison life are all there, from rape in the back room to corruption in the front office. Maybe as a ""fable"" it can get away with its airiness, right up to the final happy ending. It might not need any grounding in reality. As a fable it would naturally avoid complexity, or even anything independently interesting. What I mean is, maybe the journey through these familiar clichés, done with a fuzzy, congenial ease, is self-satisfying on purpose. And therefore Shawshank Redemption is heartwarming and enjoyable, to use two words that are as exciting together as milk and warm.But it was this breezy tone that made it unwatchable for me. I had to fastforward through a few parts in the second half (it was my second time seeing it). It seemed that nothing happening! Nothing I hadn't seen before in other movies. It struck me not as mythic or spiritual (those are words people use) but as false, as anti-meaningful because it's obvious, familiar, comforting.The film-making? Let's tick off some basics. Editing: conventional, and downright slow. You can argue the pace was leisurely and luxurious to draw the viewer in. Or you can say it's drawn out and sluggish.Music: functional and familiar, ""movie music"" pure and simple, in its lush seduction, which is offputting once you pay attention to it directly.Script: hmmmm. The writing is not distracting or ""bad"" especially, but that's hardly a recommendation. It gets the information across. But really, read some lines, repeat a few scenes out loud. There are those now famous lines, about everyone being innocent and so on, but most of the movie doesn't crackle--even other Hollywood heartwarmers like Die Hard have more inventiveness. Isn't Shawshank presenting Hallmark sentiments?Acting: exactly what the film needed for its pace and intentions. No faulting Freeman or Robbins there.Photography: professional. If there was a movie crying out for some great filming, this is one, with a great interior to exploit and some good night scenes. But the camera work is functional, with a few moments of higher drama (the prisoner getting shot from above, the escape sequence). But look how often the scenes are just filmed ""nicely"" so that we enjoy being there. Maybe this is the idea, to be caressed and not assaulted--it's not an action adventure film, so I don't expect to be shocked. Direction: finally, the lynchpin person here needs to be accountable. Oh, I'm sure Frank Darabont doesn't mind the cult status of his movie, but he probably knows he is no auteur, but rather rode the coattails of a lot of talented craftspeople around him. But those other people all had to count on him to ask for (and deliver) something with more originality, beauty, surprise, depth, and compactness than the Shawshank we have. It's not a shame, obviously, that we have what we have, because so many people love it, really really love it. I didn't care for his other well known film either, The Green Mile, and so again, it's just what you want from your two hours of absorption.But it brings me back to where I started, which is to realize that there are all kinds of viewers, and movies to match. This one didn't go the places I need a great movie to go. It's not a bad movie, not at all. In fact, this might be a classic example of a movie being much more than the sum of its parts. But, still, even the whole strikes me as flip and easy-breezy, obvious as child's lie. It is content to be superficial, and I, personally, am not."	7
 Mediocre people reward mediocre cinema.	"It bugs me that this movie is rated so high- not because it's a ""bad"" movie, but because it's a mediocre one. Apparently, mediocre people reward mediocre cinema. This movie tanked big-time when it was initially released, and with good reason. It wasn't until pseudo-intellectuals across the country started hyping it as defacto ""favorite movie"" for Lowbrows world-wide that it started dominating the IMDb ""best movie"" list. In reality, ""Shawshank"" is like a sewage pump for every idiotic Prison Movie cliché ever made. Every guard is a monster. The warden is religious, therefore Evil. Not a single prisoner is actually guilty, or if they are, they're so obviously redeemed that we're supposed to feel sorry for their unfair imprisonment. Murderers and sex offenders sit around in beatific awe as Opera plays over the loudspeakers. Right. The whole movie is so fake, so smarmy, and so condescending that it's no wonder that so many Americans, (with their odd addiction to fake, smarmy, condescending things) consider it their ""favorite movie"". I guess thinking for yourself is a burden to great for some of us to bear."	1
 Decent film, highly overrated		5
 Not		4
 Long and saccharine	This bloated and soggy piece of work is so far from earning a number 2 spot on the IMDb that I have to imagine that Stephen King has bought votes for it. Trite , mawkish, shallow, unconvincing, ugly... How much more can I say about its awfulness? Morgan Freeman is tolerable, Tim Robbins is not. There is a romantic glow to the cinematography that is really inappropriate if the main characters are heterosexual. If they aren't there is an unexplored subtext poisoning the base of the movie. There is nothing else about this movie that makes a lick of sense: emotional, dramatic, logical, racial, penological. Rips off the Count of Monte Cristo and Huckleberry Finn and cheapens and flattens them. Its appeal escapes me utterly. For the love of God, sink this film!	4
 Overrated and overthought	The movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen, but to be honest, the movie is also greatly overrated in many ways. I believe that the reason the movie is so popular is because of the huge wave of popularity towards voting it up. As the movie portrays the continuous struggle for the main character, Andy Dufresne, you are in suspense, and locked by the question whether he did it or not. And even though he keeps doing good and honorable thing for the guards and his fellow inmates. There was in my experience not a moment before he escaped where you are absolutely certain that he did not do it. This is the thing that captivates a lot of people i think, and i follow this aspect, and i understand it. But even though this movie, in my opinion does not have any flaws, it is still not perfect, and i do not think that it is the best, not flawed feature film ever made.	8
 A Contrarian View		
 Three tales of hope	I think that the Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Personally, I think that Forrest Gump (FG) is also a tale of Hope, but in a different sense. Firstly, FG shows the hope of waiting for the woman you love for over 20 years. Secondly, FG shows that there can be hope for mentally disabled people to continue in society and aim for goals. I think that both movies are great and should not be missed or inappropiately criticised. I also urge people to watch La Vita e bella (Life is beautiful) as it is as good as The Shawshank Redemption and has some similar points. May we all hope for more movies like these.PS Also watch It's a Wonderful Life (James Stewart) as this is about hope as well.	10
 One of the best prison dramas ever	This was a very good movie.  Robbins and Freeman are Terrific.  It was a very moving movie.  I would strongly recommend this movie.	9
 absurdly overrated	"This movie is absurdly overrated by people who think soppy affirmative moviemaking accompanied by a lush score is synonymous with aesthetic brilliance.    The direction is nothing to write home about, the cinematography is, frankly, standard.  The script has Steven King written all over it - a melodramatic plot involving the woes of an educated bloke told in overwrought dialogue full of clumsy metaphors.  (A good example: the moment when the scriptwriter decided that the prisoner's interest in geology had to be spelled out for the dumber members of the audience ""It's all about TIME and PRESSURE..."" just in case anyone managed to miss the connection). Morgan Freeman is, as usual, superb but Tim Robbins is inconsistent as a man who goes from being the gaol newcomer to an old hand.  While the film's sympathetic liberal political stance can be commended, it's certainly not a great work of art."	3
 Sure it's good, but no. 2 of all time???	Sure it was a good prison movie, and much better than many other movies I've seen.  But this does NOT beat Godfather, Star Wars, or Casablanca in any way.  Watch this if you enjoy good performances and good plot, but don't expect a present-day classic ala Forrest Gump.	7
 A genre picture, but a satisfying one...	"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three-dimensional characterizations. The finale is pure fantasy, however it does provide the audience with the release it needs, and Robbins and Freeman are excellent. Long, involved, but engrossing and satisfying, ""Shawshank"" was not a big hit at the box-office but found a devoted following on video and cable. **1/2 from ****"	6
 Why? Why? Why?	I just don't get it. It's not that I think this is an awful movie or anything, but no.2? Look at the rest of the movies in the top 10. Does it REALLY stand comparison with the Godfather or Seven Samurai? I think not. It's a manipulative, sentimental Sunday afternoon movie, raised above B-standard by some quality turns by talented actors. Nothing more. And who cares whether Andy could put the poster back in place or not. It's a patently ridiculous 'escape' to begin with. I understand that most of the people on this site will have a pop at me for being a snob, but the fact is I love Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and other 'blockbuster' movies. But if you're looking for a genuinely affecting drama, this doesn't cut the mustard. Sorry, guys, but you're all wrong.	7
 The movie that wouldn't end	"Ok.  It wasn't that bad.  In fact, there's a lot to like about this movie. But there was absolutely no reason why this movie needed to go on and on and on and on.Excellent acting of course:  Freeman is always right on target and Tim Robbins is very good (although I happen to dislike his political views and that inhibits my ability to imagine he's anyone else but Robbins up there on the screen).Its a movie that makes one think about the important things in life, and it does that without being preachy.However, I don't like the way it uses cliches all the way through, i.e. the bad warden who is a pseudo-Christian.  Hollywood has shown much hatred towards Christianity,  and this is only one more movie in a long string which tries to make Christians look bad.****spoilers ahead********Also, it is simply not believable that (a) the prison would not have moved Andy in 19 years of prison life, and (b) the sound of his rock scraping wouldn't have been heard and (c) he wouldn't have been seen ""underneath"" the poster, working away at the wall.I find it hard to believe furthermore, that Andy would go back into the town where he proposed, just to leave money under that rock.  An escaped convict would not want to be anywhere near where people may recognize him, if he had any smarts, which Andy did.But those things alone did not prevent me from enjoying the movie, I just don't think the movie lived up to its hype, and I would feel no need to ever watch it again (and I always watch my favs over and over again!)."	
 Papillion is much better	Oh come on 2nd best movie ever, I don't think so.  It's unrealistic and overly sentimental, the people who voted so high can't have seen many films. By all means watch it, but Papillion for example, is far superior, who can forget Steve McQueen's red rimmed eyes and pasty face as he catches bugs, and crushes centipedes into his watery broth to get nourishment in that incredible portrayal of hardship and determination.  I wouldn't put Papillion as the 2nd best film of all time, but it has to be the best Prison drama.  Watch Shawshank and you'll enjoy it as a lightweight entertaining feel good movie, but there are so many classic films better than this.	5
 I thought there were supposed to be no fairytales?	"!!Spoilers to this movie, as well as to Sixth Sense and Citizen Kane just for spite!!Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that oozes with ""give me an Oscar pleeeeeease"" all over it. You know the type  - like ""Dances with Wolves."" Oversentimental and overlong. It's surprising that this movie has such a high imdb ranking considering it's such a very black and white (prisoners=good, prison-keepers=evil) movie rehashing what's been hashed and hashed many times.The story concerns an apparently-wrongly-convicted banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to life at Shawshank Prison in that creepiest of states, Maine, for murdering his wife and her lover. His main 'friend' at Shawshank is wily old-time-prisoner named Red (Morgan Freeman). Nobody can deny that Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors ever, and I'm not going to. Tim Robbins also gives a performance that one wouldn't guess he had in him by watching, say, ""Nothing to Lose"" (which nevertheless is a better movie). And the supporting cast is all excellent in roles that are incredibly one-dimensional. Okay, that's it for the good. Here comes the bad, and the ugly.Early on in the film, Red, who doubles as the narrator, tells us that although he'd like to tell us Andy wasn't gang-raped by some of the fellow inmates (the only bad inmates in there, by the way, and then they get sent away, so that leaves only good ones) but he can't, cause ""that'd be a fairytale.  And there are no fairytales here at Shawshank."" How wrong he is! The whole movie is a fairytale (albeit without any of the excitement and fast-pace of one).We get characters who are so completely good as to be Saints for our two main prisoners (and most of the other ones) and the Prison guards and warden who all seem to be variations on the evil stepmother from Cinderella and the evil stepmother from Snow White (heck, they're so evil, their intramural baseball team's name is the Marauders. Gee, I wonder if you people get the hidden message?).The story itself is about two-and-a-half hours of sadism (very slow-paced sadism, mind you), an hour of philosophical jabbering that, frankly, is far inferior to a philosophy class at the college if you're into that sort of thing (Hope is Good? Oh my God! What a revelation! Tell me more! Honestly, I've heard songs which have more depth than this movie!) And half an hour of the ending.It's hard to talk about the faults of the movie without giving away the ending, because, the ending itself is one of the main ones. All good movies have an ending that makes you think (or at least are somewhat open to interpretation, and/or sequels). But not this one. Although I counted at least five or six points where the movie could have ended with leaving some room for thought, it follows through to the bitter predictable end. It's as if it's saying ""you know what, you viewers are all idiots, we better not let you think about anything at all."" Even if that was true, it's quite insulting.  What's more is the ending is incredibly predictable. How could it not be, if it's told to you in the title of the movie? I mean, imagine if the Sixth Sense was called ""The Dead Psychologist"" or Citizen Kane was called ""The Sled"" (sorry, imdb censorship guys, I know this makes your job harder, but I just can't think of a way to explain it otherwise).And I haven't even mentioned the worst part. This movie is incredibly long and boring. It's not a movie that is ""slow"" or ""moves at its own pace"" - those are alright by me. No, this movie, something is always happening, but not a single thing of interest. And like that for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But still.Another thing is this movie's already-mentioned assumed self-importance. It's irritating at the least. It's a long, boring, unoriginal version of what Cinderella would be if somebody traded in all the women characters for swearing, rape and police brutality. I mean, frankly, Charles Perrot beat you to it by four centuries, that's close to an all time record for unoriginality!"	3
 Saccharine	"Why do you like this so much? It steals directly from every other GOOD prison movie I've ever seen: The Great Escape, Escape from Alcatraz, Midnight Express, you name it. Because it allows the hero to be raped it's somehow brave or profound or heaven forbid realistic. Far from it folks. The work of hacks, only the MAIN performances are redeemable. How 'bout that warden, quite a 3 dimensional character that one. As are all the peripherals. Its bad, but in an average hollywood way. Of course it's overblown but it entertains decent enough in that much. Nothing memorable, infact I'd have forgotten it totally if it weren't for the persistant and oh so undeserved praise heaped upon it. But hey if it does it for you more power to you. Just don't talk about it's ""power"" in front of me, I may puke."	3
 Very unoriginal	I have a good friend that I can discuss movies with all day. Generally we have very similar tastes and critiques. Shawshank, is the only movie we completely disagree on. This movie insulted my intelligence from the first minute. All the prison clichés are painfully represented in this one film. The Innocent lead character, the benevolent inmate friend, the evil warden, the sadistic guard, etc.. Then of course you are mesmerized by the hackneyed subplots and obligatory scenes (i.e.) the attempted rape. About the only ingredient not thrown into this proverbial soup was a football game.This movie has some fine acting and direction, but considering its big name cast and production, the product is sophomoric at best.	3
 Overlong, Overblown and Over-rated		4
 Over rated	The Shawshank Redemption is with out a doubt one of the most over rated films of the 90s.  There have been many intriguing prison movies over the years, Shawshank is not one of them. Instead it's sentimental slop served to uplift the souls of the American people.  There is never any sense in the film that Tim Robbin's character is in true danger.  If the film wanted to show the true horror of prison maybe it should of been far more darker, instead of inspiration. Morgan Freeman is wasted as usual, in the role of wisdom spouting inmate. Freeman's character is mainly there to look wise and bring inspiration to us all, but he is never treated as a typical person. Tim Robbins is good, but his character is all good, while the prison warden is sure evil. Everything is black and white.  Shawshank has potential to be great, but director Frank Darabant's obsession with being Frank Capra ruins the film at every turn.	5
" An ""O.K."" Movie, Worshiped Because of It's Accessibility."		1
 Terrifyingly Overrated	"Shawshank is on TNT approximately five million times a year. It is the second-highest rated film on IMDb, and it was nominated for seven Oscars. It is a movie that can make grown men cry. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver great performances. Thomas Newman's original score is beautiful. It's an engaging film about perseverance, friendship, will power, and hope.But then again, does it really belong in the same company as Godfather, Godfather II, Schindler's List, and other consensus top-ten films? Is it really one of the ten best films of all time? First off, the villain of the film, Warden Norton, is an incredibly cartoonish, two dimensional bad guy. He and Cal from Titanic could have a ""pure-evil-for-the-sake-of-being-pure-evil"" standoff. Aside from greed, we have no idea what made him who he was. The Warden is pure evil, and is willing to kill the prisoner who can help prove Andy's innocence in cold blood. And yet, even though Andy is the one man who could expose him and all his criminal dealings, he doesn't do the simplest thing and just kill Andy. Why not? Because Andy has to wind up hugging Red on the beach years later.Secondly, think about the scene where Andy locks himself in a room and plays classical music over the loudspeakers to the rest of the prisoners, who stop in the courtyard and stare up in awe and wonder. Are you kidding me? The scene tries to be a powerful, emotional peak in the film, but it comes off as laughably implausible, even in the 1950's.Finally, the movie makes it a little too easy on the audience by giving it all the answers. Is Andy guilty? Does he really escape? Will he and Red ever meet up again? Nothing is left for the audience to wonder about, no ambiguity — everything is spoon-fed to the audience in tasty, happy-ending bites, right up to the final ""hug on the beach"" scene. Wait this movie ends with happy people hugging on a beach? Yes it does."	1
 Was I watching another movie?	The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that people either love or  well, hate is probably the wrong word.It's an OK film, but lacks in so many areas, most of all script and ideas. Yet again, we are subjected to an innocent man being sent to prison, governed by a sadistic guard and corrupt governor. Yet again, we see him get a glimmer of hope of release, and yet again we see hope destroyed.It's not exactly original.But, it is well filmed, and superbly acted. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played the lead roles to perfection. The surrounding parts were played as equally well, and none let the film down. Pity about the script.Don't get me started about the poster on the wall. All the searches, and no-one took it down? Oh, come on.Watch the film  yes, even enjoy it. But please don't think it's one of the best.	6
 Very good, but probably over-praised		7
 This movie worms its way into your soul.	"I have a friend who hasn't seen the Shawshank Redemption, and his comment was essentially this: ""I hate prison movies, and I hate religion movies, so I'm not gonna see a flick that has both aspects in it."" His loss. This movie, based on a Stephen King novella, is on my all-time top ten. Of course it has morals and many lessons we can learn, but bottom line, it is a great movie. Even though we know that Tim Robbins is innocent, he acknowledges his guilt on a more subtle level, his failure to be a good person. That he is in prison affords him the opportunity to become a ""good"" man for the first time in his life. He touches the soul of many inmates, in that he educates them in some of the finer things in life, namely, good music and great literature. (He corrects an inmate's pronunciation of Alexandre Dumas' last name from ""Dumbass"" to the correct ""Dumah"") The last quarter of the movie is spot-on great. We are always touched by redemption themes, just look at how popular ""Scrooge"" and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" have become over the years. Shawshank simply is too good to miss."	10
 Excellent Stephen King adaptation; flawless Robbins & Freeman	"THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION (1994) **** Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton,Clancy Brown, William Sadler, James Whitmore, Gil Bellows. Excellent adaptation of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" with falsely accused of murdering his wife Robbins facing hard time in a corrupt prison and a solid friend (Freeman in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated performance of stoicism). Great acting and above the preconceived ""prison film"" genre that also breaks away from the cliché of the human spirit yet enables its elements. Nominated for several Oscars including Best Picture, Screenplay Adaptation and Director."	
 unoriginal prison movie		1
 Why film beats books	"The Count of Monte Cristo isn't a very good book, and has spawned a few pretty poor films, but it's the ideas which make it an enduring story. Now whether Stephen King was consciously inspired by Dumas's (""Dumass's"") book when writing the original short story I don't know - what I do know is that Frank Darabont took a dour, typically coarsely-detailed potboiler and evolved it into something special. The big step for me, was that having taken an interesting idea and made it good, Darabont then found an ensemble cast and a cinematographer who could make it sing. I don't think there's a dull line of dialogue in the movie, and barely a camera shot either out of place or wasted. Why it is that equally talented filmmakers can spend millions and produce the kind of mindless gibberish which actually wins Oscars (like 'Braveheart' did in the year 'Shawshank Redemption' was nominated) I'll truly never fathom. Maybe there should be another way of formally recognising talent: wait ten years then take a vote - that way the mindless and the popular will have time to find their level and what's left is worth remembering."	10
 A great film, but #2?		8
 A prison drama starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.		10
 Worth watching, but not extraordinary	Some consider it a masterpiece, some just an example of experienced film-making. I'm sticking with the second opinion. I really do like The Shawshank Redemption, mainly because of its actors, but it remains a movie which pretends to tell a shocking story while using black-and-white schemes, unlikely characters (Andy Dufresne makes some saints look like amateurs) and incomplete character backgrounds. It is utterly unauthentic wherever you bother to question its settings or characters.A better prison movie should at least give the audience an idea of what rape, the loss of freedom, the loss of contact to your family and friends, bad conditions and dullness can really do to a person.I like the movie when it manages to show me how Brooks isn't able to adapt the outside world anymore. I find it mediocre when it tries to tell me the story of true friendship, strength and hope itself lying within a prison. I do not like it when it sells me men who manage to get through such hard times without developing any kind of trauma or negative characteristics.	7
 Nothing special	This is just a typical prison yarn with some mawkish sentimenttossed in. I really don' t understand the fuss. I guess some peoplelook for grandeur and prjoect it onto middling, palatable materiallike this. That's the only explanation I've got for the unwarrantedpopularity of this flick. Production credits are fine enough, as is theacting but it certainly doesn't belong on any repsectable list ofgreatest films of all time.	4
 2nd best film ever?	This movie is good, there's no question about that, but he 2nd best ever? That's a bit of a stretch. I can't really imagine that all of those people who gave this movie the 9 and 10 votes have seen very many other good movies.  Sure, the story is meaningful and it's harsh etc, but there are so many movies that are moving and powerful.  The fact that Shawshank is #2 on this list is a reflection of those voting.	7
 Overrated	"I cannot possibly realize why this movie is rated in top movies. There is nothing new in this film and there isn't anything in it that makes it special. Wake up people! Quote Bill Hicks ""Piece of Sh*t"".OK I'll give it that there isn't anything to complain about the acting or directing, etc. But this entire movie seems to be a compromise. I also think that the success of this film is based on the ""least worst principle"" and that makes it bad.I'm also fed up with the narrator and all the dramatic film music. All this seems like fishing Oscar nominations. Am I really the only one who can see how transparent this is? I doubt it so please vote movies that really will make difference."	5
 Mystifyingly adored piece of melodrama		4
 Are you serious??		
 absurd and so predictable	This movie is annoying in several ways.  The criminals are all goodhearted, thoughtful, sensitive guys while the guards and warden are the REAL bad guys.  gimme a break.  What is this?  Dukes of Hazard? (which was far better than this).  Further, the plot is so, so, so predicable.  Good guy outsmarts the bad guys and real justice is served. spare me.  I know, a lot of people love this flick, but in my humble opinion it is a big waste of time.	3
 A cute and sentimental prison drama?		7
 my backlash vote		1
 Cliche	"This film is nothing but one cliche after another. Having seen many of the 100's of prison films made from the early 30's to the 50's, I was able to pull almost every minute of Shawcrap from one of those films.While it is visually well made and acted, the story has every plot point of the ""standard"" prison film. They have the evil warden, innocent main character, friendly guilty guy, thugs and one good old prisoner. Don't waste your time on this one. Rent or buy some of the classic's of the prison genre."	1
 Overrated sappy drama	Little more than average drama for popular tastes. Predictable,  overly sentimental, and excessively long.It's a mystery to me that such a mediocre piece of cinematic art is at number 2 in the all time chart! However, predictably it's not in the top 100 more serious 'Sight and Sound'  critics and directors polls that are held every  ten years. Frank Darabont later proved to be no master with his two following films, the second rate 'The Green Mile' and the truly appalling 'The Majestic'. The fact that this pedestrian movie is, in this chart, ahead of the works of  real masters such as Kubrick, Welles, Kurosawa, Fellini and Hitchcock causes consternation.	6
 Escape from Shawshank		6
 Greatest movie ever made.	"The Shawshank Redemption offers a life lesson; that no matter what, hope must never be lost. Hope is a good thing. In addition, it shows the true benefits of friendship, of those that care for you.Andy Dufresne was sentenced to two life sentences for the murders of his wife and the ""fella she was banging."" Inside, he meets Red. Red will learn a lesson from Andy, that hope cannot be stripped from you, no matter what is done to you, no matter what happens, no matter how we suffer, hope will always be there to comfort us. Andy's education gets him benefits with the warden, who makes him his ""financial pet"" for his money laundering activities. He does not know however, that his world is going to come crashing down on him.This movie has had a very poignant and influential impact on myself. I do not get tired of seeing it, and every time I do, I feel like nothing in this world can hurt me. Only one word comes to my mind when describing the power and beauty of this movie. Perfect.Hope will set you free."	10
 Good but not great	Good acting from all concerned carries the rather simplistic and obvious storyline beyond the saccharine, but the villains are really predictable in their villany and the storyline, while initially moving and affecting, seems forced and unreal once you step back from Robbins and Freeman's performances.In other words, a high impact movie that rapidly loses credibility with considered thought after viewing. Far more worthwhile, though, than many other similarly stretched dramas and by no means a failure. But by no means in the top rank of movie making.	7
 do I want to write the 234th comment on	Do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	7
 A cinematic phenomenon		8
 Simply Amazing	When someone who has never seen this asks why this is my favorite movie - I never know what to tell them. It's the perfect movie, it's like God decided to allow the creators, writers, and actors to blend perfectly together - with the end result being the greatest movie ever written. The first time I saw it, I thoroughly enjoyed it but didn't allow for the intake of dramatic genius to fully set in. I have seen it over 100 times since I first 'experienced' it, and now it is impossible for me to watch any scene without getting chills down my spine. Frank Darabont should have a day made in his name for his adaptation of Stephen King's compelling and brilliant story. No one could have surmised that allowing for one of the more likable inmates to be killed would make the movie even MORE powerful...but he did. One last thing...I just wanted to thank God for allowing them to change the ending to that of a diminishing Robbins and Freeman at the end, no words needed.	10
 Simply AMAZING!	Definitely NOT your ordinary Stephan King adaptation. 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the few movies I've seen, where emotion and story are perfectly blended into one absolutely AMAZING story! You can feel the terror from Andy's trial, you can feel the happiness from the beer on the roof scene,the anger from scenes involving The Sisters, the shock when he learns that Tommy was killed, and the hope, joy and happiness gathered together when Andy escapes.The acting was amazing, the adaptations from the book were spot-on, this is the greatest adaptation I have ever seen. Of all the people in the world, I have never met one person who didn't enjoy it.If you haven't seen it; why are you sitting there? Go out and rent it and see for yourself, how amazing this film is!	10
 It is a good film and i like it		
 Number two? Fine by me **** (out of ****)	I have long viewed the Shawshank Redemption as the most underrated film of all time.  That isn't to say that it wasn't universally acknowledged by the movie-going public as a great movie, but in terms of awards, critical acclaim, and best ever lists, this has somehow kept on losing out.  Now that I see it has the number two position, as voted by the movie-going public, on probably the most accurate best ever list in the world (AFI be damned), I am eminently pleased.  There is no way Forrest Gump should have won best picture over Shawshank.  Certainly, Forrest Gump is a charming, well-acted film, but it is nothing compared to this.  Morgan Freeman excels, and Tim Robbins turns in his best performance.  If you haven't seen this masterpiece, get up and rent it immediately.	10
 One of the best movies of all time	When I first saw this film I wasn't that Mesmorised but as I thought about it I began to notice it's Symbolism. The more I thought about it the more I liked it and now it is my second favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors of are generation and the thing I love most about him is his voice. Tim Robbins is perfect as a quit sincere Andy Dufranse.This is one of the best movies ever made and deserves more publicity from critics.	
 One of the best flicks of the decade.	"An outstanding movie about perseverance, brains and irony. It's certainly the greatest prison movie ever made. But there's a lot more involved than your average prison flick has to offer. Try character and character development for starters.The best thing King has written, I love ""Salems Lot"" but how can you top this one."	10
 A wonderful movie! A true mind over matter picture!	I have always loved movies in which to overcome odds, a character must think, and not just use muscle. The Shawshank Redemption is one of, if not, the best example of this!!! I LOVE IT!	10
 Friendship carries thru time	"I am so pleased to see the high rating this movie has received. Many people I know have never heard of it, but when I tell them about it and they rent it, they are 'converted'!! Compared to so many recent movies that are eye-candy, this film delivers the true meaning of friendship and focuses on this aspect instead of flasy cars, lasers, dumb plots and high paid actors bloated with self confidence.Another movie along the same line is ""Spitfire Grill"". Rent it and you will probably enjoy it as much."	10
 one of the best	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  It is truly one of the most fulfilling movies ever made.  There are so many good things about it that it is hard to even come close to mentioning all of them, so I'll only mention the one thing I liked the most.  I liked the fact that the movie could have ended a couple different times, and it still would have been one of the best, but for Shawshank that just wasn't good enough. It kept going until you felt the ending was so perfect, that you truly had to sit back breathless.  I love this movie and it will always be one of the best as far as I am concerned.  A true classic!	10
 An enduring testament to the human spirit		10
 My personal favorite		10
 Few shows offer What the Shawshank Redemption does	In the first thirty minutes of watching this show on a slow Saturday afternoon I knew it was my favorite.  I was captured instantly by how the story unfolded.  You can't help but deeply respect Andy Dufrain (I don't know if thats spelled correctly).  The way he speaks with thought and hope, the way he walks about the jail collecting rocks.  Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he is imprisoned in a jail.  They couldn't have found a person that suited the roll of Red better than Morgan Freeman.  His voice is perfect for the narration of the film.  Every card played by this movie was an ace.  From the way they filmed the tall, barren walls of the prison to the brilliant story( thanks to Stephen King for that), and let's not forget the music.  I am pleased to see that it's in the top spot of this site, I think it deserves it.	10
 The best, pure and simple.		
 9 on a scale of 10		9
 One of the best	I really like this movie.  It was very well done and the screen play was great.  Totally awesome plot and the best acting I have ever saw.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It was a movie to die for.  You could tell that they put time and efffort into making this masterpiece.	10
 Faithful Story Telling	"Stephen King was surely pleased to see one of his works faithfully represented on-screen. The director does an excellent job of showing the bleakness of prison life, the frustration of a life gone awry, and the misery of losing all one holds dear in life, while somehow preserving the hope of better things to come. Every actor was perfectly cast and the story-line draws to a perfect and satisfying close. If you enjoyed the film, you'll love the book from whence it came; ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption""."	10
 Didactic and overlong		1
 Am i missing something??	The basic story for this dreadful movie is Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner i think am missing something with this movie, having now seen it twice. Its 1 of the most predictable boring movies i have ever seen. The bit were all the prisoners stop and listen to the opera music is just laughable. This just would not happen with hardened prisoners. This is also one of the poorest performances i have seen from Morgan freeman, why he took this role on i will never know. Go watch the Green Mile, its much finer work from the duo of Stephen King and Frank Darabont	1
 What's all the fuss about?	"Obviously I missed the point of this movie.  After years of people telling me how fantastic it was and noting how high it regularly comes in opinion polls, I finally watched it recently.Somehow I seem to have come to completely the opposite conclusion to almost everyone else.  Maybe my expectations were too high but I was very, very disappointed.  The plot was predictable and dull, the directing pretty droll.  Not much else I can say about it, other than to ask people if I have missed something key that would alter my perception of this film?Who am I to go against the vast popularity of this picture?  I must be the exception that proves the rule. This (apparently) is a ""must see"" movie."	1
 Proof That The Internet Can Be Misleading	"The notion that this movie belongs in the top 100 of anybody's list is simply retarded.  This B-movie with an A-movie list is standard, run of the mill, TV-movie-of-the-week fare.  How did it get this high?  What's wrong with the vast number of IMDB users that they would vote so highly in favor of such a piece of trite?  My theory: Tim Robbins is sending each of you a check.  That's the only explanation.  This movie offers nothing special: nothing different, nothing unique.  No great performances (a phoned-in Morgan Freeman performance akin to his ""Deep Impact"" presidential performance), no graphic portrayals or stark realism of life behind bars--nothing. This movie achieves what few in history have done: it both sucks AND blows."	1
 emotional strangulation	"It's an ""emotional manipulation for dummies"" type of film, with boring direction and cardboard characters. Nice performances by the actors though, some great moments, but nothing outside the ""Hallmark meets Stephen King meets Prison"" feel of the entire movie.I saw it one and a half times, and would see it again only if I got paid for the trouble.Similarly, I hated 'The Green Mile"", only later did I find out it's the work of Darabont.My recommendation: Skip this, and go see OZ again."	6
 The plain & simple truth. It doesn't deserve to be at #2.	just read the title. Tough I think it's a pretty decent movie (but not as good as the Stephen King's novel) i just can't understand why it should deserve to be ahead of everyone else in the top 250 (with the exception of the godfather). To be honest i don't even really think it should be in the top 250. Yeah, I know you Americans love the happy-ending Vaseline-flavored subtly homosexual jail movies, but all this hype it's too much anyway. Come on, this can't be better than Welles, Kubrick, Kurosawa or Scorsese (or not even Carpenter and Fulci in my humble opinion) So I give it a 1/10. This is not a critical valuation of the movie. This is a political statement.	1
 A good movie but definitely not #2 of all time	This is certainly a good movie, with universal themes of freedom and adversity etc etc, but... I've seen plenty of movies which were more artfully made than this one. There is nothing revolutionary in the directing. The novella by Stephen King is practically tailor-made for a movie adaption, and it seems any capable director could have made a good movie from it. I think the only reason this movie is #2 on this list is the sheer amount of people who have seen it and voted. The other truly great movies near the top of the list don't pack the same mass audience appeal that Shawshank Redemption does, nor are they shown on TNT 6-10 times a year. Movies like 2001, The Seven Samurai, or Lawrence of Arabia, for example, would bore many of the people who love Shawshank Redemption, and I personally consider those three I named and many others to be far better creations than the Shawshank Redemption. Perhaps we should take a poll of TNT viewers on the best movie of all time - I'd bet Shawshank Redemption would place first, with The Blues Brothers coming in a close second.	1
 After a big buildup, a real disappointment	"After reading all the rave reviews for this movie, it turned out to be a real disappointment.  Can anyone really believe that the prisoners are honourable men while the guards and warden are all ""crooks""??  Haven't we overdone the hypocritical ""Bible thumper""?? -- let's find a more enlightened characterization.  James Bond, himself, could not have followed the main character's escape plan.  The ending soliloquy and denouement were inferior plagiarisms from ""Cool Hand Luke"".  Enough!!!  Unfortunately, fine performances by both Robbins and Freeman were wasted in this ""fantasy"" story."	1
 Most Overrated Film of All Time	Sorry folks but this movie is a C movie and not an A. I can't believe that people like this movie so much. Yes I am biased, I really don't like Tim Robbins but he has made a decent movie or two but this ain't one of them. This is your basic prison movie. What can I say- it has the host of usual characters.  The storyline is basic, the outcome I won't say but it is just stupid to say that this is a great movie. I didn't think it was realistic at all and anybody who falls for this crap is either delusional or needs some brains to differentiate between an Edsel and a Lamborghini. I wouldn't watch this movie again unless I was paid to do so. One viewing is enough for this predictable laugher.	1
 Not the greatest movie of all time	Shawshank is nothing more than a fairy tale.  It tells us as much about what prison is really like as Pretty Woman tells us about what prostitution is really like.  People like fairy tales, so both these movies were very popular.	1
 Not the best prison movie	"This movie is a mystery to me. I couldn't find anything exceptional on it. It's another HBO stuff, without any aesthetic achievement and It's absolutely conformist. But there is a fact: people love it. I want to be fair: the movie is OK, but people put it in the same place than The Godfather! Maybe I'm wrong, but it's not the best picture of all the times, not even the best prison picture of all the times. Now I'm remembering ""Cool Hand Luke"" or ""American Me"", they are stronger and wiser. But..people has the last word."	4
 The same old story	It is strange that this movie is 2nd in imdb chart, as it is the same old american story, where good people win, and bad guys died. More strange, the USA is still the place where this story must sound more false.	4
" good one but not the ""second best of all time""..."	"I cant understand why this movie got such a high rating. its a good movie but there are lots of others that deserve to be number 2 in the ""best of all time list"" (american beauty, pulp fiction, Chaplin's, Buñuel's or Kubrick's movies, just to name a few). Well..I'm an old Stephen King fan and the story of ""Redemtion"" is good and thrilling and the acting and photography is good as well but its nothing that has'nt been made before. don't get me wrong i liked it but i think its just a well made entertaining picture and nothing more.So watch it and have a good time but don't expect an artistically great work or something all too original."	7
 Deserving of its praise	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sent to Shawshank prison: For Life. Andy is a very intelligent man, a hot shot banker when he was free, and now he's just a number, at the mercy of Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and his head guard, Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown).Andy is a quiet man, but manages to attract the attention of the sisters (Barely Human Homosexual rapists) led by Bogs (Mark Rolston) and he begins his prison life, desperately fighting his admirers, sometimes he'd win, sometimes he'd lose, but he always stayed quiet.Red (Morgan Freeman) is the man who can get things, and he is Andy's first friend on the inside. We witness Andy's relationships with Red, the Guards, the Warden, the sisters and the rest of the inmates, develop through Morgan Freeman's perspective, but always revolving around Andy. In his time there he successfully wins personal battles, gains favour with the guards and inmates alike, and restructures the rehabilitation of so many with his unwavering persistence and drive.All the members of the cast are more than adequate, but i have to single out Freeman and Robbins. Freeman guides the viewing audience in an informative and subtle manner, and Robbins, in his finest performance ever, gives us hope and wisdom, as he manipulates the powers around him so cleverly, to make life as easy as he can for all his fellow inmates.The Movie is very powerful and moving throughout, and it doesn't shy away from the darker aspects of prison life. And at the end when the climax falls into place, you will be left completely satisfied by its unquestionable brilliance.For those who have not seen this movie, all i can say is watch it.10/10	10
 Good acting, average story	** Some spoilers about the general storyline **I had some expectations regarding this movie, because of the excellent rating it got here. To start with the positive: the acting (especially by the two protagonists) is indeed of the highest level, and some scenes really grip you. The camera-work is also excellent (beautiful prison-building!)The story of this movie is a 13-in-a-dozen story about someone who (of course) is wrongly sentenced to a long story; who meets his new friend (mostly an elderly person), who makes enemies and defeats them, who turns his long-stay into something good, then is betrayed by his corrupt warden, etc. etc. Sometimes it even got a bit cheesy, the way in which all the prison cliché's were displayed.I could recommend this movie to you, if you are looking for a nice drama with good acting and good camera. Don't expect an Oscar-worthy movie, though.	7
 Well-Done Everyone's Hollywood Flick without Flaw	With universal themes such as redemption, friendship, and good-defeats-evil tale, and without any significant technical flaws, it may be difficult to dislike Shawshank Redemption, one of well-done Hollywood flicks in the 90s by invisible employee directors, while it may also be difficult to find it compelling, imaginative, and inspirational. Despite a prison situation Tim Robbins keeps looking ridiculously gorgeous all the time, but this is made-in-Hollywood.	5
 A fantasy indeed.	The popularity of this film seems to stem with the current emotional appeals and issues of today, just as Citizen Kane seemed to do when it was revived. What makes Citizen Kane more appealing to me though is the abundance of creativity in telling the story.If you want a highly emotional experience, I would watch this movie. Since I am for more intelligent and unpredictable type films, I am not one for movies like this.And if I would explain the movie in one sentence, I would say it is a classic cinema soap opera, perfectly crafted to emotionally stimulate movie viewers, in order for them to hold certain perspectives on societal issues.	7

 Frankly, I don't get it		5
 Crap	I'm not going to tip toe around it, this film is crap. Its completely unoriginal, its not artistic, its not demanding (except for being boring). You will not learn anything about the world through this film.This film is not a part cinematic history, unlike nearly all other films in the top 250. It is predictable and emotional crap.But even if your not into cinema, and you just like popcorn entertainment there are far better movies out there...basically any on the video shelf.	4
 very average	The only thing that amazes me about this movie is that it is not only within 500 top movies in IMDB but actually #2 and soon perhaps #1...I only saw Shawshank Redemption once, and have not been able to force myself to watch it in full length ever since. It was ok to see it once even though I was almost bored then, but not quite. I found it very average in every respect, and quite predictable. I guess that this is one of those movies that is so average that it does not bother anybody by invoking powerful emotions, thoughts or memories, and does not have any obviously bad technical quality. Just sooo average. Hence the high score?	
 A sociopath prison warden, sadistic guard as well as cuddly and misunderstood inmates.		1
 Sugary sentimental and unsatisfying	This drama has been widely vaunted as one of the best films ever made- personally I just can't see the appeal. Sure it contains very good performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman- but there have been other, much better screen performances by other actors. There is very little suspense or originality about the plot and nothing that hasn't been seen or done on screen a hundred times before. So why the popularity? It's a formulaic feel-good movie who's happy ending is never in doubt. Knowing that Stephen King wrote the novel on which the film was based would probably give that away anyway. As with any adaptation from book to film there are several differences between the two, though the film does, on this occasion, improve on the book.There have been better adaptations of King novels (The Shining) and better performances by better actors, yet for some reason this film continues to be rated as better than it actually is.	1
 Best movie ever made!	Best movie ever. I've seen it about 25 times now, and it never gets boring.	10
 Not as great as people say it is, but very good nevertheless		9
 Compelling masterpiece	I like the bit when the warden threw the rock through the poster.	10
 Vanilla	"Another highly ranked ""good, but not great"" flick.Every creative choice here seems to reinforce the idea of plainness. The staging, camera work, blocking, acting, set design, plot progression and execution are all plain. This must be the appeal to middle America.As for me, I usually appreciate a little more daring, a little more creativity in my films but it's easy to see why so many families can sit together and watch it every Thanksgiving.Not to be disparaging, sometimes audiences crave a film that is completely without pretense. But I need a little more if you expect me to sit there for 3 hours."	6
 One of the best movies I've ever seen	Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen.Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.	10
 10 stars 👌🏻	This is the definition of a what a Great movie supposed to be like!	10
 All time fave	I must have seen this at least a dozen times! It' has a variety of emotions that which I love in a film! I laughed, I cried and I was in suspense!They couldn't have picked better actors for these roles.I am from Maine so having a sniper of the movie take place in my state was also charming.It doesn't get old to watch!It's an upbeat version of Alcatraz 😂	10
 Absolutely Great	The storyline, the links, the twists, everything about this movie made me want to watch it all over again. It is the best movie I've seen by far. I recommend it 100%.	10
 There does not exist a more perfect movie.	After watching numerous amount of movies, a lot compares, however nothing beats The Shawshank Redemption. There is no flaw, i can think of, it has everything and it is extremely fulfilling and touching to watch.The ending also, really does it for me. I feel happy, and i feel fulfilled.This movie is a contender for the best movie i will ever have seen, they really don't make movies like this anymore.This is why, this is the only movie that actually deserves a 10/10.It is the closest to perfection, that i have ever witnessed in a movie.	9
 Great Movie	Full marks to the writers. Loved the quality....The prices are decent. No cons found.	10
 Rewatchable Uncountable Times	There are a very few movies that make you think ,think about the things that are important in life, things that truly matter and The Shawshank Redemption is surely one of those movies. It teaches you that life will put you in situations which you must not have imagined yourself to be in ever and how you can survive those situations.You will learn something new every time you watch it.	10
 This film	An outstanding story ,with fantastic cast that is truly make this viewing experience unforgetable.	10
 This movie will change your life.	This movie will change your life. A must see in 2020 to start out your next decade resolutions.	9
 nice	Nice film i cant speak english but nice,yes nicethe best	10
 Masterpiece.	The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece and a genius work of cinematic excellence. It is a true testament to human will, friendship, and determination. Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. The clashing themes of evilness and goodness within the prison system makes this film the compelling, and satisfying story it entails.	10
 One of the best movies all time	I saw this movie couple of times. Each time it gives me so much hope and courage to go further. Just bravo!	
 it's really very great	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10"	10
 Great	Amazing movie. I think the actors were great and that the story was well written and filmed.	10
 Greatest Movie	This movie so great and enjoyable. It has a gripping story. Not regret watching	10
 Accurate portrayal of the life behind bars	The entire movie isn't about how the protagonist of the story pays back the officials for stealing his life but it is also about patience, making a life where you live and helping people as you go. This movie celebrates friendship and reaffirms the fact that the friendships born at the most adverse situations are the ones that lasts the most. Every character is unique. From the guy who has spent the better part of his life behind bars and is unable to adjust to a different society to the guy who holds out till the end, every single character is fully developed. The rare scenery and lighting actually helps you feel like you are living the moment in the beer crate scene. You realize the freedom. You find that the little kind act has provided solace to all the prisoners. We are left to wonder if correctional institutions are actually serving the purpose they are meant to do as well as look at the dark side of law and politics where an innocent is captured and jailed.	10
 The greatest movie ever made!!!	First when I saw how huge the overall rating  was I wondered why. But then I told myself I should give it try, and truly it was totally worth it period. I miss this kind of movies. sush a masterpiece, it contain many lessons and significances about our life I'm still wondering how this masterpiece didn't win a oscar then I figured out that it is a small thing comparing this movie and if you don't watch it yet then you have miss a big part from your life	10
 Goosebumps.	As a younger viewer who wasnt born when the movie released, I can by heart say that movieproductions has gone downhill. Im not pointing out that all movies we produce today are bad, but that in 25 years of evolving in technology and having good actors, writers etc. No movies would stand a chance to being as good as this was. This movie shows the true art of directing and storytelling.Its a kind of movie that got me thinking, learning and at the same time connect emotionally with the characters.I pat myself on the back for going on IMDB and hitting the top rated movies of all time. If I didnt, I wouldnt have had the chance to view this masterpiece.	10
 Love it	Its a perfect example of a movie that never gets old. Love it.	7
 tied do i want	"Hy do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or"	10
 All time best!!	If ever there was a possibility of a Film being perfect, this is it!	10

 Excellent movie that i would recommend to every movie lover out there		10
 Stolen Movie Idea	"This picture is a rip-off from the Clint Eastwood movie called "" Escape from Alcatraz"" When you watch it carefully you'll notice the similarity between the two of them. And not only this movie is a rip-off , the Clint Eastwood's movie is also a stolen idea from the movie called "" A Man Escaped "" an old classic french movie."	5
 A Film That Shouldn't be Rented, Instead Buy It. Because You Will Watch It Again	My Personal Rating 9.8/10 - This is one of the most beautiful film that i have watched, same thing on godfather the cinematography the acting the atmosphere are so beautifully crafted. this film leaves me speechless it almost change the way that i think, i do believe this movie has some lessons on it. the way Morgan Freeman narrates the movie is so beautiful.. the quotes too. i don't want to spoil anything. anyone should watch this film.	10
 - Some things Are Best left Unsaid -		10
 Movie Summary	"Overrated. Whiny. 8 million better movies. Stop being sheep. Tim Robbins is a hack. Morgan Freeman is a c4tface. Guy goes to prison, Guy escapes prison. Somehow tunnels through concrete and s**t without anyone noticing. Guy leaves some s**t hidden for other Guy still in prison. Other Guy gets s**t. Some stuff happens in prison between those events. One dude is all emotional and stuff in a rainy scene. uhh what else.. Not much else. Morgan Freeman's character had a hardon for Tim Robbins. I dunno what do you want. This move was lame. Very long too. Could've been 30 minutes tops and still got its ""point"" across. Frank Darabont sucks. The walking dead sucks. The end."	5
 Best film ever made...	Watching this movie was a pleasure, the acting was outrageously good. A film without special effects and action every 5 minutes, just men in prison. All I can say is I would have loved this film to have been longer.The acting from Morgan Freeman is second to none, he proves in this film why he is regarded as one of the greatest actors to grace our screens. Anyone who hasn't seen this film needs too watch it straight after reading this review as it will change your opinion on a lot of other films.	10
 Great films come only once in a blue moon	Wow! what a film this baby is and yes this film is one of the most brilliant films ever written by man and i for one was literally stoked from the start, so as a future film maker, i hope to one day make a film like this because if i do i will definitely die a happier man. the film was just awesome in every sense and i really loved the plot, it had some great cliff hangers and great and classic scenes where the main character became himself more and you just fell in love with him so on that basis i would class this film as one of the all time greats and if you haven't seen it yet, go out and buy it because you won't be disappointed at all, believe you me.	10
 Yes...	"In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."	10
 Great film	"one of the films that you must watch in lifetime. A film about long-term imprisonment that takes its time to convey what the slow crawl of a lifer's existence might feel like. Thoroughly gripping, and pretty refreshing. Ten years ago The Shawshank Redemption was a low-key prison film that didn't recoup its costs. Slowly it has become one of the most popular movies of all time - and, for some, it has even been life- changing. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	10
 The Best Movie Ever Made	"Where do I start? When I first heard of The Shawshank Redemption I immediately wanted to watch it, mostly of its title, so as I always do I looked it up on IMDb and looked at the rating. It was the highest ranked movie on IMDb, and of course I would give it a go. The beginning was very interesting, with Andy being convicted of double homicide and seeing the lean-back of what happened. Him being found guilty, serving two life sentences in the toughest prison in America, Shawshank. I thought it would be another overrated boring movie like The Godfather, but no, it caught my attention from the start and never lost it either. The dramatic scenes, it gives you a glance of how it is in prison, the emotional scenes. It is all a masterpiece, there is a reason to why it is the best movie I have ever watched and probably will ever watch. The amazing acting, plot and moderate length. The last scene, with ""Red"" walking up the beach towards Andy and the credits slowly rolling in, it makes you beg for it to never end. When it comes to movies I can sometimes get a little emotional if its a good movie, which Shawshank is. It definitely deserves the spot as #1, I cannot understand how it didn't win an Oscar.I really recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good weekend, but get a load of potato chips and soda, since you will finish it all up very fast."	10
 Can't find a better movie		10
 The unbelievable creativity of a human mind..	I cant believe that something so simply good exists. This is by far the best thing i have ever watched on my TV. I loved every piece of it and i'm gonna watch it once a year till my time on this world is over. I can't describe the feeling and joy you will have after watching it, because i can't find the right words to describe it. Watch it and you will see what i mean. The first time is always the best. It's the time when it will leave you speechless for a couple of seconds. And after those seconds you will begin to understand that you just watched a masterpiece. What i liked the most is the big time span in which the movie plays. All those years in one place and the dependence for some people after you leave it.	10
 My review about Shawshank Redemption	"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)"	10
 have patience for the first half n hour	First of all you need to be prepared for this 3 hour long movie(though the movie worths it).Morgan freeman's background voice will keep you with the story.Dialogues were well executed.The strongest part was it's narration which makes it the best.I wouldn't have watched this if it wasn't on the top of IMDb list.At some point of time i felt the movie is just dragging on the story.Still at the end you won't mind it. The movie also carries the message of friendship,hope,will and brilliance of our protagonist.Sometimes i felt pity on him and sometimes i couldn't stop myself praising his brilliance.I think this movie will keep impressing generations ahead,no matter how much advance human becomes.	9
 Absolutely phenomenal, a true master class. This movie manages to show viewers how the difference between good and evil is about perception	I had heard a lot about this movie being a 'classic' and a 'must-see' and normally that negatively impacts my view of a movie because unrealistic expectation often ruins the true quality of a movie. This movie, however, managed to surpass all my expectations.I didn't know much concerning the story, except that it was a movie set in a prison but it's so much more than that. The major theme that became apparent to me throughout this movie was how we regard as good and evil is largely dependent on the storyteller and how he chooses to paint the heroes/villains. Convicted felons are not usually considered 'heroes' or people that you root for and want to succeed but the story is about so much more than that. The Shawshank Redemption is about hope and more importantly the struggle to maintain it, when the world is doing its best to crush it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on-screen chemistry is amazing. There are no weak scenes, no wasted dialogue. They are the best things about the movie, they make you believe, they make you hope.	10
 If you aren't a fan of Stephen King, Frank Darabont, or anyone else involved in this movie, you will be!		10
 About as perfect as a movie can be	I do not even feel as though I need to go into a great amount of detail to explain just how amazing this film is.You've probably seen the movie sitting on the top spot of 'IMDB's top 250', or maybe you've heard a friend babble on about how great the movie is and know it must be half-decent. I can assure you this will live up to your expectations. The acting, the plot, the setting, the cast, the directing, the messages and symbols, the acting again (deserves another mention) is just about as perfect as a movie can be in this setting. Please don't waste your time pondering over whether or not to see this movie or whether or not you should believe the hype because, I can assure you, you can. Go buy this from your local movie store or buy it online - I really don't care - just make sure you watch this film before anything else. As an 18-year-old guy, I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. Go watch it! Now!	10
 Phenomenal	"Personally I was, and I am ashamed to say this, quite late to join the huge number of film fans that would hold The Shawshank Redemption within their Top 5 films of all time - if not number 1. If you're wondering mine is ""The Princess Bride"", childhood favourite but that's beside the point.I think the first time I watched it was in 2006 and I instantly fell in love with it. I now watch the film at least 5/6 times a year without fail and I am hardly ever far from tears of joy by the end.If you use the old analogy of ""If an alien came to earth show them how..."" to make a film, you would show them this as the blueprint.Just brilliant."	10
 Just Exceptional!	I'd heard about this film a few years ago and I'd heard it was good. I was lied to. This film wasn't good, It was outstanding! I can't believe I never watched this sooner! From the opening scenes where the mysterious Andy Dufresne is being dragged into hell to the credits as Red runs across the beach to him, this film was, in a word, Perfect! No holes to spot, almost everything was completely accurate, Probably some of the best script I've ever heard and a brilliant story. Normally, If a film goes over two hours, I start to get a little bored and I end up wanting the film to end but this was completely the opposite! I never wanted this to end and the hefty 140 minutes get you wanting more and the story drew me in so much, I felt as if I was there. Normally with films adapted from Stephen King books, they don't do so well on the big screen but this has proved that wrong! Overall, I like this film because it's realistic, it goes into great depth and the story is so gripping, you can't take your eyes off the screen and this film will always be there at the top as one of my favourite films ever!	
 Review - The Shawshank Redemption		10
 The greatest movie of all time	The best movie ever made, period. I won't go on a very long and detailed review on the story(which is magnificent and perfect)I just want to say that this movie is a pure piece of art. The acting was perfect! I'm really disappointed that the actors didn't have enough recognition for their performances! Actually, the overall movie was underestimate, by the Oscars especially.This movie shows why cinema is an art, powerful and heart full art. See this movie, you'll now what I'm talking about. I really tried to notice some gripes or problems but, I can't. This movie is touching, sad, beautiful, powerful and perfect. By the way, f**k the Academy Awards for dumping this movie and do for Forrest Gump for the trophies,but it's just trophies... Still a shame that they decided that.11 out of ten, totally deserves it.	10
 My all time favorite film	"This film is about hope, friendship and redemption. It has solid performances from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton (the warden). Freeman masterfully narrates and he is the life blood of this film. You experience everything through him; friendship, despair, hope, redemption and happiness. The musical score is nothing short of fantastic and really elevates some of the more moving scenes in the film.Firstly, this film is about hope. Andy is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank prison. He has no friends and is quickly picked on at arrival because of his quiet, unassuming nature. But as time passes, the other inmates begin to respect Andy because he doesn't allow prison to break him. Andy perseverance is so strong that it begins to rub off on the others. I think to really get this film, you need to step away from the context of it just being a prison movie. You could say the prison is life. The warden and the guards are problems, trials and troubles in life that can test and possible break you.No matter how bad things yet, no matter what brutal things you have to endure, you've gotta hold out hope, you gotta hang on, you have to believe you're gonna get through it. This is about the very nature of the human spirit, told in a very simple, straight forward way.This film is also about the power of friendship. I think Hollywood seems to have a hard time portraying a meaningful, male friendship and just resorts to endless buddy and stoner movies. Shawshank does a great job of this. I felt this aspect of the film was told in 2 parallel stories. The first was the old librarian, Brooks. When he was released, he struggled to adapt to the new world. As Red says, he had become institutionalized so much so that without Shawshank he felt alone, afraid and had no purpose. In the end, it was just too much for him to bear. Easily one of the more heartbreaking scenes in the film, gets me every time. When Red is released, he faces the exact same challenges that Brooks did. And he too struggled and almost lost hope. The only thing that kept him him going, was his friendship with Andy. As Freeman narrates:""There's a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole, so maybe they'd send me back. Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. Only one thing stops me. A promise I made to Andy.""It was literally the only thing he felt worth living for and a key part of the film I think people forget. And before Andy left prison, you could see how it deeply affected Red. He had lost his friend and the heartbreak of it was written all over Freeman's face, fantastic acting if you ask me; it was subtle, quiet suffering.And finally the film is about Redemption. Some people feel the redemption is Andy's. But I believe that Andy was just the agent of Red's redemption. At the start of the film Red was pretty much redesigned to life in prison. He had accepted that these were just the cards he was dealt and there was no real reason to feel otherwise; he had given up hope. The first few times he went for his parole hearing, Red was just going through the motions, he was just saying what he thought he had to get to be let out. It was completely insincere.You can see an the film progresses Andy changing Red. There's a great scene where Red mentions that he used to play the harmonica. Andy gets him one as a present and later, in a small but important scene, Red picks up the Harmonica and he quietly plays a note. For me this is where Red begins to believe again. But the key scene for me is the last parole hearing. Red has been so affected by Andy, that for the first time he has a genuine moment of repentance, where he honestly admits to his crime:""There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, or because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try and talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bullshit word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a bleep.""It really is just an incredible, moving scene, one of my all time favorites. Red is completely broken and regretful, it's nothing short of movie magic. And the ending? Well, let's just say it leaves me with a smile on my face. In my opinion this is the greatest film ever made. An incredibly powerful, uplifting story. If you haven't seen this, you need to.http://andretms.blogspot.ca/"	10
 The Most Magnificent Movie Ever		10
 The placement isn't an exaggeration	"As of March 2012, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty on the ""IMDB Top 250"" list with 731,886 ratings averaging at about 9.2/10. That's astounding. On Rotten Tomatoes, a site much more critical where it is a rarity that new movies possess a ""fresh"" rating, the film has merited a 90%. Another commendable achievement. I bring these two facts up because I'm just amazed at how high the film is ranked. Here's a film that holds the ""IMDB Top 250"" list by a long shot, yet doesn't immediately come to people's mind when thinking ""the best movie of all time."" Of course, being on the ""IMDB Top 250"" doesn't qualify as an official listing. Being featured on AFI's list is more respectable, but still, it is subjective. Just a bit more broader and stronger, since a group of high intellectuals choose the films. If one looks further down the ""Top 250"" list, you'll see a number of questionable entries such as The Dark Knight, Inception, and Toy Story 3. Their presence doesn't necessarily mean they're the best - just the highest rated by people.But I have no quibbles about Shawshank's placing on the list; it is a wonderful, wholesome parable about redemption and reassurance of one's self worth while locked inside a penitentiary. We are met with characters who are trying to escape the confines of a monotonous lifestyle in prison, bot mentally and physically, and find a rare amount of comfort when with each other. The film is adapted from Stephen King's short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption - a novella that isn't so much physical suspense and horror as it is psychological horror; a different route for King, an author who has focused so much on the supernatural and the victimized outcasts in his long career.We are placed in Shawshank State Penitentiary, located in Maine in 1947, where Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is convicted of murdering his cheating wife and her lover and is given two life sentences. Andy assures he is innocent, but circumstances prove differently. He meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Freeman), a man too serving life, who acts as a con man who can get you anything you want as long as you give him his asking price plus 20%. At first, Red doesn't think too much of Andy, betting ten cigarettes with his buddies that he'll cry the first night in prison.Andy doesn't cry. He seems rather content, despite the treatment and hell he has been through. As time passes, by time I mean years and eventually decades, Andy's relationship with Red grows. They become understanding of each others positions, and Red takes a rare liking to the man. So do many other prisoners. At first, Andy is a victim of mistreatment and abuse from his villainous and heartless prisoners, but he eventually keeps his head held high, and works out deals with Warden Samuel Norton, who is played by Bob Gutton in a scarcely recognized performance that is equal parts frightening and breathtaking, to do odd-jobs around the prison to earn money, but more importantly, respect.Not only do the prisoners become smitten with him, but the guards, policemen, and suits alike. They admire his persistency. There comes a time where Andy desperately wants more funding for Shawshank, not just for bars, guards, and walls, but for books and to assimilate growth for the feeble and decrepit library currently in the prison. The guard tells him that he can write as many letters as he wants but the state government won't pay any mind. So, Andy patiently writes one letter every week to try and convince them why extra funding is vital.Here's where the spoiler comes in. The film's main morals are optimism, self worth, and hope. The film's tagline perfectly spells out its identity; ""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free."" There is a character in the film named Brooks (Whitmore), who is the prison trustee. Upon being released from the penitentiary, Brooks commits suicide by hanging himself. The reason was because he never had any sort of dreams or plans. Never any vision of hope or compassion for anyone. He was just a human being living in fear. Andy succeeds because he has learned to carry optimism on his shoulders. He eventually teaches Red the same lesson.The spoiler's over. Moving on, the film illustrates the passing time, which I mentioned was decades, beautifully and naturally. The film will seem long to some, but it shows how slowly the prison life plods along. How mundane and redundant it must get to get up, confined to small rooms, and work for very low wages every day. And you thought your corporation job was miserably insufferable.But where Shawshank really excels is in its humanism. It evokes prisoners as people, with morals and livelihood. Not as monsters. It is true, many, many people in prison deserve to be there, but we never look past the caricature of a psychopath or a deviant when we think about what kinds of people are really in there. They're not all bad people. People who question me on that should contemplate long and hard on this question; is Red a bad person? Or even a monster? The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous journey through parts rarely explored. It is immersing in not only its characters and story, but in its touching, light cinematography which projects a wide range of dispositions throughout the entire excursion. Rarely does a film rub us this way, and rarely does one seem to rub everyone the same way. All the more reason, its placement on the ""Top 250"" really isn't an exaggeration.Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gutton. Directed by: Frank Darabont."	10
 Best Movie Of The Era	To be brief, as a man who has watched thousands of movies in my life, Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen. The plot, the way it develops, the acting, the portrayal of every human emotion, and the ending makes 99% of movies seem like just a waste of time. I didn't see it until a few years after it came out. My sister said it was a great movie. It was on HBO, so I watched it. I was speechless. I have always found it strange that it was from a Steven King novel. I've read a few (not that one) and what comes through in the movie doesn't seem like anything that would be in a Steven King novel. A better movie may come along but it may be a while.	10
 The best film I have ever seen	"This review contains spoilers so better see the film and then read my review.Sometimes it makes me wonder why this film didn't go well in the box office. Shawshank redemption is not just about a story where a man escapes from a jail. It captures the life of people who spend their life in jail. I believe that jail life and free life are almost similar. Sometimes we enjoy and sometimes we feel sad whether you live in jail or not. Sometimes life doesn't make any sense at all. Some people succeed in their lives with ease and some people faces a great deal of hardship and still won't succeed in their life. These people are forced to the point of desperation. What they should know is that all of us have a destiny to reach and the main thing which matters the most is ""hope"" which you should need until the moment you die. If you believe in yourself and have hope then one day you will reach your destiny in this life or in your after life.This film has really changed my way of looking the life."	10
 Simply the best film ever made.	Well as the other more than 2000 review say it, in my opinion this is the best movie created so far. It basically just how life is: you get punched in a face time to time, but you have to stand up, keep your hope and give value to your fellows, because in return life takes care about your reward. Oh yes, and if you face any evil that you can stop, do it. This is the message of the film, if we follow it, life may be as rewarding ultimately for us as for the hero. Other films that moved me like this: Forrest Gump, The curious case of Benjamin Button. IMDb says I have to write another line in order for them to post my review so here it is xD	10
 Best film ever		10
 I just love this movie		
 Best movie ever	One of the best movies that i have ever seen.It truly transcends time and is an epic in all proportions.People just don't make movies like this anymore and this is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie is About Andy Dufrane,a banker who has been wrongfully acquitted of killing his wife in cold blood and send to shaw shank prison.the movie shows the various hardships faced by Andy and how he does not give up hope and carries on with patience and finally becomes free. the climax is absolutely spellbinding and will leave you aghast.it is a truly great movie and i was aghast at finding out that this movie was a failure in the box office.BUT NOW ALMOST EVERYONE RECOGNIZES THIS MOVIE FOR WHAT IT TRULY IS - A MASTERPIECE OF STORYTELLING.	10
 Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption	"I never saw this film on the silver screen. I didn't want to see it on video either.The video store owner implored me to watch it and I remember my emphatic reply. ""I'm not watching a 3 hour film about a prison con doing tax returns for the guards"". Fortunately for me, this video store owner was a mightily persistent sort and I begrudgingly walked home not knowing that I had just rented the greatest film ever made.This film received no hype nor the mega-bucks publicity given to a lot of movie trash out there. Because they didn't need to - all they needed to do was to let people watch it because word of mouth is the best marketing ticket in town. And so it proved.The movie is long and relies on a storyline which has been covered many times. Wrongful conviction, brutality in jail, justice in the end. But it is the way in which the story is told and acted out that defines it, quite rightly, as IMDb's top ranked film.I don't care for Stephen King as an author but his vivid imagination coupled with his skill at telling a story (a short story in this case) is top drawer. We have a man (Dufresne) who after being convicted wrongfully for murder, uses his accounting skills in jail solely to survive. Red (Freeman), the man who can ""get things"" befriends him. The story then slowly unravels with shocking scenes of brutality intertwined with flickers of how the human spirit can overcome the most hazardous odds. The Warden, Samuel Norton, is magnificent as a man whose corruption has spiralled out of control and will do almost anything to retain the status quo. Clancy Brown as the brutal guard completes the double act.The story twists and turns leaving the audience not quite knowing whether we are in for a harrowing or euphoric ending. And when the ending comes on that Mexican Beach you can almost hear the triumphant cheers ringing around the cinema halls.This is film making at its very best and it is highly unlikely that Robbins and Freeman will ever better it. Its one of those few occasions where 10 stars is not nearly high enough.So if you have been living under a rock or are as sceptical as I was in the early 90's, then it's time for me to adopt my friendly video store owners guise and say ""Watch this - its the best film ever made""."	10
 My #1	"I was reluctant to see this movie - thought it was just another prison movie - and I was certainly tired of mindless violence. I was channel surfing one evening - and stumbled across this movie. I watched a few minutes, thinking I would change channels at the first commercial. Almost 2 hours later - after seeing the end - I sat there...saying ""Wow"". That was a great movie. I have since recommended it to friends and family...it has grown in popularity due to word of mouth - and certainly deserves its spot at the top. Morgan Freeman put on a masterful performance, as did Tim Robbins. The way their friendship develops and the interplay with the other inmates - a wonderful story.If you have not watched this movie yet - put preconceived notions aside, sit down, and enjoy the journey!"	10
 One of the best movies ever made.	There have been many cases in film history when a film is terrific do to the actors. Then there are some films are great because of what was written. With The Shawshank redemption, IMDb's favorite film, in works in both cases. The acting is superb, and the film is incredibly well written and very justified.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, a banker who has been accused of murdering his wife and her lover. So he is sent to Shawshank prison, where he experience's lots of things. He forms a bond with Red(played terrificly by Morgan Freeman). The warden(played by Bob Gunton) hates him. He is raped. And all of this is leading to his escape after being in there for over twenty years.The Shawshank redemption, which is based on a shot story by Stephen King, is one of the most interesting films ever made. It'a also one of the best films ever made too. What is one way to tell: When you hear Morgan Freeman's narration, you know you're in good hands.The acting is explosive. Everyone does such a good job. The Shawshank redemption is a little long, but the length is tolerable. Mainly because from the opening scene the film has you hooked. Morgan Freeman gives the better performance of the two, but the duo of Robbins and Freeman is once in a lifetime.The Shawshank redemption was an Oscar upset. It was nominated for seven, including Best picture, Best actor(Morgan Freeman) and best writing. And it lost best picture to Forrest Gump, which is also a great movie. 94 was the year of Pulp fiction also. Another Oscar upset. I prefer Pulp fiction, but The Shawshank redemption is still one of the best films ever made.The Shawshank redemption:A+	10
 My favorite movie of all time	This is a very, very, very, great film. It's my all time favorite. First of all the acting is f**king great. My favorite actor in the entire film is easily Morgan Freeman. He should have won that Oscar! The fact that he didn't is a f**king disgrace. Now the music to this movie is not to memorable but is still great and sets the mood for the film. Now the story line is brilliant. Andy Dufresne is accused of the murder of the wife and her secret lover, so he is sentenced to Shawshank State Prison. There he develops a friendship with a prisoner named Red. The sets in this movie are great. As expected. So in the end this is a great movie and you should really check it out.	10
 The Epitome of film Excellence.	"I always define films as an artistic medium for a person to immerse himself to a place full of positivity and hope in an unending hymn. And for generation after generation there's only one film that I will always give praise for, finally giving a masterpiece that successfully delivers that thought. A film called The Shawshank Redemption.Never has been before the film came out, illustrates the triumph of human spirit behind any hardship in the most moving manner until this inspiring film. It's powerful in every way, that for me it brought back the real definition of an excellent film which is ""a great story with great characters"".Mainly about Andy Duferne (Tim Robbins) a skilled banker who was convicted for murdering his wife and her third party who's a pro golfer. Duferne, sentenced for double life imprisonment was sent to the notorious and sullen looking Shawshank prison to serve his sentence. While counting his days inside, several events happened to Andy. Meeting ""the sisters "" was one of his hardships he needed to go thorough, as they sexually assault selected prisoners like him, which made his stay harder and longer than he thought. One day, he also met Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was literally known to get things and run it through the walls of the prison, as Andy asked him for a hammer. Unknown to Andy, Redding had his bet on him earlier, as the first one amongst the newest batch of inmates to break down. Subtlety, the two became prison buds as the days became months and the months became years. The two almost stick together the whole time of their stay. They conversed things about the realities of prison. Which at times they contradicted at each other's opinion for Andy had always been the ""hopeful dreamer"" and Redding with his face of realism.The story soon evolves into great circumstances in favor of Andy, in spite of being a workhorse inside the prison, exploited by several police and the warden himself for his skill of handling money, Andy through his skill, will, and hope proved that there were great things waiting to happen for those who hoped and wait. For he always believed that HOPE is a great thing, that everyone should always have.The Shawshank Redemtion is a film for the ages. Its beauty as a whole will never fade as it is one of those greatest films that show an almost tangible message to fathom. It is substance over style at the end of the day. And what it evokes is what matters which leaves you moved and some even satisfied for every tear that they shed from an abundance of happiness gave by a magnificent piece of literature.It's the best film I've seen and it will always be carved to the bank of triumphant feeling.Truly excellent, 10/10."	10
 Luck is good but Hope is better		10
 A masterpiece.		10
 A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart	It is year 2009 and yet this movie is still the best movie I have ever seen. It truly and rightfully deserves to be the best movie of all times. Story telling, acting, directing, anything that you can imagine about a movie is so perfectly done. I believe everyone will have his own message from the movie but if you want to see a movie that tells how important the role of hope in our life is, you are at the correct address. The atmosphere in the prison, the way people feel and the way all these things were put together in a two hours movie; there is nothing to say. It is just exceptionally plain good. A must to see movie for everyone that carries a heart.	10
 Shawshank never won best picture one of the greatest crimes at the Oscars in History		10
 The Shawshank Redemption Is An Excellent Film		9
 The Best Film Ever Made	Seriously, if ever there's a film that people should be forced to watch, it's this. The acting in it is truly perfect, the storyline in very, very well written and the ending is one of the cleverest (and most misleading) endings I have ever witnessed. This film can (and will) be enjoyed by people of all ages (relatively - check parents guide for suitability), and will keep you in suspense for the full duration. Unlike in most other Hollywood films, the twists in the storyline are very well executed and it is in no ways cheesy or cheap. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his life without making his fellow actors over-act. The Shawshank Redemption blows every other prison dramas out of the water. See it at all costs.	10
 Phenomenal Movie!		10
 My Favourite Movie Of All Time	This is beyond doubt my favourite movie of all-time. I am a Morgan Freeman fan and apart from Driving Miss Daisy, i have loved all his movies that i have seen. The Shawshank Redemption stands above all. I think it is a great movie with a sad overall story but a happy and just ending. The only other prison movie i like as much is the classic Clint Eastwood movie Escape from Alcatraz. The Shawshank Redemption has long been my favourite movie and even though i have the DVD, i still watch when it is on TV. 15 years since its release and i still haven't seen anything i like more. I would recommend this movie to everyone and if you haven't seen it yet, you must be living in a cave or something. If you are in a cave, get out and go see this fantastic movie. 10/10	10
 Wow!!	When Shawshank begins, for about the first two minutes it seems nothing more than a made-for-TV movie. However, as the story progresses you find out how amazing it really is. Yet how can a film that contains rape, beatings and suicide make you feel so good at the end? Frank Darabont manages to do this so well. The Green Mile gives you a warm feeling at the ending, but not like this does. I just love the way it follows the subplot of Brooks right up until he kills himself. How touching that was to see an old man, let out of prison but without routine. He belonged in prison, not in the outside world.You forget at times that you are watching a movie. It sucks you in and moves you. If you haven't seen Shawshank you have missed out on one of the finest movies ever made. But don't worry - you're not beyond redemption! Watch it!	10
 Life has never been more beautiful!	This movie is one that gives to wit the most part of being happy in this life. It is true that you might not be lucky enough in life but even in the midst of crap, even when all your life has crumbled over your face, hope is still your last hope.One night he caught his wife cheating and was thrown in jail for a murder that he had not committed and after all that he got raped! What would you have done had you been in his shoes? keep on hoping? Well, Andy not only had hope, he gave hope to his fellow prisoners. The brilliant Morgan Freeman gives the cherry on the top in this movie and if he weren't in this movie, the movie would have lacked something for sure.There are scenes and lines that you will never forget in this movie and I have commented on hundreds of movies but very few I gave the full 10 out of 10 and this movie is one of those few.	10
 The greatest movie I've ever seen	"I'll admit, I'd held off on seeing the Shawshank Redemption. I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie. It will most certainly change your life. It did mine."	10
 simply awesome	This movie proves its worth of having top spot on IMDb list.It is not only entertaining but also with a lesson never loose hope as it is the best thing a man can have.Great acting displayed by lead actors specially Morgan freeman.Truly a moving movie with great moral&climax.Dialouges of this film are well written. You will miss something if HAVE not watch it. Highly recommendable for those who have give up their hope in life. they will find how hope will get best of them.I will say that viewers have truly voted for this film without under influence of big & popular name as it usually happens.Like godfather.Godfather is nice film but not nice enough to give points above 9 to it.	10
 One of My Top 10 of All Time		10
 get busy living or get busy dying		10
 Very Moving! Makes you appreciate Freedom and Friendship	Very few movies that made me cry ... and (The Shawshank Redemption) is certainly one of them. I remember when I first went to see this movie in my freshman year in college. The movie made me appreciate freedom and true friendship.Very powerful picture indeed and each actor deserved an Oscar for their great performance. It is sad that the movie did not get the true scale of recognition it deserved, but being on the IMDb top 250 movies of all time based on people's votes is a great way to show the well earned appreciation.If you did not watch this movie yet, then you missed a lot!	10

 Hope is a good thing and good thing never dies		10
 Meaningful movie in cynical times	"Much has been written and praised (deservedly so) about ""The Shawshank Redemption."" The fact that it's #1 on this list gives me faith in humanity. Instead of talking about its obvious care with excellent writing, directing, editing and cinematography, I'll just say how much the film has meant to me personally. Its message of hope and, above all, perseverance, kept me going through many of life's travails. I think I responded to how it dealt with the day-to-day grind of life (albeit in dramatic fashion)and even the stress of boredom. The other thing it demonstrated was how profoundly one person can affect another without even saying much to them. After all, Andy and Red only have one true baring-their-souls conversation in 19 years together (One of the greatest scenes in the history of movies, by the way). Yet we are fully aware of how much these two meant to each other and how moved we are when they are reunited. It's a real spiritual journey (visually as well); almost like Red has died at the end (leaving Hell/Shawshank) and is reborn in Zihuatanejo (Heaven)to be rejoined with the one person who understands him. Just a marvelous, life-changing experience for me. My thanks to all who've supported and created this movie. It will live on and be remembered throughout the years as one of the pinnacles of human achievement."	10
 One of the best movies around	This is such a good movie, that even to this day, many years after it came out, I still cannot find a single person who does not like Shawshank redemption. Everything in this film is timed well. The story is excellent and flows with perfect timing and the editing between the sequences are great. The acting is great, and it keeps you interested from the first to the last frame. It also has a very clever plot. You are not 100% sure what Tim Robbins is up to and how he has escaped until much later. Great job by everyone from director, actors to script. Just the best in movie making.	10
 It's the small things that make it brilliant...	Why Shawshank Redemption isn't rated 9.9/10 is beyond me.What has caused me to reflect and comment on this film is the small things...99.9% of movies miss them. A movie is a photographic montage of images with sound and is meant to represent a story. Humans have always enjoyed stories from time immemorial huddled around fires in caves to modern things like FaceBook or YouTube, it's all about stories.Shawshank has many small instances that Frank Darabont included like when Red leaves a small note to Andy with a free poster when he returns from the hospital/isolation. Another small instance is when Andy gives Red the harmonica, it could easily not have been filmed but it touches everyone with its deeper meanings. It's a collage of many small instances that make it meaningful and memorable, over and over again.I am convinced that's why everyone loves this movie and watch it repeatedly, it's the small things that touch you. How many movies have given you the most important small message of all...of hope...it's the most powerful of goals we can have, hope really sets you free.	10
 So good, I watched it without the sound!	I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!	10
 One In a Million Movie		10
 Simply the best!!!		10
 A Beautifully beautified movie	"I don't easily remember the names of actors of Hollywood movies, neither do I ""ever"" take the time off, writing comments on any movie, but for this movie i ""have"" to do it all.The whole way of presenting this movie has been outstanding, i.e. from the beginning to the end. Great performances (Tim Robbins & Freeman Qualifying as one my favorite actors). The whole presentation has been very apt to the movie. But what is important is the strong message this movie transcends, i.e. of Hope, is truly recommendable.This movie deserves an intent watch by ""all"". Do take you some time off to watch the movie,if not twice, be it once."	10
 In my top ten	This, for me, is film at it's best. The acting, (Tim Robbins, in particular, is amazing. Morgan Freeman is his usual wonderful self also.) the screenplay, the production, the...well, all of it! I could rave about it until I'm blue in the face, but I'll spare you (and myself) that. I must have watched it over a dozen times now, and with every viewing I still get as caught up in it as I did the first time I saw it. For me, that's one of the marks of a special film. I'm don't really want to use the term 'uplifting' yet again, but it is the best way to describe it. Highly recommended.	8
 Excellent cinema, right out of the heart	When you look at IMDb's top 250 you see many famous and ambitious films like Star Wars, The Godfather, The Lord of the Rings and others. Not saying that these movies are bad (they are actually quite brilliant) they were made famous because of the publicity and the abilities these films had in the time. Star Wars started the sci-fi age, The Godfather made people interested in the secret society of the Mafia and Lord of the Rings brought life into the fantasy genre again. But what really made these sublime films so popular was the publicity and the fantastic special effects which costed certain amounts of money. In 1994 Frank Darabont decided to have a go on one of Stephen King's novels, not knowing what would happen. They made a film that is honest and that contains (on the contrary to Star Wars etc.) a vital lesson, a meaning and a message to all who watch it.This movie is redefining cinema. No explosions. No heart-stopping excitement. No, it's pure poetry, music and sublime acting. The overwhelming and intriguing story introduces banker Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who was falsely convicted for a double life sentence in the heavily guarded establishment of Shawshank Prison. His life must go on and he makes friends with other inmates like Red (wonderfully acted out by Morgan Freeman) and Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore brings tears to your eyes). Warden Norton (played immensely evil by Bob Gunton) and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) don't make Andy's life comfortable in the prison, but with Andy's unique skills he manages to win their attention and gratitude.This film has some terrific moments like the helicopter shot over the Shawshank Prison and the stunningly beautiful scene where Andy locks himself up in the Warden's office and plays Mozart to all the inmates. Morgan Freeman's raw voice makes this moment more powerful than any other moment in any other movie I ever saw. At the release of the film, people criticised the film harshly and wasn't a big hit, certainly not at the box-office. But when the film appeared in the stores it became an enormous hit. And until this day, for over 4-5 years now I believe, it stands on the second place in the top 250, one place away from The Godfather.This is a film you have to see once in your life!	10
 Inspiration perfected	To be honest, I enjoy reading a good novel more than watching a film. You usually get far more character development than in a movie (e.g. Puzo's The Godfather).But not with Shawshank. This is the closest thing film has to a perfect story. The characters, pacing, plot, monologues and every other element contribute to an inspirational yarn with a fulfilling ending. Brook's suicide is the only film scene that has ever moved me to tears, and if you watch just one film in your life - let it be this. Not a film which others have tried to mimic for a good box office, e.g. LOTR: The Return of the King, The Godfather, but an original, stand-alone film that, in my opinion, will never be surpassed in quality	10
 Not Just Another Prison Film......		10
" moving and emotionally impactful(if you liked ""The Green Mile"" you will like this movie)"		10
 Great movie, Great Actors, Great Story	"This is one of the best movies ever made. Not really because it's really really good but because everyone likes it! I can't think of anyone who doesn't like this movies, young, old, male, female and over the entire globe! Good Work! It's a story about a man (Tim Burton) who is cent to jail for a crime he didn't commit (the murder of his wife and lover). In jail he meets good and bad people like always. One of them is Morgan Freeman. He is the guy who can get you anything you want. Because Tim Burton is innocent and a very intelligent guy he is desperately trying to find a way out of this jail. The relationship between Tim Burton and the rest of his jail-mates can be touching but also horrible and with some violence. This is a great ""feelgood"" movie about hope, love, hate and freedom!"	8
 Not quite great, but still compelling		8
 I watch it twice a year at least!	In the far western reaches of south west Wales I was lucky to be born to a father who had immaculate taste in film. At the tender age of 14, when I started to understand the complexity of human emotion I was introduced to this beautiful film. I remember the first time I sat and viewed the film, my father put the VHS in the video player and left me alone to begin my relationship with this film, from the age of 14 I reckon I must have watched this old film twice a year since and every time I still think this is probably the best film I have ever seen.Just thought I'd express a little of how I feel about this film, hope you don't mind.Al	10
 A movie like this, has never been done...	Hope is a good thing, and this movie can teach you about hope and no fear about to be prisoner of you own freedom.

Hope is a good thing, and this movie can teach you about hope and no fear about to be prisoner of you own freedom.	10
 Why the ending is so moving	I myself, like most people, love this movie and whenever it got to the end where you see Andy and Red smiling and embracing on the beach it always sent chills through my soul, but I realized that in addition to that sequence, where not a word is spoken between the two men, it's that 'deep blue ocean' that makes the ending so dramatic. I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things.	10
 Thank You So So Much To Anybody Involved.........	I am a 38 Years old man from england who works for the second biggest oil company in the world.........I have : lovely family......great friends.....good job.......The film is perfect time and time again every time you watch it !!! Talking Points , Settings & locations , Actors , So much feeling , fantastic score , and everybody involved in the production produced a masterpiece..........Extra special thanks to Frank Darabont ( i sincerely hope you are very happy and everything in your life is good )..............A total must have in the collection.............Thank you Trev	10
 A modern masterpiece	Andy (superb Tim Robbins) is condemned to stay all his life in prison due to two murders he has not done. There, he will meet Red (Morgan Freeman, impressive, these is one of the best relation love/friendship of all the movies I've ever seen). Red understand perfectly Andy and guides him at the first moments, as we see Andy from Red's eyes, his loyalty and admiration. We understand all these only by his looks and his moves, in one of the best parts of Freeman. Robbins play the part of a distant character, brave, righteous, intelligent, but as everyone, weak, frightened. It's like an angel in the depht of hell. The hardness of the prison and the corruption of the prison system is perfectly told to us by Darabont perfectly. Its realism is sometimes disgusting and the hardest scenes touches you at the depht of your heart. The film has a very high dramatic part, but in any moment becomes too sweety. Its wonderful dialogues, its magnificent study of characters and their psychologies, the charisma of Robbin's character, well absolutely everything helps that this film becomes part of the selected group of every time masterpieces. There are two scenes that I've loved a lot. The one where, Andy is able to listen, relaxed to a Mozart's Opera in the director prison's office (although being in prison, at that moment, Andy is free). And the other where, one of the prisoners, being very old and having spend almost all his life in prison, commits suicide as he cannot get used to a life in freedom. However, despite all the hardness and the few holes to hope that there's in the movie, at the end there's always a little ray of light. The Shawshank Redemption is that, a chant for life, for our dreams... a masterpiece.	10
 10 out of 10	"This is one of the best movies about ""friendship"" I've ever seen, also one of the best prison movies. I found it better than Robert Redford's ""CASTLE"". Morgan Freeman was perfect as usual and I can say that Tim Robbins reached the top of his performance and also his career. I wish this couple come together for another movie, the kind of it is not important I'm sure the spectators will have the same taste as before. I watched most of the films of Morgan Freeman and I can say this was the best of his, normally he prefers to play in films like ""Seven"",""Kiss the girls"",""Along came a spider"",... but I think he should think again that which kind of his films stay at the top of the charts..."	10
 Incredibly Powerful Film	"Undoubtedly one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The outstanding performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me with feelings so profound of being in that prison with them. Be warned that the first half of the film is visually and psychologically confronting.The film deals with fundamental themes of friendship and hope whilst delivering some very powerful social commentary. I am left questioning the state of our justice system. We lock away these ""threats to society"", alienate them and subject them to the most hostile and unnatural of environments. Then when they have served their life terms, we throw them back into society with the expectation for them to live normally and abide by values never once upheld or taught in their filthy prison cells. The Shawshank Redemption tells a very powerful story. A story that made me laugh and cry. It ignited just about every human emotion I could possibly experience in just over a two hour period of time.A truly amazing film, 10 out of 10 from me!"	10
 Old fashioned and entertaining? Sure. Great? No way.		8
 Excellent Film. A Powerful Drama	"Ten Thumbs Up if I had them. Incredible story, incredible cast. I would rate this as probably the best film I have ever seen and I have probably seen it a hundred times on cable. I would have to say this would be Morgan Freemans best performance out of all of his films. There should have been an Oscar for him. This film definitely beat out ""Million Dollar Baby"" for which he ultimately and finally received his first Oscar. The Academy wasn't all there when ""Shawshank"" deserved its due. Robbins played a great part in this film and did an excellent job however Freeman carried the film. A true drama that shows the bond of two people in horrible circumstances. Yes, this one is one to own, if you don't have it...buy it. You wont be disappointed."	10
 A great movie!	What I can say is this is a really great movie. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. You will succeed in the end. And also be ready at any time.Maybe it is because of language problem, I don't grasp it very well in the beginning. But step by step, I understand it. And in the end, I understand it and especially the result is out of my expectation that doesn't happened in the movies I have ever seen in the past. And also the performance skill is another thing I like it. They are good actors. And this is the movies that seldom take man-women sensation as topic, but still give people good feelings.Great movie encourage you while entertaining you!	10
" How would you define ""human""?"		10
 best film of all time	The Shawshank Redemption as a film is the most powerful and moving films I have seen and regard it as the best of all time yes there are many grate film out there many that are over looked by many people but as this film has shown box office ratings mean very little in the grand stage time a film that ca be classed as a true classic is one like this thats stands the test of time with grate acting and filming this one move people in ways other films can only hope to do. An it transcends all ages and class with a true hart felt tale of two men over coming adversity in a truly horrible place like the Shawshank prison in this way it moves me to think how would i cope in that place if i could at all stand that kind of life for that long but it has a lighter side to it as Andy get one over the Worden and escapes the cells to freedom	10
 The Greatest Movie Ever To Be Told On Film	Shawshank Redemption, based on a short story by Stephen King, is about a man named Andy who is sent to jail after being convicted of killing his wife and lover He adapts to jail and is planning something big - all through the film, clues are given as to what he is doing as he takes advantage of certain privileges he has.He makes friends with people in jail, and goes through his daily life. Hope is all he can hold on to, count on, and rely on. Through years he figures a way to end all of it. The story fallows himself and friends as they try to rid themselves of an underlying feeling - a feeling of always being trapped. They hated the walls of the jail. They've grown used to them. And they love them. But not Andy.Everything about this movie is amazing. Screenplay, cinematography,acting, production... its simply one of the best films off all time.	10
 Inspirational		10
 It took me while to come around, but this is one of the best!	"I rarely post comments on movies unless I, {A) Really love it, (B) Really hate it. This falls in the 'really love' category. The first time I watched this picture, I thought it was great, but much to dark and emotional, and contained unnecessary violence/sexuality. After viewing it 2 or 3 times, I finally understand why this movie is so highly ranked by IMDb regulars, and I also have come to understand why the scenes of violence and brutality toward Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) were included in this film. I also understand why James Whitmore's character Brooks Hatlen behaved the way he did. It was all the nastiness that happened to people we really like that makes the victory complete at the end. 5 years ago I would have called The Shawshank Redemption an overrated, self-indulging unnecessarily dark picture deserving a rating of 5 or perhaps 6 at best. Now that the move is nearly 12 years old, and now that I've watched it enough to finally ""get it"", I must agree with the masses and score this with a 9+. One of the best movies ever made and certainly the best of the Stephen King adaptations. How could I have been so obtuse?"	9
 Best Film ever	"Nothing in the history of the entertainment industry compares to this films wonderful, inspiring and completely unforgettable ending. The title of the film is the on criticism you could make of this masterpiece. If you talk to any group of people about ""what's the best film ever made"" you're almost guaranteed that someone in the group will mention this film.The script is superb and both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do make it a moving story of friendship, dignity, and most importantly hope. It's one of those films where you feel obliged to recommend it to everyone you know. Theirs something so special about this film and you shouldn't be allowed to talk about films if you've missed this gem."	10
 An Amazing and Emotional Film, one of the very best.	This movie has to be one of the very best films i've seen in my lifetime. I am usually not that fond of drama films but the portrayal of the characters and the amazing script made it a perfect translation from the Stephen King book. Morgan Freeman gives one of his best performances in this movie and actually makes you believe him as a jail smuggler, better than Chris Rock in the Longest Yard ever did. The cinematography is brilliant showing the sheer scale of this old decaying prison. The movie may not have received any Academy Awards (the show was stolen by Forrest Gump that year) but it still remains to be one of the best films around. If your looking for a deeper movie more than you're typical action flick, this will provide what you were looking for. Go out and rent it, heck go and buy it because you'll want to watch it time and time again.	9
 The best movie ever made	I think the shawshank redemption is the best film ever made. It is considered as a drama, but in my opinion this fantastic and entertaining movie has no genre. In my country (Argentina) not a lot of people has seen it but i'm trying to change that situation by recommending it to everybody. Despite not having a great success while it was at the theaters, now with the VHS and the DVD, a lot of people is having a chance to enjoy 142 minutes of greatness and get away from their boring lives at least for just a while. I find the twist that the story makes when Andy escapes from shawshank as simply perfect and unexpected. The only thing i consider that is wrong on the film is that when the movie is over you want to see more and you can't see more because the movie ended and ended perfectly, but i think that with a masterpiece like the shawshank redemption not even 10 hours of movie would be enough. Well i've got a lot more things to say but i don't know really how to express myself. So if haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? just put your shoes on a go running to the video and i know you'll enjoy it. I would like to know who is Allen Greene, i'll get very happy if you e mail me back telling me who he is. Simply the best movie ever made.	10
 Simply the BEST !	This is the only film I have seen more than once. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Morgan Freeman takes the first place and also Tim Robbins shows a great performance. There are many memorable scenes in the film. This film can change your point of view for the life, it has that power. It teaches not to give up. Thanks to Stephen King (short story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption) and Frank Darabont (screenplay) and all others who made that fantastic film. I can not call it just a film. It should be the number one on the list and it will be! As it says 'Fear can hold you prisoner hope can set you free'.	10
 Simply the most awesome movie of all times		10
 The single greatest masterpiece of all time.	"I am new to commenting on movies, so maybe I shouldn't have started with trying to put the Shawshank Redemption into words. The themes of hope, depression, friendship, greed, and triumph connect with the best acting I have ever seen in a movie. The actors are so good, you begin to look at Morgan Freeman in real life as ""Red"" and Tim Robbins as ""Andy"". The humor is ever present, such as conversations held by the inmates. But perhaps the very best thing for an average viewer is the constant surprises. I'm not talking about monsters jumping from trees, I'm talking about how every time the movie starts to seem to get slow BAM! something happens that represents one of the themes. If you have not seen this movie, maybe because the fact that it is a ""prison movie,"" or maybe because it is now eleven years old, you have missed out on a life experience. It is my favorite movie of all time and always will be. The 9.1 rating on IMDb is so well earned and underrated."	10
 Does this film deserve it's praise?		10
 No body can tell you the story, you have to see tho movie!	The first time i read about this movie, I was sure that this movie is overrated, But after seeing him, I am sure that this movie is underrated It is the best movie ever. It is about hope, passion, love and friendship. I do not think that Hollywood can produce an other movie like that, it one in century. The acting was GENIUS, The script was the best ever, The director was a maestro. A lot of Novel-Moivis not good as the novel, I did not read Stephen King's Novel, but I am sure that the movie is much better. believe me if you saw the movie you will not be able to forget it. Believe me when I say that you will not able to talk after seeing the movie at least for 20 minutes, and the first thing you will say 'Why this sons of bitches did not give it Best Motion Picture'. Well Forrest Gump won it - and I love this movie- but believe they do not deserve it. See the movie, I am sure that this will change your view to the future, to the hope, and to the friendship.	10
 The Reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars	This movie is one of the greatest I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman gives an unbelievable performance in this work. The direction of it is exquisite (and gives much to Tim Robbins character, I know he is a good actor, but the direction gives so much more to him).  The soundrack is unparalleled and the story is exquisite (thanks to Stephen King).  I have seen many greats, Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cuckoo's Nest, The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now....etc. This movie is fantastic, and the fact it didnt' win (or even get nominated) for an Oscar is the reason I don't pay attention to the Oscars anymore. This movie is fantastic, and an artistic triumph. I have no respect for the Academy for ignoring this flick.	
 Powerful, Put It Up for #1	'94...the year the greatest movie to exist on this site was created...to bad you movie-goers disagree. Godfather Part I is a classic, but get real you can't defy this movie.  It may get slow at points but it overcomes that with amazing cleverness and a few tricks up the director's sleeve. If you see or have seen this movie you will find or know that this movies brings out many surprises.	10
 excellent emotional rescue	This movie is excellent in every way you look at it. Even the ways you don't know about it is excellent.  Every time I think about this movie it makes me want to watch it again. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give one heck of a performance. A brilliant masterpiece to show how cruel the system was and how they can take away your freedom with flimsy evidence. (It was back in the 30's, it's probably the best justice system they had).  And how cruel the prison system was back in the day. 2nd all time favorite move. (1st being Platoon).	
 one to watch	One of the best films I've ever seen you just have to see it for yourself and you will know why, However if you're a big Sly or Arnold fan, you may not like it as it doesn't have any exploding cars, plus it has a lot of dialogue and some words with more than two syllables	10
 A brilliant movie	I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on tv tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. I'll certainly watch this movie again.	10
 IMDB #2 quality movie of all time, is truly #1 for many	"This movie was far ahead of its time. It had the best picture, soundtrack, brilliant acting, decriptive characters, masterful storyline as in example illustrated the ideal prison life to the bone,  and was first of its kind to come out with a unbelivable(shocking) ending. If you haven't watched this movie yet, you are depriving your eyes from the ""amazing"" it craves. The ending is so beautiful, one can't dare to imagine."	
 One of the brightest gems from the Hollywood treasures	I have come here, writing my review, after just watching this wonderful film. My soul is full! Overflowing tears of joy down my face. Therefore, I am afraid that the tremendous emotion tremble will not let me be objective. However, I really do not care; I'm just writing to share with all of you the greatness of this movie. A movie that brings to screen hope, despair, true friendship, perseverance and human nature like no one before. If you just are reading reviews to see if the film is worthwhile, well don't lose more time and watch it!	10
 Wonderful Movie	"This is a movie to be watched over and over.  Each time I get a little bit more out of it.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have a great chemistry together.  Many people do not realize that this movie was based on a Stephen King (one of my favorite authors) novel, ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"", especially since it is not of the horror/sci-fi genre. I was really glad to see this one at the top of the list."	10
 Perfecta	Run Tim Robbins's name in the database, and I don't think you'll find that he's starred in too many movies worth watching.  Generally, most movies he's in have the subtlety of a ball peen hammer across your forehead.  This movie atones for a thousand sins.  Carefully written, deliberately paced, lovingly acted, this film brings you in and leads you to the light on the other side. Nothing is forced, but not a single plot thread is left dangling. Hollywood needs a lot more movies like this one.  See it twice.	10
 a really good movie	The first time I saw this movie I loved it. But I loved it more and more every time I saw it again. If you want to have a good and entertaining time watching a movie, buy this movie.	10
 Outstanding!!!	This movie is flawless in my opinion.  Every situation and character are so intricately woven, there is no wasted celluloid here.  Every aspect of the movie, from acting, directing, and all factors that make up a masterpiece are in top form.  It is truly a testament to the spirit of man and how each one of us handles what life throws at us in our own way.  If you are feeling down, give it a watch and it's hard not to be inspired.  I find more meaning with each viewing.  It's one of the few movies that I've not grown tired of watching again and again.  Once again, in my opinion, it's one of the best!	10
 Captivating, breathtaking and compelling...		
 Simply the Best!	This is simply the best film ever made.  It just goes to show that you don't need mutli-million pound special effects, and a number one theme tune to make a good film.	
 One of the best	Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life changes drastically when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy, with the help of his friend Red, the prison entrepreneur, turns out to be a most unconventional prisoner.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in one of the best movies ever made	
 hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things		10
 Excellent film	This is one of my favourite films ever. Why? Well a lot of reasons really. But mostly because of the plot. It contains just about everything needed for a film to really work like art. The actors are superb (note: Freeman - why he didn't receive an Oscar for this one, I'll never understand). The story is great, and written by my all time favourite writer - Stephen King (Misery, Dolores Claiborne, The Shining, Carrie and more), which are all among my absolute top films. Try them out. I promise you all several great movie-moments.	9
 I'd give this movie 11 if I could	This film is hard, exciting, realistic, beautiful and surprising. The Shawshank Redemption completely absorbs you and constantly throws you back and forth between joy and sadness. It simply blew me away, and if it was possible, I would give it 11 without thinking twice.	10
 A Very Good Movie		
 Best Movie Ever	"An inspirational and warm-hearted movie that almost put me to tears at the end. This is one of those rare movies that gets better and better the more times you watch it. The great lines in this movie just made it that much better. The friendship that was portrayed by the main characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were totally convincing. It's such an involving movie that grabbed me from the start, and the great music didn't hurt either. Don't miss this powerful prison drama that  shows that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things."""	10
 Great, uplifting drama, with one flaw...	"I'm sorry, I can't buy these guys as criminals, and that ruined the ""suspension of disbelief"" for me. Otherwise, an excellent story."	7
" ""Get Busy living, or get busy dying."""		10
 Time Flies	One interesting thing about this movie is how quickly it seems to pass.  The movie could have continued this story for another 2 or 3 hours and I don't think it would have lost my interest.  I think just because normal people like this movie is no reason to lower its rating with the 'movie critics'. The best movie ever???  Definitely.  Everything else pales in comparison.	10
 A divine movie experience -- and I was watching it on TV!	I won't repeat the ravings by others about this Movie (yes, that's a capitalized M!) I'll just share with you my experience watching it on CNN last month. I'm a graduate student, and midterm week was approaching. I constantly said to myself: Ok, I'll go to the library at the next commercial break ... but without me knowing it my butt was glued to the seat after the first 5 minutes... and by and by I forgot I was watching a film. Finally when it was over I was left tearful and speechless. It was that powerful an experience. I even feel that my life is enriched so much more after watching the film. Those 3 hours are worth every second of it, I can tell you that!	10
 Over rated	The acting is adequate, the story is adequate, but why all the fuss?It sometimes baffles me why some movies get such high ratings when they are really only run of the mill.This is not that bad a film, just seen it all before.	3
 If you can say overrated, I can say Shawshank Redemption		6
 I have never seen anything quite as touching as The Shawshank Redemption	I have been waiting a long time to watch this movie and I couldn't be more pleased. The Shawshank Redemption is something like I have seen before. The story was brilliant from beginning to end and it is definitely something that I will never forget. The acting was wonderful, the story was genius, and the whole movie was just so beautifully done. It is now, perhaps, my favorite movie and I think that it is absolutely worth watching.	10
 May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face and may the wings of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars.		10
 A Timeless Classic	By far, one of the best movie adaptations of a Stephen King novel to date.Perhaps a bit maudlin and sappy at times, it is an age old story of friendship, hope and redemption.A formula that head been done time and time again.What differentiates this film is that it doesn't get weighed down in that stereotypical quagmire.A brilliantly adapted screenplay, that conveys what daily life in prison is like.Not in the cartoonish manner of say, Jailhouse Rock.It is a journey into the dark, hopelessness of an evil institution resplendent with corruption, violence, and desperation.This is the rare Hollywood production that not only stirs up just about every human emotion, it reaches into your soul.All of the acting is superb, particular Tim Robbins.I suggest you read the book first, then watch the movie.	9
 Baffling	A flawless film. But every time I watch it I still get upset that Thomas Newman didn't win the Oscar for his flawless score. And all of his others as well.	10
 The best movie still to day	"To powarful movie please watch it. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	10
 amazing	One word amazing! so so so great love this cant wait for more	8
 i love this movie	I love this movie i have been waching it since i was a kid we used to have a vcr growing up amd my mom and my sister would watch this my mom loves it to it puts her to sleep and no movie does that	10
 masterpiece	A great movie that gives you the power to bear all the challenges in life for the sake of hope. There are some scenes that hit the person right from the heart. They have perfect lines. For this, I think it is number 1 in imdb. There is friendship, freedom and, above all, joy in a life that no one can touch. Some birds should not be caged. It's not my favorite movie, but it's always in my top 10 list.	10
 A genius screenplay	The screenplay for Jay makes your brain tickle and it keeps your mind busy for a long time	9
 How was this that great?	A movie based on a Stephen King book could be great or awful. Thankfully this was amazing.	10
 The best film ever	I watch it all over again & again & enjoy it as it is the first time. It is very humane & full of life & philosophy.	10
 From my favorites movies...	It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.	9
 My take on this film	I watched this film two times. I liked the idea that Andy Dufresne story is the one that impacts Red to change. I find the narration very much needed in the story, and this story is to me about hope and finding your way into leaving a mark on this planet.	8
 A Rare kind of Masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. This is a film that focuses on what happens to people when imprisoned. The different experiences had amongst each character are all representative of what kind of person the character is. This movie has gorgeous cinematography and classic dialogue, this paired with the peaceful yet ominous score make an amazing atmosphere. On top of all these technical marvels you also have one of the best stories ever told. The Shawshank Redemption is truly a work of art.	10
 An Excellent Piece Of Art!	Gripping..Compelling!!In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.Though the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.	10
 About Patience	Andy, Vice President of Portland Bank gets accused for the death his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank jail where he copes with the new routine and make new friends. His only hope is to ever get out of the Shawshank jails	10
 review	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 One of My Favorite Films	"This is one of those films that I can watch over and over. It covers a period of Andy Dufresne's incarceration at Shawshank prison, which is a time span of about 20 years, and you would think that a prison film wouldn't be one that you want to watch over and over.... but the characters are so engaging, we feel like we come to know them, and we enjoy their company. None of the actors ever strike a false note. In a lot of films there are moments that don't ""ring true,"" when you can see the actor acting and in that moment, disbelief is suspended. Sometimes it happens so often that you're never really able to completely immerse yourself in the story. That never happens in Shawshank because the actors, the dialogue and the direction are perfectly crafted to create an environment that engages you in such a way that you're drawn into their world. Although I've watched this movie a dozen times, it never fails to draw me in and it feels like we're right there in Shawshank prison with our friends Red and Andy and Brooks. Truly a must-see."	10
 the best dramatic film you can ever sean	Its the story of hope. beautiful i can just say this about the story this film really had a lot of lessons for your life just see it and enjoy	10
 Old-school and full of hearts.	Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and defintely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!Oh and it's better than the novel.	9
 A good film to watch	Shawshank Redemption has superb performances, a good script and interesting story all leading to a deep emotional climax! One of the best film.	9
 A cinematic legend that will be remembered for centuries	After having seen the positive reviews for this film years ago, I finally decided to watch it. Going in with a critical mindset, I must say The Shawshank Redemption absolutely lives up to the legendary reputation it has created. Though the plot is fairly straightforward, it is a true roller-coaster of emotions. Every character is introduced so perfectly, that a few minutes is all they need to leave a lasting and powerful impression.Especially powerful is the ongoing narration by Red, connecting himself to you, and a perfect balance between showing and telling. Both Brooks and Tommy's deaths were heart-wrenching, while Andy and Red's escapes were heartwarming; a true roller-coaster of pain and bliss. And as if that wasn't enough, the final sequence of Red's journey to meed Andy again elevates that level of emotion all the way up to the highest degree. Every actor in this movie executed their role almost perfectly, and this will certainly be a film I will remember in my grave.	10
 Very Good	This Video is Veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyy Gooooooooooooood . Thank you for taking the trouble to help me.I do appreciate it.	9
 Very good movie	Immensely enjoyed the movie! The acting was very good. It, also, helped me to view people in prison more compassionately. I loved Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in this. Morgan Freeman is an outstanding actor.	9
 You have to watch it	No matter how much i talk about this movie i wouldn't give it justice. The movie got nominated for a lot of awards won nothing but the people loved it its been the no. 1 movie of all times by over 2 million people votes the story the direction the actors it's a piece of work, it makes you angry, happy, emotional and inspiration.You should watch if you haven't already	10
 The Shawshank taken our mind	The movie Shawshank redemption is the one of the favourite films I ever watched. The slow base movie and climax attracted me to this movie this movie gives us a feel good impression. I suggest this movie to people those who ready to watch slow base and feel good movies	9
 Nice VERY	Old-school cinema, great down to the smallest detail, a story already made into a seventh art classic, an unbeatable directorial debut, and an ideal cast in a round film.	8
 strong beliefs	People have strong beliefs, as long as you want to do and adhere to, you will have a successful day. After watching this movie, I felt that I was full of longing for a better life.	9
 Brain burning and great scenario	290/5000Starting from Andy and Red, all actors played a wonderful role. And he made sure that this movie didn't come down first. I watched this movie too late. It was 2015. I had no opportunity to watch. And I watched it 3 times. Beer event and escape from the tunnel was very good. Hey Andy, why aren't you drinking a beer?	10
 Freedom		9
 I wish I could erase the memory of this film, and watch it again for the first time	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from there and that foundation is hope.This movie is a Christian movie and in the making is the christian act of redemption. Andy comes to Shawshank as a innocent outsider and he refuses to give up hope. He discovers the proof of his innocence but when warden erases evidence of his innocence Andy appears to come to the same institutional pessimism as his fellow prisoners. He returns to the cell and there appears to hang himself; that's when the unexpected occurs. Instead of finding Andy dead the cell is empty. It symbolizes new birth and his empty cell is an allusion of the empty tomb. Andy's escape is an echo of Jesus resurrection Well, one thing's for sure, this film inspired me to try life again. There was this film and many other films which I would watch over and over again, just to get a glimpse of what could happen if I just tried again. I clung to the idea that happiness is inside each of us, we just have to work for it to get it. We also just have to bide our time to get there, it doesn't happen over night. And it doesn't always last, there will be bad days when the darkness returns, but they will pass as well. I relate to Brooks when he got into the outside world, feeling like he didn't belong and feeling empty. I'm still like that at times, not all the time. I'm still wanting to end up on the beach, sanding down the wood on a boat, metaphorically of course. I'll get there, perhaps one day.	10
 .	"""Redemption by Shawshank"" turns life into a cruel choice. Shawshank's redemption is something we have to remember repeatedly in our simple lives. Believing in yourself, not giving up hope, giving up effort, and waiting patiently for your own glory in life, is Shawshank's redemption."	10
 Shawshank review	This film is something else, the acting, the story line everything about it is perfectly well balance just like a fine wine or a perfect life.	9
 Favorite	My Favorite Movie Ever, I Watched It At Least 3 Times !	9
 Outstanding....	Just watch it, you will enjoy every bit of it. Amazed by the twist and the hard work of the actors.	9
 Prefect	Heartbreaking my all time favourite. The movie is just amazing. Narration is clearly the best!	10
 Just perfect	"If I was asked about my favorite film, I would think for a rather long time about the answer. There are many well-rounded films that I enjoy, so choosing the best of them would be a complicated task. However, if I was asked about the films that I would name among the best, I would almost immediately recall ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a film proving that when a person has will power, a dream, and persistence, nothing is impossible."	
 Perfect	Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free. Some people's wings are so bright that even the darkest prison in the world cannot encircle them for a long time. This film tells a simple story, a redemption, in exchange for freedom. Besides the belief drive him to do so. This film is moving, it also makes many people grow up.	10
 One of King's most successful film adaptations.		10
 Fascinating	Hands down one of the best movies i've ever seen. I was glued to the screen for the entirety of this film and invested fully in to the story within. Amazing.	10
 I feel a lot	"Different people may see the same video differently. Regarding my current inability to change the status quo, the deepest feeling after watching this film is that talent and perseverance are the best way for anyone to be free in any situation.The young banker in the film, with his proficient knowledge of bank finance, not only won his life safety and a little freedom in prison, but also gained material and spiritual benefits for his inmates. It is also because of his mastery of finances that the actor finally defeats the cruel and insidious warden in the end and gives himself material freedom.On the other hand, look at the weekly application letter for six years, the application letter twice a week for N years, the tunnel that was dug out day by day with the stone axe that ""cannot dig a tunnel for 600 years,"" The sewer pipe smashed with stones, the rotten sewer with a length of 500 while vomiting and crawling ... all these draw a word deeply: perseverance.Anyone who wants to finally get the freedom under the blue sky and white clouds must have these two kinds of talents--excellent talent and tenacity."	10
 About lines.	Share some of the sentences in this movie.1.It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.2.Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.	10
 A great movie	Andy and Rhett's conversation is so classic. When Andy says he wants to go to a hotel on Mexico's Pacific coast to spend his life. How can it be said that Rhett did not believe it? A man sentenced to life in prison is daydreaming. This is the gap, the gap of thought, the gap of value. It is the gap between the world, that is why there will be winners and losers in this world, there will be the poor and the rich, there will be this story It is not terrible that people are trapped by high walls, because some people are not trapped. Feathery birds always belong to the sky, can not close. But if the mind is trapped in a wall, people are trapped in it.	10
 Great.	Great film. Wanted more action. Great plot. Great cast. Great A/V.	
 Tribute to freedom	"This film has always been regarded as a treasure by filmmakers in various countries and regions. If the re-evaluation of classic movies is regarded as an act that can't keep up with the trend, then I'm sorry, I'm late.To be honest, I used to scoff at these classic movies. I think that's just because they fit the appetite of the film festival judges, so they are popular with ordinary people.But on a boring night, I couldn't sleep, and opened it with a try mentality. In the following more than 100 minutes, I was deeply attracted by it.Red said hope is dangerous and the source of mental distress. He had been in the jail for thirty years, and he was indeed qualified to say so.Because from the day he came in, the warden said, ""Give your soul to God and your body to me."" Except for the cigarettes and poker cards with naked girls that he can get, any other changes in this dark Nothing seems to grow inside the high walls.But Andy told him, ""Remember, hope is a good thing-maybe even the best of the world. And good things never disappear.""So Andy was able to use two decades to dig a tunnel that Rhett thought could not be drilled for six hundred years. When he finally climbed out of the five hundred yards of foul-stained sewage pipe, standing in the pouring rain, he couldn't help but feel as if we saw faith pierce the dark curtain and hit a thunderbolt in the dark night. In the light, our cowardly souls appeared and shuddered under Andy's open arms."	10
 Masterpiece get busy living or get busy dying	This is not just a Prison film epic it is more than that - I feel its understated calling it a Masterpiece but it truly is. Rarely has a film stayed as long as it has at the top of the IMBD tree but there has been nothing since to compare. I have seen it a few times now and as I grow older it still feels as fresh watching again as it did the first time, only this time the way in which scenes are weaved together makes it even more enjoyable you watch and witness the characters grow and the story become more believable. How Prison would institutionalise and dehumanise a person and how that the main Character Andy Dufrane overcomes all this and brings hope - Its a masterpiece because you cannot watch it and feel for each character and see Red's redemption and come away feeling invigorated for the experience. The tarring of the roof, Brooks suicide the p\role hearings for Red and the most important part Hope - it truly inspires you feel that get busy living or get busy dying is such a powerful message in the end,.	10
 Eternal Hope	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.	10
 Nice movie	Nice movie and keep it up..I have never seen such an amazing film since i saw Shawshank Redemption.	8
 A classic prison break	The ingenuity of a prisoner who displayed this film is really wrapped well. Behind his cold gaze, there was a surprising action.	9
 10 facts about The Shawshank Redemption	"1. Morgan Freeman hurt his arm throwing the baseballEarly in the film, Andy meets his soon-to-be best friend Red as he's playing catch with some other ""innocent"" inmates. The scene took a lengthy nine hours to shoot, and while Freeman never complained, he did show up the following day with his arm in a sling.2. The stream was worse than the sewersIn what's probably the most famous scene in the film, Andy crawls through 500 yards of sewage before emerging a free man on the other side. ""We got a local chemist to test the quality of the water,"" said production designer Terence Marsh on the DVD, ""and he said this water is absolutely lethal."" ""It was cow country,"" Robbins grimaced, ""enough said."" The only reason the actor agreed to do the scene was that there was a hot shower nearby. Funnily enough, the actual 'sewage' was just water, sawdust and chocolate syrup.3. Freeman's real-life son has a cameoRed pleads for parole multiple times throughout the film, and we are shown a picture of what a young Red (and a young Morgan Freeman) might have looked like. The mugshot bears a strong resemblance for a reason: The picture on the parole papers is actually Freeman's son, Alfonso. That's not his only presence in the film either; he's also a con shouting, ""Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! We're reeling 'em in!"".4. Red and Andy don't meet at the endRather than the happy ending where Red and Andy reunite on the beach, Darabont wanted to end it when Red gets on a bus and goes out to look for him. In later interviews, Darabont said the ending that he'd envisioned was more open, ambiguous note. The production company, Castle Rock, pushed for the ending we got in the film.5. Freeman was always choice #1A number of actors were considered to play the part of Red, including big names such as Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman and Robert Redford. In the novella, Stephen King originally wrote the part as a white Irishman. Before the film's production, however, Darabont already knew he wanted Morgan Freeman.6. Cruelty to maggotsFor scenes involving Brooks crow, the American Humane Association was brought in to monitor the scene. Ironically enough, it wasn't the crow they ended up having issues with. Instead, the AHA objected to the use of a live maggot during a scene where Brooks feeds the bird, citing that it was cruel to kill it. The maggot that made it into the film was already dead of natural causes.7. The 40 minutes that took 3 weeksMorgan Freeman recorded the complete voice-over for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before filming even began. This was used as a guide track to establish the rhythm of each scene. There was a slight hiss on the track, however, and the sound engineers were unable to remove it. Instead, they had to re-record the entire thing - and this time it took three weeks.8. Solitary RefinementIt's hard to feel in-character when you're playing an inmate if you've never been convicted. For some pretty hardcore method acting, Tim Robbins requested time in solitary confinement to better get a feeling of what the experience is like. ""I wanted to go in for a day or two,"" Robbins said in an interview, ""but they wouldn't let me for security reasons."" He was in solitary for a couple of hours.9. That voiceMorgan Freeman has graced many films with his famous voice, from The Lego Movie to March of the Penguins. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was actually his first time narrating. ""He's got the muse in him,"" said Robbins. Apparently the experience came very naturally to him!10. The sound of retributionThe sound effect used towards the end of the film when the corrupt Warden shoots himself is actually the same sound effect as the man stamping 'approved' on Red's paper during his parole hearing. Now that's the sound of justice being served!"	10

 Truly corresponding to the title - The best movie ever made	As a person who loves watching movies of different categories and genres, I could say that this movie could truly represent our planet earth in a right way to aliens (If they exist). With this, I would like to underline that this is a film that shows our humanity and the fact that a person could have patience of the highest level.I would recommend to everyone to watch this amazing masterpiece, even if you are not a cinema lover or as interested in cinematography as I am.	10
 Great movie	Great movie. A must watch. Really enjoyed it. Great acting and everything. Hollywood needs to make more movies like this.	10
 Must Watch	Gripping, very good movie.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes.	10
 The Greatest	No no fucin movie can be compared to this one. I'm out of mind man! The greteast movie ever undoubtedl!	10
 The reason for movies	A masterpiece. No other words has to be said. A pure original masterpiece.	10
 good stuff	Great movie. Great acting and storyline. Excellent plot twist	9
 This is really awesome movie	OMG! This is really very good movie. Watch again...	10
 Knowledge changes destiny	"Andy said 'There are places in the world that aren't made out of stones .There is something inside that they can't get to ,that they can't touch .'This is the best movie I've ever seen, calm and warm, every details, every dialogue, go straight to my heart, every line is classic! Knowledge changes destiny. Close to the red ink near the black! Water can carry a boat and overturn it!The self-seeking life is not just a dream, just how to do it. Whatever the end, the process is important. A long road to freedom, a deep soul washing, an immortal inspirational classic,"" Hope ""follows God's will to sleep in the hollowed-out Bible inside, clinging to Andy's tall body, prostrate in a 500-yard sewer, and finally, the only dirty road to send Andy to the beautiful new world."	10
 Hey look what's on	One of those movies that always seems to be on some channel and I always end up watching it. A movie almost entirely comprised of men enduring prison and corruption and surviving rape and attempted murder offers something surprising, hope.	9
 Awesome Movie	An experience you'll gonna remember forever.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.	9
 Perfect movie	Love this movie tune in guys. This is the type of movie you need popcorn and candy and drinks for lol.	
 All time top	One of the best escapes of all times! It's worth to see it again and again with firends and family!	10
 one of the best	Anytime i see this movie its like first time .. can't be old never	10
 The Shawshank Redemption(1994)	One of the few movies that always makes me cry. I love the role of Freeman and the ending (without making a spoiler) is nice, for a change	9
 With one word, perfect.	A timeless script and acting.The masterpiece that thrives the cinema into a new era.	10
 How Wonderful		10
 This will always be in the top ten of all time	Absolute classic movie, brilliant acting, well written and directed.	10
 A must see ...	I watched this movie when I was very young and I never understood its importance to me. I definitely, understand the movie better as an adult. I suggest watching it as a teen then again as an adult you will appreciate your freedom!!	10
 Tearjerker	An amazing movie that left me crying as I was leaving the movie theater.	9
 Fantastic	It makes you feel stuff. This movie makes you feel emotion. It's awesome, a classic, and really not that overrated	10
 the shawshank	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	9

 best movie in all time!	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles."	10
 One of the ALL TIME best Movies	Shawshank Redemption is one of my personal all time favorite films because of the dialogue, the detail, the acting, the emotion given off by the actors in each scene and all around the whole movie itself makes it a legend. The cast is perfect especially each role each actor and actress portrays is spot on and makes you shiver how well they are in their roles. I believe that all parents should have their kids watch this movie at least once in their young lives so they can see a true masterpiece at it's finest. Every part of the movie is breath-taking, amazing and just beautiful in its own way. There is not one thing I can complain about with this movie and you shouldn't either because it is just pure perfection in movie history. Best Movie I have watched in my whole life, nothing can beat it in my opinion.	10
 Best standalone movie ever made	Shawshank truly is the best-made standalone movie of all time.As much as I might like the extended Lord of the Rings trilogy more overall, as for singularly movies, nothing tops Shawshank.	10
 amazing		10
 Worth the watch!	Absolute Masterpiece of filmaking! loved every minute of it. the overall essence of hope and the ideas of freedom!	10
 what a movie i have watch.	"""Yes, sirOh yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.I mean, I learned my lessonI can honestly say that i am a changed man...That's God's honest truth.""and I got a wisdom that God's honest truth not necessarily be accepted by someone we trust.so, keep trying for the truth even someone reject it."	10
 It's good.	This movie... is overrated. It's a great movie, don't get me wrong, but it is NOT the greatest movie ever made. Still, definitely worth a watch.	8
 Best movie Ever!!!!!!	I'm 12 years old (don't tell my parents) and even though it doesn't have a full storyline and it's a bit long but I didn't get bored one bit. Great acting and great story. It should of won best picture.	10
 This movie is one of the best I have ever seen.	This movie is one of the best I have ever seen. Definitely everyone should watch this movie. Super good acting, gripping storyline and exciting surprises in the movie.	10
 One of my Top 10....	Shawshank Redemption has been in my top ten movies for a long long time. It's a beautiful story of hope. The filmmaking is utterly exquisite.	9
 Hope is a Dangerous thing maybe the best thing of all	This movie is a life changer. It can change the way of how you perceive the life one lives in this world. It really is a movie which helps you for redemption. It always provides motivation and hope no matter how many time i watch it. It really deserves it's first place in imdb.	10

 stands the test of time	Classic storytelling stellar cast a timeless piece of cinema that can be enjoyed and relate to a number of demographics the takeaway message of reaching for the humanity within each of us from our most basic needs while regarding the will to live is strong	9
 Brooks was here 😢	Best movie ever made. Based on a Stephen King short story. I've seen it at least 20 times. It never gets boring. It's just overwelming and sorrowful. It makes you sad, angry and happy at the same time. Never forget, there is hope.Believe in your dreams.	10
 Brooks was here.	"It can be said that Stephen King has come up with some of the best stories modern literature has to offer. The adaptation of his book ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" to the big screen is nothing short of marvelous. In fact, I do not think marvelous is the word I am looking for here, for this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. The acting, the directing, the cinematography and the editing are just brilliant. What can I even say about the storytelling? The best ever. Listen, I am not going to bore you by analysing all of the technical and practical achievements of this movie, but I will wholeheartedly encourage you to do yourself a favor and watch this movie, if you have not already done so. Bravo Frank Darabont, bravo."	10
 Not bad movie ..	"I would humbly suggest that before praising or damning the ""Shawshank Redemption"", that one take a considered look at the New York Times ""Best 1000 Films Ever Made"" list. Unfortunately, the guidelines of this site preclude me,oh gentle reader, from giving you the URL. One should be able to Google it, so all is not lost.The NYT was good enough to excerpt the list from Peter Nichols' The ""New York Times Guide to the 1,000 Best Films Ever Made"".What ? The ""Shawshank Redemption"" is not on this list, you say ?Perhaps, humble viewer, you haven't seen enough films of the first rank. But, have no fear, this is a remediable condition. But, be a dear and do try to see some of the movies on the list,please, before voting on this site. I really hate to see so many people make the mistake of voting for the wrong sort of movies onto the top 10 of IMDb's very interesting site. It's ever so declasse.Remember, an educated public is an informed public.Now, do your part."	7
 This is a bast moives I have ever seen	This is a bast moives I have ever seen .I watched a lot of moives . The moive is my favorite .	10
 Amazing movie!	This movie was great! I loved the character development throughout the movie. It's great to know that the film was later released a second time for a well deserved box-office success. The box-office flop from its initial release definitely doesn't even come close to the master piece this movie is! Definitely one of my top 10!	10
 Hands down to the best movie I've ever watched..	What to say about this movie. I still regret not watching it after several recommendations. This is a complete masterpiece. All the actors have done great job.Now talking about the movie it has a very deep message. It says hope is the thing a man should always have. Fear can hold you a prisoner but hope can set you free. And being free doesn't mean freedom from prison, but from negative thoughts that brought you down here. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shared a great bond of throughout the movie and we really do care about them. It is a masterpiece and one must watch it at least once in his/her life....	10
 Gem of cinema	If you are above 12 then I make sure that you heard this name once in your lifetime and if not then no harm but if you want to watch a true performance then just watch this one with patience.	10
 Most see!!!!!	Havent seen this movie, YOU NEED TO, Best movie of all time.	10
 nice movie	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	9
 Amazing!	This movie is very Amazing!The only other movie I have even seen That effects me as strongly is to kill a Mockingbird.	10
" ""Hope."""	This movie is probably my number one movie of all time. Everytime I watch it, I feel like I'm watching it for the first time again. This movie shows friendship, determination, and hope (the main theme of this movie). I could go on and on about how amazing this movie is, but I encourage you to see it for yourself and the beauty of it. You won't regret, definitely buy it!	10
 amazing	The BEST i like it cast and scenario its amazing i love it	9
 A Story of hope	It was shocking to know initially that this masterpiece was not accepted by audience when it was released.Well it was too ahead of it's time.It shows real character development ofRed...a unwise hothead kid to a wise man who accepted his wrong doing.What I like the mostwas its ability to tell an extraordinary story in a very pleasant and simple appealing way.I like the simplicity of the storytelling process.Its a masterpiece no doubt in it.Its a great story.	10
 Great Movie!		9
 sdfsdf	I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.	9
 One of the best film	I rarely watch a movie twice coz the surprise element is missing after watching it initially. The background music, acting, direction everything is 10/10. I wish there were more movies like this. Hats off to every character. So mesmerizing.	10
 The never ending unfolding of Morgan Freeman	This title surpasses once imagination from the time it was written, to filmed and produced; one can not simply say with truly honest mind this was filmed in 1994. The filmagrophy is amazing in the title and the lines written and produced by the screen writers. In addtion too all of this Morgan Freeman does an outstanding job in narrating the story to keep your mind peace clear and follow the line through out the story.If it's you're frist time watching this movie my old tip is that you watch it with the best of quality, without subtitles and enjoy.You will not be dissipointed	9
 The best movie	Awesome movie... the story is highlight and the way Tim Robbins acted is simply superb... one of my favorite movies...! I really loved all the characters of the movie and all the drama involved in it. this is one movie that took over my mind for many days. It created a stir worldwide and made me think that movie's can be made in this way also.so I suggest movie lovers to watch this movie and not to miss a single scene in this film.hats-off to the cast and crew of shaw shank redemption it is one hell of a movie which will be remembered at least for a century.lets hope we get to see more films like these and enjoy the drama and enthusiasm which was provided by this very film.	10
 Redemption And Development Of Hope	"This film entitled ""The Shawshank Redemption"" that was based on the 1982 novella written by Stephen Hawking of the same title stars Tim Robbins,who portrays a wrongly convicted banker Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman,who portrays Ellis ""Red"" Redding, both of whom are serving life sentences in Shawshank Prison. The screenplay written by first-time director Frank Darabont tells the story about their life in prison as well as how both Andy and Red became friends and develop the values of hope and redemption particularly the latter.No question that this was a great movie. It provides the viewer more than just entertainment.It helps them develop the virtues of hope and inspiration. Despite having the setting on prison or being a prison drama, it definitely is touching and it touches the viewer's spirit. Added to that,we also get to see great performances from the cast from Robbins and especially Freeman,who portrays Red and who acted as a narrator of the film.Worthy of mention is the cinematography and the musical score that enhances the events of the movie.While story focuses on Andy,the film definitely mainly on the character of Red as he experiences a shift from accepting his fate of life imprisonment into looking forward to a life filled of hope as he gets pardoned after 40 years of imprisonment."	10
 One of the most powerful movies I've ever watched	The characters are so well developped and well interpreted by the actors that you really feel for them which makes the whole story even more compeling. The structure builts up emotionnaly like only Darabont can do it. Breathtaking!	10
 Be hopeful. Yes, it's entertainment and also something to witness.	After I have seen this movie over a dozen times, in different phases of my life, I can help you by saying this is a milestone to have, not only as a movie fan, as well as a person to see, in this story, that hope is the last and first resource. More than twenty years after I saw this for the first time, I can still remember how I felt then and still share the same emotion now that I am a father and an adult with a consciousness of life. Yes, this is entertainment but also something to witness. Regards to everyone involved in the making of this touching masterpiece.	10
 Story error?	Not a spoiler but a ?Well the whole movie was compelling but noted somethingforgotten how good it was when i first saw it 25 years agobut perhaps a missed fact or?Well when they couldn't find the gun thrown in the river to identify and compareto crime scene,yet they found bullets and broken glass where his car was,wouldn't those bullets at his car be different from the ones at the crime scene....would have proved his storybut other than than,unless he was deliberately framed by someonebut it doesn't even touch on that...	10
 one of the best.	On of my all time favorite movies. Its a great story line with great talent.	10
 Best Of Everything	No wonder it is the best movie, it is awesome.but i see better movies that they are pure 10 out of 10 so i give this 9.5, since there is no 0.00 so i give it 9	9
 The Shawshank Redemption is my first film	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 A masterpiece.	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's best performances, along with one of Stephen King's best book, make this phenomenal drama one of the best movies of all time.	10
 Best Movie Ever	One of the best movies ever. That simple. It's pretty long but it holds your attention and you won't notice. Brilliant.	10

 Very good	"The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I was only 12. At the time I was amazed at how a movie could present so much emotion. As I have grown, my taste in movies has also. Still, I rank ""Shawshank"" as my favorite film, the one that I could watch every day for the rest of my life. If you have not seen this film, I pity you. Do not just rent it at your local Blockbuster. I implore you step away from your computer, go out to the nearest store, and buy this movie. Not only do Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give performances that will make you question your humanity, but you will most definitely learn something that will benefit you as a person. So, if you are yet to see this film, you must (in the words of Andy), ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'."""	10
 THE MOVIE WAS TERRIFFIC	IT WAS AMAZING AND WONDERFUL BUT I WANT WATCH AGAIN	10
 Masterpiece	This movies is a masterpiece.10/10 will watch again.	10
 Gets better with age	I have seen this film so many times over the years and each time I watch it, I find something new. It's a film that takes me through a ride of emotions from tears of sadness to tears of happiness. It's a tale of hardship and friendship. The casting and dynamic of the actors is first class. This will always be my favourite Movie.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.	10
 Masterpiece	I am not going to say anything about this movie. You just have to experience it for your self.	9
 Everything Cinema should be	"Does it get much better than this?After 25 years of watching this, the answer is (so far), ""not really""."	9
 Amazing adaption of Stephen King's story.	This is an amazing Adaption of Stephen King's story. A timeless story/movie that you will watch again and again,	10
 The best movie ever		10
 Finest movie ever made		10
 A masterpiece	"The Shawshank Redemption is a masterwork and an unforgettable movie which can touch the soul. The movie contains deep and priceless concepts such as hope, dream, friendship, hardship and patience.It is a movie about an educated banker named Andy who is accused and prisoned for murdering his wife and her lover and despite his claim of innocence, sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank prison. It is narrated by a prisoner called Red who becomes Andy's best friend.The film is based on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King and starring Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyed Reddis who is a prison contraband smuggler.The Shawshank Redemption is not a depressive movie; conversely there is a lot of humor and life in it and also, warmth and loyalty in the friendship. I believe that the movie is neither a prison drama nor about violence and crime. It has a great foundation and presents profound impressions like hope which is totally adorable and also, freedom and trying really hard to achieve it.The actors presented great performances and Robbins was wonderful in his role. He could perform quite well as an intelligent, inspiring and a positive man. Also, Morgan was completely believable in his role as a criminal who spent most of his life in the prison and is in deep regret of the crime he committed.In fact, I had watched the movie before, but when I watched it again, I was stunned by how much better it is on repeated viewings. I believe what makes this film one of the best one ever made, is the messages it conveys."	10
 I just LOVE it!!!	Its literally my favorite movie. I can watch it over and over again. The acting is of course amazing. Ah I simply can't put in words how I feel about this movie. I LOVE IT! In my opinion its a must watch movie! I totally recommend it.Oh Did I say that I LOVE IT!?Well.... I LOVE IT!!!	10

 Hope is important!	I was watching this movie a day before taking a very important exam of mine, and of boy was I nervous before it. But this movie gave me so much hope, and made me believe in myself, and made me appreciate being a free human being, made me appreciate having good friends!	10

 My Best Movie is Number One in IMDB	"This is best movie for ""Hope"" .This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers.and this is my first review :)"	10
 One of the greatest adaptations of all time	There's a reason why The Shawshank Redemption is top of so many film lists. It is a brilliant adaptation of the book by Stephen King. It captures the eloquence of his words and brings the characters to life. You care about the people in this film, and you're hurt when they are hurting. You want them to succeed, and the pay-off more than justifies the journey. If you haven't seen this film, why not watch it next?	8
 The most beautiful era of the nineties films	The most beautiful era of the nineties filmsThe most beautiful era of the nineties filmsThe most beautiful era of the nineties filmsThe most beautiful era of the nineties films	10
 One of the best movies of all time.	The story is amazingly written, acting is perfect. Everything about the movie is well made. A Must watch to anyone who likes movies one bit.	10
 No limits to human courage	The movie depicts how a man can achieve the most incredible feats once sheer will is applied.	10
 Best movie ever!	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	10
 Beyond Rating And Reviews	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. I won't spend much word on this movie to justify how classic movie is this. Worth a watch many times."	10
 25 years on and still a watchable classic	Firstly, I cant belive that its been 25 years since its release. The script and direction are faultless, the cast are superb and its just a wonderful watch. I'm not going to spoil any of it but suffice to say if you havn't seen it by now, then please do, you will not be disappointed.	10
 very good project!	I really liked the movie I'm delighted with it.I thought about this movie	10
 One of the Best Films Ever Put on the Silver Screen	I like to keep things short and sweet.Incredible, unforgettable, three-demential characters that develop over the course of the filmAmazing story with tons of twists and turns you will never see comingOne of the best endings in filmActing is outstandingGreat foreshadowingPerfect runtimeI would say to stop reading this review and just watch it already but let's face it, you already have.	10

 Classic	Amazing movie - great direction - professional actors - not overrated it deserve to be where it is. This movie comes is my all time favorite movie list.	10
 I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing		7
 A Common Tale which is Extraordinary	It is true that the best things are always the most simplistic things. Shawshank Redemption has always crowned the top movie lists and Yes it deserves that. When I was in college I watched this movie more than 50 times. Watching this movie is not a typical movie going experience where you start listening to a new story, get into its universe and then there is a end which completes the story. This is a ongoing story and you can watch it everytime. In the story Andy a banker is jailed for a murder he didn't commit. But the movie is not at all about this crime. Instead it is about living a life in a Prison. It tells you how people who live in inside four walls still maintain their hopes of living. When you see that a prisoner living life in high spirit you feel love and confidence and the hope is ushered inside you. This is a kind of Sad and story in which the characters are not very powerful heroes but it is about simple people living in Prison. Remarkable acting by Red, Morgan Freeman and wonderful voice overs. Remarkable OST and a never forgettable story. Each and every second you watch is important and not a single second is stuffy. You can watch it from any minute of its run time and it is pleasing. The only movie which I have rated 10 because I believe there are no things which are perfect except this one.	10
 best movie to see	Too good to watch this quite amazing why do i do want to write 234th comment on shawshank redemption? I am not sure,	8
 awesome movie	There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again. I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement.	10
 Best Inspirational Movie	You are going to need daily motivation to help you overcome all of the obstacles you will face in this line of work. This is the very moment when we feel discouraged and want to give up. This is very inspirational and motivational film,	10
 fantastic movie	One of the best movies i ever watched. friendship and the companionship in its maximum levels.	10
 History!	The Shawshank Redemption will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, If not the greatest movie ever.The films draws you in for the very first second and keeps your eyes glued to the screen until the very last second! Excellently written and the acting was a class above the rest!! Highly recommend	10

 Greatest movie of all time!	The greatest movie ever made..! Period. Pure and simple, it is what every director hope to achieve. The film will keep you glued to your seat if you know what it means.It will bring tears to your eyes. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely. The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director.If you haven't already seen it... please do, otherwise you are missing something.	10
 I grow up to The Shawshank Redemption	"This is more of an appreciation to ""The Shawshank Redemption"", as if there were a high score than 10, I would have clicked it. In the history of penitentiary films, this one is on my top list, moreover, I find it a little influenced by the story of Papillon, however, have not read about this inspiration; thus if it exists, I would be proud of my theory."	10
 MASTERPIECE!	Every little thing in this film is perfect. Every scene has a message to everyone. I don't even think that the word 'MASTERPIECE' best describes Shawshank Redemption. This is the best of the bests movies of the world.	10
 Best film I've ever seen.	Mg father kept telling me to watch this and I kept putting it off. One day I decided to watch it with him and I regret not watching it soon enough. Fantastic casting choices. Superb writing, it's a 10/10 from me and my pops.	10
 The Best Movie Of All Time	"I have just watched this movie and I still don't know what I've just seen. The way ""The Shawshank Redemption"" hit me on an emotional level was completely new to me. I was emotionally torn apart by this great piece of art. For some reason I have always avoided watching this movie because I didn't think that I'd like it as much as most people. But I was so wrong! I am in love with this movie! I have never seen such a heartbreaking and beautifully crafted movie such as this one. I fully and strongly recommend ""The Shawshank Redemption"" to everyone who still hasn't seen it. What a masterpiece! 10/10"	10
 Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious movie😍	"So many of my friend's and acquaintances frequently mentioned about this movie to me,they always said that this is the best movie out here but I never gave a try to watch this cause I thought ""Shawshank redemption"" would be a boring art filim inside prison casting old men .Until one day night I gave it a try .The movie was extraordinary , it's a classic movie which has been presented to the audience in a very simple but in a elegant manner ,the cast combining Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins helped this movie to reach at the apex point in the Hollywood industry . This movie has really touched my soul and it affected me in a very good way. I have to say "" you gotta watch this movie before you die , you will never regret watching Shawshank redemption. I know there won't be a single person in the world who won't love Shawshank redemption.10/10"	10

 Mustafa	"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every"	10
 Where The Demons Are More Metaphoric Than Figurative	"Under the authorship of the horror king Stephen King, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" explores demons, but not the ones that that come at you at stab you with their pitchforks, no these demons are the ones that's hidden in you and finding ways to release them from your soul till eternity. Like his other masterpiece ""Stand By Me"", this is not the traditional horror fest that made King a cultural icon. Instead we have an old-school structured prison drama about two life-sentenced convicts who embark on a quest to break free from the isolation of prison to become free or die trying, whichever comes first.Located in the unforgiving atmosphere of the Shawshank prison cells with prisoners coming in by the dozens, the prison walls is just as much of scary place lie the Overlook Hotel only with chains and creaking walls to accompany every unsettling minute that comes about in this place that makes hell look like a tropical paradise. For more added effect, there's a raven that makes his home there and even has a name, Jake who's under the eyes of aging ex-murderer Brooks (James Whitmore) who works as the prison librarian. A lot of the cliches of prison life pays homage to the old-school prison camps with familiar characters like the Bible-preaching tyrant Warden (Bob Gunton) and a no-nonsense, short-tempered prison guard Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown).Starting his career directing B-movies (The Fly II) and forgettable TV movies like ""Buried Alive"", this was Frank Darabont's chance to show that he can direct films of a similar calibre like Spielberg or Scorsese by taking a rather old format approach to this prison story to make something refreshingly provocative and authentic at the same time. While observing the hell that is prison life with power-abusive guards, hypocritical Bible-thumping wardens and prison food that comes with a side of maggots, this story could explain things better than King's novella in changing the way we look at things and thank the creator for giving us the freedom we have as we speak.The main emphasis of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is on the progressive friendship involving two prisoners of a large age gap, the former banker tuned convicted wrongfully accused murderer Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and regretful veteran prisoner Ellis "" Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). The opening scenes take place in 1947 as Dufresne was found guilty of murdering his wife and her lover and while he's trying to prove he is innocent of all convictions, there is evidence his footprints were at the scene and his irresponsible ways come to full effect as his hands were on the weapon. Andy was sentenced to life in jail where he'll like spend his years in Maine's unforgiving threshold of hell itself, The Shawshank prison. With a hobby that includes, reading, chess and rock-carving and his vast knowledge of finance and commerce, Andy is still a loner and therefore 30 year veteran prisoner Red starts to befriend him.Andy is not some incarcerated imbecile his powerful education and know-how has managed to turn his life for the better. When Captain Hadley was lamenting about tax collectors confiscating most of his inheritance money, Mr. Dufresne makes a negotiation of how Hadley can keep his full inheritance under the condition that they all get three free cold beers after working in the sun all day tarring the foundations on the roof.His knowledge in finance and investments soon begin to change the landscapes of prison life for not only his prison inmates, but for those those hard-nosed people who run the prison system. For the guards he's now filing their taxes while for his inmates he's earned enough money to transform a spider-web infested rundown library into a bigger facility for the inmates to take advantage of. And sure this was done in six years, Andy has become a symbol of perseverance.It's strange that we can watch a movie and be sympathetic to a convicted murderer but his message of determination makes us really care for him and hope that he'll be released anytime soon. That feeling of determination is passed down to friend Red who fears he'll suffer the same fate that Brooks did after being 50 years imprisoned only to lead him to suicide because he felt like a nobody in the real world with no friends or family.In return, Red's offering is the power of clemency. Where Andy fully explains what really happened the night when his wife was killed. He confesses that he does take some responsibility for his wife's death and his asking for forgiveness is that turning point to this very well acted and directed movie.Though sadly snubbed by the Oscars, Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne evolves from a convicted killer ex-banker to a warm highly-respectable friend. Morgan Freeman gives a warm performance as a veteran prisoner who finds the power of optimism and his narration comes across as purposeful than self-serving like other films he's narrated.In the end, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will likely fill your heads into thanking those around you that you have more freedom than you think in the outside world that should never be taken for granted. It also gives us the feeling that serving time is not the end of the line and no matter where you are if you serve your time wisely you might get rewarded in the long run and that we as humans hold the keys to our own prisons."	10

 Great movie with no doubt.	I have seen this movie so lately than many of my friends. But this movie still make me so excited after watch it. Great job.	9
 Something With Stephen King Prison Movies Just Works	There is just some thing with Stephen King and prison movies like The Green Mile just works. It is quite disappointing that the best Stephen King movies are the ones like Stand By Me, this, and The Green Mile, including the 2017 IT which did not disappoint. This is on my Top movies list, it's Morgan Freeman, it screams the book, but better. Frank Darabont is a great director, and this a freaking great movie. So great it makes movies like Pet Sematary look like a crappy 80's movie.	10
 Hope Versus Fear.		9
 I LIKE IT	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	7
 A Moving, Cinematic Classic!		9
 Best movie ever	Simply the best movie I've ever seen in my life. The performances are excellent and clean, engaging story. It's one of those movies that leaves you thinking about life for months. Awesome! It deserves the first place.	10
 Andy n Red	"Andy is an innocent man who gets sent to prison for murdering his wife. He endures many hardships such as listening to opera records, and having to do the taxes of prison guards for free. He falls in love with an old black guy named Red, who likes to narrate things. Red is a very wise man who says things like ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" and ""Show me the money"". Andy gets tired of being in prison and steals the warden's shoes and escapes. The warden blows his brains out because Andy stole his shoes. Red misses Andy and leaves prison to go live with him on the beach.This is definitely the greatest movie ever made. Except for ""Overboard"". The one with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Douglas. Not the new one."	7
 love it	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption regard it naively as just another prison movie	"The Shawshank Redemption was never a summer blockbuster or a critically acclaimed behemoth of a film but it is widely regarded now as one of the best American films of all-time. Many people have cited this movie as having changed their lives for the better when they were going through difficult times in their personal or professional lives. Above all else, The Shawshank Redemption is a story about one man's ability to remain hopeful during the most difficult and harsh circumstances. As Red states at the end of the film, ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin.' That's goddamn right."""	10
 Coming of age drama, but spectacular and clearly terrific	This movie is absolutely spectacular and it actually does give me hope because whenever I watch it I know things will always turn out ok if bad or for worse good and hope will always come if you are hopeful and Jake the crow symbolically representing hope and that things always look bad at first but in the end you keep pushing on to survive and make it which to me symbolizes hope for me	10
 That's great fiml	I like it because it is a great fiml about prison. In the fiml i lear how to became a good man.	10

 Life Changing	"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today."	10
 Freedom will come, need to have patience	Days passes, locked behind the doors.Hopes blinking throughout. Fear of consciousness. Shawshank Redemption will be iconic for the entire society.	10

 The Greatest Movie of All Time, and for Good Reason	"The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that should be seen by everyone at least once in their life. I am not one for re-watching movies or rereading books, but this movie is one of the few exceptions. I can recite more than half of the lines and it makes my day anytime that I see it is on (shout out to AMC for literally running marathons of it). It has a fulfilling plot that develops well and a great cast all around. To this day, it amazes me that it was not a box office hit.It's a movie that will make you laugh and cry, a movie that will break your heart one moment and the next you'll be pumping your fist in satisfaction. This is certainly a 10/10 in my books. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying""."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 YES	"The best. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	
 hope never dies	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."	9

 One for the Ages (Mild Spoilers)	"The Shawshank Redemption is directed and written by Frand Darabont. Based off the Stephen King novel, the movie stars Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Red). The main character, Andy, a former banker is sentenced to two life sentences for apparently killing his wife and the man she was cheating on him with. When Andy first arrives at Shawshank, he suffers the typical hardships of prison but making new friendships with the other prisoners makes it more bearable for him. However, when the Warden takes notice of his banker talents, he takes him under his wing in the form of doing all the officers' taxes.What needs to be said about The Shawshank Redemption has already been said. Rather than talking about what the movie has, it is better to talk about the legacy that the movie has left behind. A well-developed story is what separates a good movie from an all-time great movie and Shawshank Redemption is all about the story. The film follows the classical paradigm which is composed of a rising action, a climax and a resolution. In these types of stories, we usually see a ""shaping hand"" in the hand in the story line. The storyteller is there to ""edit out"" the boring gaps and keeps a low profile yet still keeps the action on track, moving towards the resolution of the story's conflict. In this film, the obvious story teller is Morgan Freeman's character (""Red""). Even though Andy is the main character in the story, being able to be in Red's head gives the director suspense to play with. If the story was told in the perspective of Andy, the audience would not have nearly had the same amount of payoff the climax has in the movie. Red basically acts as the thoughts that audience is thinking which is not a bad thing. In fact, this outstanding performance by Freeman launched him into the go-to narrator that we all know and love today. An important component of a good story are dynamic characters and Shawshank has arguably some of the best characters in any film. First, Andy's development over the film is impactful. In the beginning of the film, Andy is portrayed as someone who has been wrongly convicted and is a genuine ""good"" person inside and out. This is seen in the beginning of not fighting back when he is confronted constantly by the sisters to not talking back or picking fights with the guards or the other prison mates. He stayed quiet and reserved to himself. However, he soon realizes that doing good, is not the same as being morally good and that you can do bad things with a good intention. An example of this is when he gets the record from the state government. He knows he will get in a whole lot of trouble if he plays the record over the loudspeaker but he did it anyway because he believed that it was the right thing to fill the ears of the prisoners, yearning for music. He got in trouble and spent time in the dark cell but he knew that he did good. However, the best character development is seen in Red's interactions with the rehabilitation board in the parole room. Through each of the parole scenes following each act, you can see the progression of his character getting more tired as the movie goes on and as he gets older. In his final parole room scene, he explains that he never knew what ""Rehabilitation"" means and Morgan Freeman delivers one of his famous dialogues where he says, ""Rehabilitation is just a made up word so people like you can dress up in a suit and tie and have a job.""Although director Frand Darabont utilizes great cinematography, sound, editing and has created some of the most famous shots in movie history, it is the ""bar setting"" story of The Shawshank Redemption that sets it apart from all other films in any ""Top 10"" list and gives it the highest rating on IMBD."	10
 The Best, ever and forever.	"For me, ""the best ever"".Everything is simply amazing. Its relevant and appropriate even after 24 years of its release. You just love it. Go for it. Shawshank is waiting for you :)."	10
 Best movie ever	This is one of the best moves ever. Great story and great actors.	10
 Must Watch if you have given up hope!	I have always heard what a great movie it was but never got myself to watch it since I didn't want to watch a prison movie. However, I am so glad I watched it! I was sort-of suicidal when I watched it; and it gave me hope and made my heart warm even when I was at my lowest!	9
 An Amazing film!	"I watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..andy's portrayal by tim robbins and red's by morgan freeman was absolutely great..i like and love andy's philosophy that ""hope is a good thing.."" .. and i have tried to inculcate that in me.. i just loved the movie.. i was like.. whats this, its ended so fast.. i didn't it want to end.. i am not a con and neither i wanna be.. but it has shown even the guys out there in the prisons also can be innocent.. and to prove their innocence they can go to any lengths.. i mean that they also have got something in them.. their hearts.. the spirit shown by andy was absolutely great.. it shows that when you want to do something, do it with full heart.. i have just finished it..but i'm sure i m gonna watch this very often, and am not going to forget it for a long length of time.."	10
 Great	GOOD!!! Movie Morgan Freeman is a good actor, and he is still kicking it at 80 and hope for many many years to come	10
 Possibly the best movie that has ever been and ever will be made		10
 Best Movie Ever?	I'm not going to go in detail about the brilliance of the Shawshank Redemption; it would be too much and the most haas already been said.For me,it is a tie between this and 1960's Psycho as the best movie ever.It does what nearly no movie does. It climbs through your skin, into your soul.If you have watched it already, go watch it again and if you have not, go buy yourself a blu ray and watch it. There's nothing more to say about it. If there was ever a 11/10 movie, the Shawshank Redemption would be this movie.	10
 10 out of 10 - SuperB	I shall be short with no spoilers about the movie.This is a superb picture. Everything is right, spot on right. Beautiful acting, good camera work and a soundtrack that really helps the movie to that extra level. It is a slow, but not too slow, unraveling story with some nice twists and turns in it, all with a good ending.Do not expect much comedy and quick action, but a good story.My recommendation: 10 out of 10 points	10
 excellent engaging drama	This is one of those dramas that will keep on tied till the end. It showed the beauty of a griping screenplay. Some films will give a spark from the first glance itself. This is one movie that takes you deeper the more you watch it. a very thin story line with superb acting. But if you just want to watch a good movie with social message and how to not lose hope, then go for it	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont.	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring Samar as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze DI Figaro by Mozart."	10
 Best Movie about LIfe lessons	This movie about time, patience and loyalty of two persons, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends. At first I did not believe that this movie is very good but when I saw it I was without words. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins did a great job by moving the story smoothly. One of the best movies.	9
 the best movie	is the best movie ever made i love it This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time.	10
 Awesome Classic	This movie will be one of my favorite's of all time, it's heartwarming, sad, funny at times and won't let you down. justice is served! Morgan Freeman plays the supporting character for Tim Robbins and just made the movie. He creates so much emotion to this film as the narrator and supporting character to the storyline it just leaves you in total awe of his talent.	9
 One of the best movies I've ever seend.	This is an masterpiece. A very intense and thrilling movie which aged well.After I bought it in the DVD-Palace and watched from my couch, I recommended it to many people living in my street.It was fabulous!	9
 Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things		10
 prerry good movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a film about life in the American Shawshank prison, where corruption among guards and directors plays a major role. Andy Dufresne, a banker, is sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. However, he maintains that he was innocent. In Shawshank, after a difficult start, he becomes his fellow prisoners. One of them is Red, the narrator of the story, who is charmed by the huge cleverness of Andy. If Andy asks Red if he can come to a geologist hammer, Red, who has the size of the laundry, will deliver this hammer to Andy. The contact flourishes	10
 excellent	10 stars for Hope....that's what this movie teaches you about. Keep believe in yourself and hope for the best.Time is the cure of all problem. one of my favorite movies of all time. Morgan Freeman @his best. Would love to see this movie over and over again million times.Best screenplay and performance.That's why this movie is @1st spot on IMDb top250.	10
 fantastic Movie	Remember when I saw it the first time I knew it would be a favorite. absolutely awesome movies that everyone should see. And was probably the first time I got my eyes Morgan Freeman, he's such an amazing actor, so if you like him then you'll love the movie.It's a real Friday movie and fits like a first date film. Remember my ex was completely taken of it. never heard of it. before we put it.	10
 Cinematic masterpiece	Have seen this film a countless times each viewing seemed to always put me at an awe of how masterly crafted every aspect of the movie. From the superb script, excellent pacing of scenes and stupendous directing and cinematography as well as acting from all of those involved. Don't call yourself a critic or a movie buff if haven't seen this...	10
 If you a movie lover, Don't miss a second to see this movie.	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most uplifting, its have been 23 years but it's still one of the best classic movie ever i saw, morally satisfying films of the '90s. Not because it's religious — God never visits Shawshank — but because this is a story of finding hope in an unshakable friendship between two human beings. i almost saw it 20 times. it's give you a perfect taste of this movie. Trust me you can feel it.	10
 Nice movie	It is really a nice movie I have seen. In beginning it seems some boring but after one hour it change the atmosphere. It is well planned and seen are thriller. I never seen such a beautiful movie. The role which actor has played is memorable and very energetic. I recommend to see it all the movie likers. Must watch movie.	9
 awesome script	i remember watching this years ago, i loved the setting of the scenes and to me it was pretty good acting. and if anyone is to go see a good movie, i highly recommend this one, with some people it may not be their cup of tea, but, if you want a good kickback with some popcorn and prop your feet up, and take the phone off the hook, and DO NOT ANSWER THE DOOR, DESPITE THE NEIGHBORS WANTING A OCCASIONAL CUP OF SUGAR, than yes, this is good movie to sit back and enjoy.	10
 the best	"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care."	10
 Very nice!	Excellent movie, I have watched it twice no thrice :) very thrilling :). The characters fulfilled their roles very good. The graphics was astonishing in my eyes. If you want to enjoy these movie watch this in HD format. It was very memorable to watch such kind of movie. The shawshank redemption is included in my top ten favorite to watch. I will give it an excellent score.	10
 The best movie I have seen	This movie is about the prisoners. The main character is caught in the false charge. At first, he claims his innocence, but he cannot prove it. In prison, he has his own world. Also, he is so clever. He plans something and it appears 20 years later. When the ordinary people are caught in the false charge, they may give up their life, but he never gives up. He carves out his life. I think he tells me the importance of living and having the hope. There are not so many flashy exciting scene, but there is some moving scene in an important position. They give more impression to audience. There are a lot of prison film, but I like this movie the best. I think the movie should be like this.	10
 Love	This movie is a classic and will watch for years to come !! I highly recommend it. All the actors are great and the scenes will keep you on your feet !! I have already watched it 20 times and purchased a copy that will forever live in my video library .......If you love drama this is the movie to watch	10
 Hands down the best movie I have ever seen	The first time I watched this movie I was immersed in a prison world where survival is on the daily schedule and hope means everything. I was literally breathless for 2 hours. I just cannot believe how this movie was so undervalued when initially released. This is hands down the best movie I have ever seen. This is one movie where the ending does not really matter. It is the journey that will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will wish it never ends.	10
 about power of friendship	"One of my all time favorites.It is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 the shawshank redemption (1994)		
 the best movie ever	the movie is life changer Out of any film that has ever been made, this is my far the best one. It's just so special and moving. Such a deep and touching message about life and the institutionalization aspects of prison life. It really touches the inner hopefulness in all of us, or at least everyone who has seen this movie. If you've never seen it, watch it,	10

 A Film That Doesn't Fit Into A Genre (And That's What Makes It Great)		10
 Discovered Treasure, Must See!		10
 MasterPiece	Best Ever MadeThe credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently.	10
 Amazing	This is one of my favorite films. I watched it several times and was ready watch constantly. Each frame is beautiful, the story is amazing. The film goes for a long time, this time flies by unnoticed. If somebody not yet seen, then I advise you to look, and it is better not to time. The actors play is amazing! Thanks for this movie	10

 Great	This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Great story. Great character development. It is a story of hope for the ages. I thought it has some elements of reality in all of our lives. Red accepts he is stuck in prison. Tim Robbins character is amazing and is the focal point of the story. He exemplifies many emotions throughout the film.	10
 A beautiful friendship story	If intention is what counts, A Dream of Freedom is a great film, especially when it focuses on showing the strong friendship of the protagonists. One of the most beautiful friends ever portrayed in the movies. A movie that is very exciting, With great interpretations of great actors	10
 Good movie	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	10
 Great Movie	Great movie makes you feel like you're in the prison with them fighting alongside the convicts in their struggle to survive. The characters are varied and very believable, makes you want to root for some and hate others. The plot is engaging and suspenseful and keeps you guessing to the end what the different characters outcomes will be.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	"I believe that it is an excellent film.The film begins with the conviction of Andy Defresne (Tim Robbins) a banker who in 1946; was ordered to serve two life sentences, back to back, at the Shawshank prison in the State of Maine, for the murder of his wife and her lover. The film portrays how Andy Defresne, uses his banking knowledge to gain ""freedom"" from predatory inmates and the officers in charge of the prison. In the passage of time, he becomes hopeful and influential within the prison. This made him gain the respect of his co-inmates, especially longtime convict ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) who became his closest ally. Andy eventually, achieves freedom by escaping."	9
 Movie to be watched	This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories. Stephen King, who penned Stand by Me, also wrote the short story on which The Shawshank Redemption is based. Here we have all the things that made Stand by Me such a satisfying experience: lovable characters, writer flourishes, one- dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending. This one is far darker and far more violent than Stand by Me and so ought to be reserved only for older teens. The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film's duration.	10
 best film ever	It is one of my favorite, the greatest in the world. It shows a man's braveness and right. It reminds us the glory of being a human nature. people are sensitive animal who are always controlled by emotion. Facing the terrible environment, its our nature to fight with it. But when it comes to some extent, we will be despair. But Andy always keep his mind wide open and finally reach his goal.	10
 On of the Best Movies	"This is by far and away one of the best Hollywood films made in a generation. The drama was compelling, the acting was admirable and complimented the story to perfection. The writing was exquisite and placed a balance on leading dialogue and narration. This is a great example of what film making is all about. It doesn't rely heavily on ""movie magic,"" but instead uses camera movement, framing and acting as equal tools in delivering an amazing story to audiences."	
 Great Story	This story really earns its right to be a classic. It shows us a society in which we don't see in out everyday lives, some may never see it, and allows us to empathize with people who more or less made poor choices in their past lives. We see what it's like to be in a corrupted society and how that society works based on how you act and we also see what it's like for people to drop in or drop out of a society with nothing but the clothes they came with.	9

 good reviews of best movie of all time	"The Shawshank Redemption begins with young Andy Dufresne, a young vice-president of a Portland, Maine bank, wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and who is sent to Shawshank Prison to live out the rest of his life. There, he learns how adapt to life in prison and learns lessons about life through fellow prison inmates who become his friends. Nineteen years later, Andy finally leaves the confines of Shawshank, on his very own terms.Andy is intelligent and although rather naÃ¯V in the beginning, he is able to adapt to life within prison by learning from Red who takes a liking to Andy's quiet nature. He is resourceful, as shown when it is revealed at the end of the film that he has planned his escape and life after that flawlessly with only resources made available to him in prison. Andy keeps his hope of freedom alive throughout the years with strength and determination. With integrity, Andy is able to make sure that he does not succumb to anything which may become his downfall.Red, who's real name is Ellis Boyd Reading, is the man who ""I'm the guy whocan get it for you,"" he narrates. The long years in Shawshank has Red 'institutionalised', and he can no longer imagine life on the outside, nor does he expect it. Red is better at perception, as he can see in Andy what others cannot, and befriends the younger man.Warden Samuel Norton is both God-fearing and greedy. He quotes many passages from the Bible throughout the story, but has no qualms in ordering murder to protect his ill-gotten money. He is selfish and destroys any chance for Andy's re-trial by getting rid of Tommy. The fact that he shoots himself after the police come to arrest him shows that Samuel Norton is a weak man who cannot bear the burden of his crimes make-shift desk and provides financial advice services for guards and the warden. Andy is also determined, and the others are aware of his nature.Andy's Blind Self incorporates his quiet nature which tend to be misinterpreted as arrogance by is fellow prison inmates. The judge at his trial for the murder of his wife and her lover in the beginning of the film asserts that Andy seems to be ""a particularly icy and remorseless man"". It would seem like Andy's mannerisms have worked against him in that situation. If he had been aware of the way others perceived him, he may have been able to prevent himself from sending out the wrong message.Andy's strength and determination play important roles in his Hidden Self. When Andy first steps foot into Shawshank, Red makes a bet that Andy would be the first one to cry. ""Lookedlike a stiff breeze could blow him over. That was my first impression of the man,"" Red says. But Andy proves Red wrong. He is stronger than anyone thinks. Red gets Andy the rock hammer which Andy says is for his rock collection hobby, and when the tool arrives, Red dismisses the thought that Andy would use it to escape prison. A series of posters covers the tunnel Andy is working on in the wall, and his daily walks outside is used to dispose of the rubble from his digging. Although his determination later morphs into a trait of Andy's Known Self, his resourcefulness is hidden by the facade of a straight and sometimes dull man.The Emotional Self comes into play when Andy seeks redemption. Despite the fact that Andy is innocent of the crime he is accused of committing, Andy feels that he has caused her death indirectly by not giving her enough love and attention. He says; ""I didn't pull the trigger. But I drove her away. That's why she died. Because of me, the way I am."" He feels guilty for something beyond his control, and neither he nor others know why The Shawshank Redemption takes depth in the basis of human communication; perception. Before the ending of the film, the viewer takes on almost a similar perception towards Andy as Red as the story is from Red's point of view. However, at the end of the film, the viewer learns that what we perceive about somebody or something, may turn out to be something else at the end of the day."	10
 As close as a film has ever come, and possibly ever will come, to perfect.	In a world plagued with mediocre movies designed to sell a franchise and merchandising, rather than simply tell a captivating story, The Shawshank Redemption stands head and shoulders above any other. The manner in which it's apparent beautiful simplicity is built upon by adding layer upon layer of complex sub-stories and plot twists is absolutely unrivalled. The story centres around a central character, banker Andy Dufresne, an innocent man struggling with the injustice of being sentenced to life in prison for murdering his wife and her lover, but expands with sub stories of greed, retribution, friendship and hope in a way that would please any viewer if these plots were simply allowed to unfold alongside each other. What this film does so well though, and what elevates it from just 'good', is the way it intertwines these stories with a roller-coaster of twists and turns that give every character an utterly believable depth and requires even the most cynical viewer to dispense with the notion of 'suspension of disbelief'. Nothing is unrealistic, nothing is over the top, nothing is under explained and so nothing is unbelievable. The film is also littered with Easter egg like ironies that reward those who allow themselves to be utterly immersed within the story, such as the warden's choice of wall coverings and his words when returning an inmates bible. The film also forces viewers to empathise, not only with the protagonist, but also many of the supporting characters in a way few would imagine they could... considering the majority of them are criminals... including, it would seem, many of those who we expect not to be. In summary, on one level, if you just want a film that tells an interesting story with a happy ending, this is one you should enjoy... if you demand more from a film then this is to be considered mandatory viewing. In short, having seen this film, from plot...to acting... to cinematography, you will be left with a benchmark to measure all others by... and a sense of joy, that you will one day be presented with something even better, and a deep sense of disappointment that you know you likely never will be.	10
 Fantastic	Must see film! Great acting + plot. Well worth watching. I highly recommend everyone to see this film at least once! Tons of famous actors in this movie. One of my favorite movies of all time. This movie makes you forget about your life for a while and makes your feel like you are truly there. Experiencing the action front row! While watching the film make sure you are able to hear it clearly. No distractions ;-) Give it your full attention!	10
 A must watch movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie every one must watch, this is one of the best movies on the life in jail and the escape. The movie teaches you about importance of life and mistakes one make which cost the whole life,This movie keeps you busy from start due to its gradually increasing tempo,written beautifully and main cast performed perfectly. Overall this movie is excellent piece of work which will never grow old or out of date.	9
 10/10	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul"	10
 Great Movie	I will watch again & again this movie. Great concept and fairly priced with super comfortable seats and state of the art sound! We enjoyed the movie and the food was tasty enough. The service was spotty at best with the waitress neglecting to bring us menus and forgetting to provide napkins once the food came out. The popcorn was drenched in butter even though we didn't ask for butter and the menus were filthy covered in an assortment of foods from the last guests. I love their characters, acting & story.	10
 A must see!	Powerful, Inspirational and very moving! The writing was wonderful and the casting was exceptional in my opinion! It was very entertaining as a movie watcher/ viewer I would definitely recommend it to others. As a actor it was a great example of stillness while delivering powerful moments! Tim Robbins was exceptional with his delivery! A MUST SEE!	9
 Heartfelt	This movie is one of the most heartfelt I've seen in a long time . Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins friendship was built upon trials & tribulations in a corrupted prison system where justice had no place to exist. This was definitely a divine connection in the most unorthodox way.	
 Men's friendship is the number one subject	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods."	10
 Greatest sleeper of all time	Can I say anything more about this winner. . . Once seen, it totally speaks for itself and I shouldn't really have to say anything because when most people hear about it, they already have a pretty good idea of how incredible it is. This movie is so immaculate. My hat's off to the production company that has created not only the most inspiring film in ages, but one of the most emotionally significant films to date. The movie teaches things to us that we need to know - messages about love, perseverance, and brotherhood - and it does it with marvelous succinctness. By far, one of the greatest films I have ever seen - a masterpiece for today! Easily one of the most awesome movies I've ever seen in my life. The movie has a great message to it, the acting and filming were fantastic as well, wow!	10

 One of the best	"In the beginning, I thought that the movie will be as much movies I have seen before, with a routine plot that talk on someone in some prisons try to escape with the help of a prison guard. but, what I saw is so different, a smart man worked hardly to gain his freedom without letting anyone Know What he was thinking. The movie was so hopeful and exciting, and he let you think who to use your clever in such bad situations, that was 2 hour of my life and I am so happy to having been the ""The Shaw-shank Redemption"" in my watch-list, so thank you and thank you IMDb to give me this chance to share my opinion in this movie."	10
 Great Movie!		9
 One of the most brilliant movies out there!	"Gut-wrenching! Beautiful! Intelligent! A masterpiece! The actors are perfect in their roles, I am surprised Tim Robbins didn't rise higher in his stardom than what he actually did after making this movie. The chemistry between him and Morgan Freeman is perfect! Every single character makes sense and seems ""real"". The dialogues are realistic as well. It portrays the corruption going on within heavily guarded facilities (such as this one) in such a simple, yet brutal way - that despite the crime committed (with a few exceptions of course) it makes you question the justice system and its fairness. I can relate to people I would never have thought I would in real life. I won't say much more about this movie, except tell you to watch it! Even if its not your type of movie, even if you tend to get bored with dramatic tales - anyone can learn something from experiencing watching it! Just be prepared to feel real human emotions. If you don't then something is seriously wrong with you!"	10
 awesome	what an amazing and motivating movie never get bored at any part of it. the music is so amazing and have you in a great movie mode. the screenplay was perfect you can never be bored from it or feel that any part wasn't in its place. Morgan freeman as great as usual never get bored from him knows when to make you laugh and when to get shocked or excited. also Tim Robbins I can't forget him since I first watched his movie Nothing to Lose with Martin Lawrence and the great amount of laughing and sorry you feel with along the movie. this movie for me is one of the iconic movies over history which I have a good memories for it and loves it so much.	10
 Wow	The cast is superb. A real chemistry seems to bond Robbins, Freeman, and their inner circle. Will Sadler, the stone-faced bad guy in Die Hard 2, steals several scenes as the country-loving Heywood, and Vancouver native Gil Bellows shines as Tommy, the cocky high-school drop-out whose fate is pretty much sealed once we're told he has a wife and baby son waiting for him outside the prison walls. Brown, with his hair trimmed so neatly he's this close to being a dead ringer for Al Gore, displays an obsessive brutality that his Highlander role never hinted at. Freeman delivers a subtle but potent performance, letting just the teeniest dabs of despair leak through the cracks of his easy- going facade. Robbins brings the perfect mixture of fresh-faced bewilderment and canny deceit to his role as Dufresne, handling the dramatic and comic elements with equal ease. Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies.	10
 Good movie		10
 Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made.	I saw the Shawshank Redemption with my parents when it first came out in 1994. I remember being sucked into a story that I could not stop watching. I do not want to give any spoilers, so being as vague as possible... as the story unfolds you start to wonder how the story could possibly end for Andy, and then when the crucial scene comes... wow. This movie has quite probably the best ending in movie history. An ending that has been built all the way throughout the entire movie without you even noticing. I have always thought this was the best movie ever made. When I discovered the IMDb website I was very excited to see that many people must agree with me. If you haven't already noticed, it has been given a 9.2 rating which is the #1 highest movie rating of all time.	10
" One of the few movies that deserve the title of ""Best Movie Of All Time""."	What can I say? What is there left to say? I still remember the first time I saw this piece of art. I was hooked from the beginning until the end of the credits, with that wonderful score by Thomas Newman.This movie will make you shiver and leave you with a strange feeling for many days. It's about friendship, it's about hope, it's about life. I believe this is one of the few movies that were flawless from beginning to end, and has one of the best endings of all time. Tim Robbins, along with Morgan Freeman, delivered one of their best performances and teached us a life lesson.It absolutely deserves the Number 1 place on IMDb's TOP 250 Movies.	10

 A Timeless Classic		9
 good	Andy is introduced to the library by Brooks in 1949. Brooks points out a Louis L'Amour section, but L'Amour's first book under his own name wasn't published until 1953 (he had written a series of Hopalong Cassidy novels in the late 1940s under the name Tex Burns), and didn't produce enough books to warrant his own section until the 1960's. He was still somewhat known having written many short stories for pulp magazines, but these featured many writers and stories. Brooks also points out a section of Reader's Digest Condensed Books, which were first published in 1950. and When Red's (Ellis Boyd Redding) parole form is stamped by the parole board, the typeface on the form is called American Typewriter which was not invented until 1974. The typeface is also not monospaced as a manual typewriter would, meaning it was most likely printed by a modern computer.	8
 Masterpiece!	I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Needless to say an all time great. One of the few movies you can watch over and over. The acting in incredible, the story is captivating and engaging, and every actor comes through in a big way. A truly wonderful movie. If you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed when you do.	10

 Get busy living, or get busy dying...	With this film, cinema reached its top. The plot, the characters, the directing, the acting, the message that the movie contains, everything is capable to make a person get stuck on it from the beginning to the end. Frank Darabont introduces himself to the world as a genius with this piece of art in the year of 1994. Morgan Freeman proves himself once again as a great actor in movie industry, as well as Tim Robbins. All the people involved made a terrific job. Stephen King couldn't imagine that his tale could be adapted in such a perfect way. The more you see it, the more you may want to see it again. It's a movie to feel. It's a movie to think about, all the times in your life when you think there's no escape. It's a movie to put a smile on your face, despite all the sadness that may exist. It is perfection, and the greatest movie of all time.	10
 The best movie about prison ever	This movie should be seen by all the movie lovers. It express a lot of feelings. Mad, angry, love, friendship and a lot more. I could give 10 stars because simply it is the best movie ever. No fancy CGI just the pure genius of acting and a very good story line. The cinematography also outstanding. This movie is fit to be watched by all level of age. There are a lot of things that can be learned in the movie. Even it is screened on 1994, the quality of the movie is so amazing making its hard for the director to produce a better one. I hope there will be a lot more film that has the quality or a better one compared to The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 great film	yes, is most of on great film and helps to show very beauty film That is the case for most of Illumination's projects, so I must start by commending their advertising team. Although this movie was funny, the trailer seemed to showcase most of the jokes and gags seen in the movie. The new jokes that the audience hadn't seen before were more aimed toward the kids, but didn't strike the adults as much as their competing studios (Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, etc.) usually do. With a pretty straight forward plot and a substantial amount of potty humor, I felt this film was more for the kids than for the family. The character development was very robust for the amount of characters featured in the film. There were some under developed characters, but most of the main characters were top of the line. The sewer sequences were very well lit and the animations flowed together and were very finely detailed. The movie was good and the voice actors were top notch. I would recommend if you're looking for a fun movie to watch that's not too thought provoking.	10
 Awesome film.	"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs. In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money."	10
 The Best Movie And Ultime Favourite	What A Movie..Excelled In Every Aspect..Right From Start To Finish You Will Love How The Movie Goes On..Makes You Cry, Laugh, Anxiety,Tension..Etc.. Each And Every Expression You Can Feel On Your Face. Each And Every Aspect Of The Of The Movie Is Good. Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman TAKE A BOW. Bob Gun ton IS Also Excellent In His Role. James Whit more Also Gave a Great Performance The Way Frank Directed The Movie Is AMAZING. He Kept This Movie At a Great Steady Pace Along With The Writing And Great Cinematography.Each And Every Cast And Crew Did An Excellent Job..Do Yourself A Favor Go Watch The Movie.	10
 Reputation notwithstanding, this is powerful stuff	"You could describe ""The Shawshank Redemption"" in a number of ways; engrossing drama, riveting character study, top-shelf prison movie. But it's nothing it not a shining example of the power of the indomitable human spirit. You root for Andy Dufresne from the very beginning as a man unfairly targeted by fate, and you want desperately for him to succeed . . . somehow. Mixed in with all of this is a well-written story about friendship, and even a little bit of revenge to sweeten the deal. As a Stephen King story, it's a classic, and a faithful screen adaptation.And that cast is impeccable.9/10"	9
 Genius	One of Stephen King's BEST adaptations (one of the best I've seen anyways). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give all-star performances, it has a really good story line, and the directing, producing, music score...etc. all comes together quite well and really shows off King's talent for storytelling. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think I even have any cons for this this one. No bad acting, no weird camera shots, no mistakes (as far as i know) but maybe I will watch it again and re-edit my review accordingly. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe it really IS flawless? That is just my opinion, so watch it for yourselves and form your own. :D	10
 Shawshank Redemption	This Modern day classic is a suspense thriller I've seen this movie a dozen times and can watch over and over again. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman are a great duo on screen. Set in in the 60s (Robbins) Andy is convicted of a crime and sent to prison where he is completely out of place. At first he is not received well or welcomed by the other prisoners for his clean looks and appearance. He settles into his surroundings and finds his place while befriending a fellow inmate. Meanwhile he is secretly plotting his escape from prison plan. This movie is one of my personal top ten favorites of all time! I do not want to spoil the ending in case you have not seen this great movie yet. A must see!	9
 One of the best movies in my lifetime	Only a few words come to mind....one of the best movies made in my lifetime. Amazing all star cast. Emotionally charged Well acted Well written Well directed Great score Keeps you engaged throughout You fall in love with the characters. Morgan freeman is phenomenal. It makes you realize how important and precious life is. It also teaches how power can be corrupt. The friendships forged in the story are very well crafted by the actors And through plot development. While the main focus revolves around Andy's character played by Tim Tobbins, you are easily affected by the side stories of those that become part of his world. All in all it is an ultimate feel good movie...an ultimate rise of the spirit in the face of tragedy and life dealing you a bad hand of cards. One of my top 5 movies of all time!	10
 impressive	not for a reason. but for the fine art to create a story who seems be more than fiction and who use a script, a cast and location for a puzzle who becomes part of precious memories. its themes, the tension, the moral questions, the meeting between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins and the result of dialogs who are truth axis of movie and wise adaptation, are bones of a splendid film. a film who reminds more than presents. values, roots of justice, beauty of original source, the end who is expression of a deep expectation of the viewer are elements who transforms The Shawshank Redemption in an experience for the viewer. short - a film who must see !	
 Superb		10
 The best ever!	"When I saw that this movie was top of the IMDb top 250 charts, I was quite intrigued and wanted to watch it right away, and it didn't disappoint.The IMDb summary of the movie was quite misleading. I thought it'll just be about the friendship of Andy and Red and I was loving the movie when the real meaning of the movie came forward. It was not just a prison movie. It was a prison break movie. What a lively ending. When you see a film, you somehow anticipate that some twist is going to happen. Like the movies with crazy twists are generally thrillers or dark films and you know the twist is coming, but you are just eager to know what it is. That is not true with this movie. I would never in my right mind even imagined that there could be a twist to this movie. It is such a simple beautiful movie and then BANG!In closing, I just want to quote Andy from the film""Hope is a good thing Red, maybe the best of things. And good things never come to and end""BRILLIANT!"	10
 One of the Greatest Films of All Time.	And I truly mean that. When I first saw this film, I was blown away.With superb acting, superb story, perfect emotion and tone, and an incredible twist ending that still amazes me, this film is completely and utterly perfect. The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight. While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today. And, watching it repeatedly makes the film even better, because experiencing the events that occur within the story makes the ending even greater. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times.	10
 Number 1 for a reason	This movie has been rated number one by IMDb for a reason. Why? What's not to like? It has everything. Crime, drama, romance, some comedy. The writers were very well set on what they wanted. They achieved it. One can watch this movie over and over. Every time I watch, I notice something new that I had not noticed before. This movie is very well written. This movie is very well produced. This movie is very well acted. This movie was very well financed. They did not need to use too much money to produce it however, one would never know. Yes. It's that good. This is definitely a movie that belongs on your shelf or in your movie collection. It's rated number one for a reason. Anyone who rates this below an eight, doesn't really know what a good movie is about. The way it's written, directed, acted, financed, produced and acted. If I had three thumbs, the would all be up. So, three thumbs up. If you've never seen this fantasias film, you're missing out. It's a must have. Enjoy.	10

 Outstanding	This was one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life! This is real entertainment!!!! I enjoyed the entire story from the beginning to the end and I would watch this movie everyday all day because it is very outstanding compared to other movies of this age. There must have been so much work put into this production and I don't know how the actors could have performed so well!!! I have to say, I will recommend this movie to everyone I know and I won't resist the fact to talk about this movie all day! This is one of my most favorite movies of all time, o compare it to the shining and the godfather, but the shaw shank redemption comes a out on top!	10
 Ultimately my favorite movie!	The Shawshank Redemption stands as a truly great film. It is not an action movie, so time is taken to set up the characters. Based on a short story by Stephen King (which is truly extraordinary), the plot follows a man wrongly convicted for murdering his wife. The rest of the movie follows his time spent in Shawshank Prison. Written for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, this movie turned out to be a box office flop; ironically, it went on to become one of the most rented movies of 1995 (similar to It's A Wonderful Life). And since then, it has become the top rated movie on this website. This movie is not action packed, but it is packed full of emotion. Beware of watching it: you may become addicted to it. And that is a good thing.	10
 Number 1 on IMDb...and it is easy to see why	This movie...where to begin. Well it's hard to believe that when I sat down to watch this movie, that I was expecting a grim depressing movie, about how bad prison life could be. The main reason I watched it was because I am a Stephen King fan, and I heard this one was the best. So I sat down to watch it, and I was fully prepared to feel depressed, and also sad. And when I finished watching the movie, how did I feel...there is no way to say it other than: The exact opposite. I felt uplifted, happy, and after watching the ending, I simply said that this was one of the best movies I'd ever seen. What I liked about it so much is mainly the plot, and the characters. Andy Dusfrene, and Ellis 'Red' Redding are prisoners in the Eastern Maine Penitentiary, known as Shawshank. Andy spends over twenty years in the prison, Red even longer. And when I was watching I could feel (even though it is not shown physically) the years passing. The movie spends the first 3 quarters of the movie at the prison, and you really get to know it, and it's inhabitants, very well. The character you get to know best though is Andy. He is a quiet man who keeps to himself, but there is so much more to him then that. In the twenty years he spends there he manages to earn the respect of his fellow prisoners (particularly Red), the prison guards, and the cruel warden Samuel Norton. Then one day he mysteriously disappears. Or to be exact, he escapes, the first man to ever escape from that prison. It takes him twenty years to deceive all the guards, that he is a quiet honest person, that would never try to escape. During this whole time he was planning his escape, right from the start when he asked Red if he could find him (Andy) a rock pick. It took him twenty years to do all this...hat's devotion if I've ever seen it, and that's why I loved his character. Then there's the last 15-20 minutes of the film which take place outside the prison. The last 5 minutes though, when Red (who is also a fairly likable character) decides to reunite with the escaped Andy, it becomes very emotional, and a truly beautiful piece of cinema. So people say this is the best Stephen King adaptation of them all, but I think calling this movie a Stephen King movie, is like calling The Lord of the Rings a blockbuster trilogy, it just doesn't quite cut it.In fact I simply must say that this may just be the best movie ever made. It has an excellent plot, gritty and realistic setting, a sense of hopefulness (despite being a prison movies), extremely likable, and relatable characters and an ending that can truly touch the heart and soul of many viewers. It is absolutely 10/10	10
 Just Great	This movie really displays how horrible life in prison was in the 1900s.The guards, the warden, the facility itself. It just feels so real and almost scary for the watcher. I gave this movie a 9/10 because I found that it captured almost everything I find important in a movie. I also just love everything from Stephen King and this truly is, his masterpiece.You really get pulled into the story as it goes on and understand the thoughts and feelings of the main character.Brilliant actors, a great director and of course the man to thank it all for, Stephen King.	9
 hardly the best movie ever made but a masterpiece nonetheless	Stephen King does create wonderful short stories and while I think his books are hardly manageable on the silver screen I think his short stories are. Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption is the perfect example. With a great cast and an intriguing but not overly complex story this film has everything it needs to be a masterpiece. The actors have great chemistry together and while I don't appreciate the changes that were made, I do understand them. The director caught the feeling of the short story and created a believable experience. Some of the scenes are light hearted to an extent were you expect them to be free the next moment just to tear down this scene and show the degrading brutality of prison.	9
 Amazing		10
 Redemption of the world	It's about the redemption to the prisoner. Or to everybody in the world. Whatever,whenever,wherever,people would make something mistake can't hand on.People always try to control everything but things always out of control. The Shawshank Redemption had many things out of control and he try.We know it ,but we can't stop to trying to do that.And I think I write something wrong words. Not spell English well,but I try. First time use IMDb, first time use English web-page.Thank you	8
 The Shawshank Redemption was a discovery of freedom, for one man whose life took an unexpected turn for the worse.	This movie is one of those you need to watch, if you think you know society. As the plot grows Andy becomes the center of attention for the prisoners and warden. Finally having the chance to be free, it is ripped from him in a shocking discovery, he really didn't kill his wife! The Shawshank Redemption gives an ode to movie viewers and enthusiasts since the film is based on a true story. Liken the film to war veteran on the verge of escaping his enemies stronghold after years of captivity. Finally as Andy tunnels, and climbs his way to freedom, he gets the sweetest satisfaction of knowing he can now start his life again.	10
 One of those kind of movies which come only once in a lifetime.	"The review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and as time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part of the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as ""Red"" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is ""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies."""	10
 A movie about time, patience and loyalty inside the walls of Shawshank Prison	"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus-load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	9

 Its position in IMDb top5 is not wrong !		10
 Only title that can do this to me		9
 The greatest film ever made!!!	In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film ever made. The acting is on par and the directions is pretty darn close to perfection. The Shawshank redemption is one of those films that is designed to make you think, and boy does it do its job. The screenplay is possibly one of the greatest ever scripted. The way it cleverly weaves in and out is extraordinary. Stephen King should be proud that a film like this originated from his book. The Shawshank Redemption is the perfect movie. I don't think anyone could give it lower than a 7. The film will appeal to anyone, if not everyone, and will leave you vey satisfied long after the credits roll.	10

 I was simply drawn in from start to finish. Quite a story.	Putting yourself mentally where no one can get to you mentally. Now that's something to pull off for ourselves in a daily life habit. The pressures in a prison are a great deal more concerning than a day to day grunge and nose to the grind stone. Timothy Robbins does amazing in his role in this Movie and the support of friend made of Morgan Freemans character, solid. It really had me pulled in from beginning to end. getting more review lines in can give me an opportunity to be chatty, sure. But sometimes a movie is just a must see. The less you say. The simplistic thought of conveying there is always something more found the second time around. There's much to catch. If it's on my watchlist I've seen it and will watch it over and over.That's a great way of putting it together in wording for me.	10
 a spotted sacrifice through darkness leads to hope of will in fixing ones humanity in redemption	"Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.heres a ordinary film about a prison where the whole place become the most important character in this movie it cast a long shadow over the film with high walls on every shot with that the characters in this film play their part well a small film that garnered 7oscar nominations has gone on to legendary cult status on DVD and number 1 on IMDb success didn't come it easy like the life sentence handed down to two men who becomes friends so we see this prison as amazing architecture so we see Morgan freeman character red seeing the the see new meat come into his yard set in the 40s Andy dufresne quiet man who is young a successful banker who finds who has being wrongly committed of murder or framed for his wife's death Tim Robbins plays the character well like cream rising to the top waiting for his chance of redemption he is strong character helps in her as fear in there can be smelled a mile away he meets his new family and the guards Clancy Brown ... Captain Hadley / and governerWarden Norton / who likes to run the place efficently but takes no s**t but as red is the the fixer who can get everything dufresne is an unusual like unconventional prisoner he love hope but blots out the outside world his music in his heart in prison you can get touched but nobody can touch your music the strength is that friendship anywhere can stand the test of time even 20 years on the inside with the gurards knowing the need help with their finances he starts his business up in the prison so he keeps the appearance up that everything is not what seems he helps get the prisoners drinks while helping with the roof and overhearing prison guards problems plus keeping them on side when he complains about that he need help in his office he gets his mates starting a business in the jail with the accounts with a old inmate Brooks Hatlen played by a great actor James Whitmore showing what life has done for him .when Andy makes complaints to the prison about a library and letters to the prison board he keeps getting rejected but as dogged as he was with all the time in the world he keeps doing it until funds come in to open a proper library in a prison the first of its kinds but the fixer gets Andy things for him that has questions for Andy but no never shows his poker face plus fouling everyone Andy lets out music into the fellow prisoners much to the the disgust of officers who let Andy away with allot including posters i wont give away the climax of this film as its exhilarating as faith hope selfless and carefree who sees away about life Andy does it deserved Oscar and got none as Andy learned were there a will there away of not fearing of high wall but freeing ones hope of life thats better than being framed but conspiring against ones who persecuted him revenge is sweet As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."" life is a beach or so they say"	10
 An unhurried, engulfing prison drama. Simply marvelous entertainment.	"An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 This is how movies should be made.	The movie is about an imprisoned man who finds solace in the rarest of places and makes him deal with the harsh truths of life in a hostile environment.The movie grips you from the start and by the end of it you wonder of the innumerable things the movie relates to you with. The actors justify their characters with some remarkably awestruck performances with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to be some of the notable ones. Frank Darabont depicts the writing of Stephen King quite exceptionally with some amazing shots apart from a few glitches here and there the whole movie just stands out apart from the rest of the movies.	10
 Overwhelming Scenario and phenomenon	"it remained in the laptop movie folder for one and half year.............. every time i started to watch it i felt bored for the 1st 15 minutes....eventually i started to watch it more than 15 minutes for the first time............... then the miracle happened.....i just finished watching this phenomenon in one sitting with nearly grasping my breadth full with emotions ushering in my veins and artery.......just on sentence requires to describe it """"""It is worthy to be in the 1st place of the top 250 over 20 years and so On,.......if you haven't seen it see it.if you haven't listened to it hear it.if u haven't felt it yet feel it."	10
 Review	"In its Oscar year, Shawshank Redemption (written and directed by Frank Darabont, after the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King) was nominated for seven Academy Awards, and walked away with zero. Best Picture went to Forrest Gump, while Shawshank and Pulp Fiction were ""just happy to be nominated."" Of course hindsight is 20/20, but while history looks back on Gump as a good film, Pulp and Redemption are remembered as some of the all- time best. Pulp, however, was a success from the word ""go,"" making a huge splash at Cannes and making its writer-director an American master after only two films. For Andy Dufresne and Co., success didn't come easy. Fortunately, failure wasn't a life sentence.After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong.Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it."	8
 quite possibly one of the best films	all I can say about this is that it is by a clear mile one of the best films ever made! the story line was gripping and intriguing, there was never a single dull moment and i can honestly say that this film is definitely one that i can watch over and over again without being bored. the cast really brought the characters to life and it was just such an emotional roller-coaster. if you have never seen this film before then i definitely recommend that you watch it! watch it on your own or with friends and family it really doesn't matter because i can guarantee that everyone will love it and if they for some reason don't then they clearly have no taste	10
 Awe-inspiring	One of the greatest movies ever made. Shawshank tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker convicted of his wives (and her lovers) murder. When Andy comes across inmate Red, the two form a near two decade long relationship. With Tim Robbins and Morgen Freeman in lead roles, Shawshank is an absolute masterpiece that every film lover should watch. Frank Darabont's directing is great and even more so than any of his previous work. There's really not much wrong with Shawshank. The adaptation from Stephen Kings epic novel is compelling, exciting, disheartening and inspiring. With great supporting characters, an incredible plot and stunning directing, Shawshank has become one of the greatest movies ever made. Its an absolute travesty that this didn't win the Oscar for Best Picture in 1994 although there was some stiff competition.	10
 The all time greatest		10
 Shawshank Redeems Cinema and How!		10
 Beautiful	I have seen the movie for the first time. It's a wonderful film with excellent plot twists what gives a positive effect to the enjoying of the movie. Things are happening you don't expect and that's good for a movie. It's also a dark prison-film and i like that type of films. The voice of Morgan Freeman is also very nice, and intimidating. The IMDb-rating is very high. I think the movie deserves it, but i understand other people who are thinking that this movie is overrated. I think the reason why is that this movie has less haters then other movies like Pulp Fiction, and so on... .One point can be better: the characters doesn't become older when the movie progresses.But a well-deserved 10/10.	8
 Mind Blowing Movie		10

 Best movie ever		10
 Classic Movie	"One of the classic movie ever made. Lots of enthusiasm is shown in the movie, apart from all the suffering prisoners have to face. Must watch movie. Still capturing the box office. Shawshank is a true story and a must watch for any new member. Tim Robbins has done a fantastic job including Morgan Freeman. The Story line of the movie is really more biased then any other top bench marking movie. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Best script I ever read		10
 A Masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption is most obviously one of the greatest movies in film history. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make an unforgettable duo that captures the audience in magnificent acting and a well-written plot. There was not one moment where the movie did not hold my attention or seem boring. Therefore, it indubitably earns a 10/10 and praise. A tale of two jail inmates/friends, The Shawshank Redemption shines a light on the injustice of this world and the pleasures of freedom after years of confinement. It proves that through all the troubling experiences, one man never loses sight of his dream. This not only gives Tim Robbins's character a chance of redemption but also chance for Morgan Freeman's character to be inspired by an endless struggle that pays in the end. Everyone of all ages should at one point in their lives watch this movie to witness not only great entertainment but also an inspiring story.	10
 One of the best films of all time	I've seen this film many times before , and every time I watch it it just seems to get better! There really is nothing bad I have to say about this film , because the overlying message of the film is infinite , and it's just such a timeless classic . I can't imagine the movie without Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in their respective roles so bravo to them , because ultimately these two characters are the heart of the story. While there are some scenes that truly stand out to me , you just need to do yourself a favour a watch this amazing film. It's one of the best of all time and I can promise you that you will enjoy it !	10
 The Shawshank Redemption deserves Top 1.	"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10

 Is the best movie of all time	Is the best movie of all time. Not only for IMDb users, but also for other rewires. This movie has it all. Suspense, drama, comedy, tenderness, friendship, etc. The photography is also magnificent. The characters are the best actor in Hollywood at that time. An incredible Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The story is complete and has an spectacular ending. THe best ending the Hollywood made. This movie must win an Oscar, but unfortunately, Tom Hank's Forrest Gump, was more patriotic at that time and won the best picture Oscar. It is important to you don't miss this movie although you don't like prisons movie. So if you didn't see it, please rent it now. You wont regret.	10
 The acting was world-class	"im Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."	10
 Shawshank=art	In my opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is an amazing film in the whole way of action and how we learning from this movie. Shawshank encompasses friendship , hardship , hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going though. These artists show their capability to produce art, real art that in spires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you.So, Shawshank is the must see movie in your life before you gone.	9
 Pure acting.	"If someone tells me to describe a real, entertaining movie - that would be it. 'Real' for the lack of SFX is a true bless when talking about ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I become fed up with pictures that achieve success based on the splendid job of the SFX crew or the team responsible for the CGI effects. Film's purity emphasises the importance of the act. The actors are incredible; not a single minute could be considered a bad acting (well, at least I think so). 'Entertaining' for it makes you enjoy the time spend on it and once finished there are no regrets. I am not a huge fan of Tim Robbins but the movie undoubtedly showed his talent. Mr. Freeman stays solid as usual in his act."	10
 Awesome movie	The Shawshark Redemption is very good movie. This is a story that reflect prisons as seen by many prisoner. The Shawshark Redemption also reflect society problems. The plots and actors played very well that make me wanted to continue watch. They are very professional as a director and actor. they capture and identify with America male spirit as it shows in movie. The story is even more interesting seeing red and Andy building a relationship in a prison. Scenes are very good. Overall, this is a fantastic film.Comparing this kind of movie with other type of movie like comedy,I recommended every movie lover to watch this or you will be missing one of the best film.	9
 A Masterpiece	The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece	10
 The best movie ever!	Greetings from Croatia to all...just want to say that this movie is for me,personally,the best movie ever made....keep up the good work...great acting and great theme..and now to complete my review i must write 10 lines of text so i will just speaking about everything :D so what should i write? There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret. Not because I'm in here, because you think I should. I look back on the way I was then: a young, stupid kid who committed that terrible crime. I want to talk to him. I want to try to talk some sense to him, tell him the way things are. But I can't. That kid's long gone, and this old man is all that's left. I got to live with that. Rehabilitated? It's just a bulls*** word. So you go on and stamp your form, sonny, and stop wasting my time. Because to tell you the truth, I don't give a sh**.the best quote ever! :D	10
 great concept great acting great movie	The Shawshank Redemtion ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is my favourite film for many reasons. Adapted from a Stephen King novella, the film is executed brilliantly and expertly directed by Frank Darabont. The film is sad yet uplifting and has many iconic scenes. The writing is almost perfect with all the characters being well-developed. The film keeps us informed as to the lead characters' thoughts and emotions. The score was incredible with Roger Deakins cinematography and it was beautifully portrays 19 years of life in a corrupt and brutal prison. Tim Robbins delivers an incredible performance, as does Morgan Freeman. All of the supporting cast were great from the Warden to Captin Hadley. The film's ending is perfect, moving and justice for Andy delivers the feel good factor. It's a powerful film which should have dominated the Oscars.	10
 An interesting movie...but NOT #1	"An interesting movie with good performances. It's basically about hope and hold it together. It is the final outcome that matters the most.Is about 2 imprisoned men who bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. Robbins, Freeman and the supporting cast is good enough.I don't think it is worthy to be the #1 movie in the IMDb though. That's just not possible.I know that ""debate"" started between TSR and TDK.Anyway a good overall movie. especially if you are into prison dramas, then this movie is for you."	
 Salvation lies within....	.....and Ironically, it most certainly does.Bank Merchant Andy Defrene is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment at the titular prison. Life seems to begin to fade, but fortunately Andy befriends some of the other inmates, in particular a character known only as Red. Over time Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can expect in a prison, his body may be locked away in a cell, but his spirit can never be truly imprisoned.....There is nothing to say about this film that hasn't been said before. Its awe-inspiring, its warm, and most of all, it gives you an enormous sense of well being once the credits roll.From the opening shot of the prison, to the iconic Christ like pose in the rain, the film is chock full of religious allegory, and references the bible in several key scenes. But the film demands repeat viewings, because there is so much subliminal imagery and messages in the film.The acting is brilliant, and the warmth between Andy and Red is the heart of the film, and the chemistry between Freeman and Robbins is second to none.Its a perfectly crafted film, with effortless narrative, and it will make you smile and cry in equal measures.Yes, it should have ended when Freeman got on the bus, but nothing is too perfect is it?	10
 A classic film that everyone should see!		
 Best of Hollywood creation ever.....		9
 Courage, Patience, and Determination	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that shows courage, patience, and determination. We sometimes see some things as impossible, but with persistence and determination, we can achieve something. The story of the movie is really shocking. We may find it boring on the early part but you would just surprise on the turn of events as the movie plays through. You will really would not believe that a certain person could make a hole so long that you can make a way out. I can't still imagine how the main character made it. Well in life nothing is impossible as long as we want it happen. We must only believe of what we can do so we can be productive and successful. This movie is really worth watching. You may find it boring on the early part, don't be bothered, finish it, surely you will enjoy.	9
 Bloody fantastic	The film's been IMDb's #1 for as long as I can remember. That doesn't really raise my expectations, considering I don't agree with so many inclusions or exclusions. I thought this was absolutely fantastic. Yes, it's pretty sentimental in a big way, but unlike that year's Best Picture winner, it tells a captivating, simple yet intriguing story that manages to earn its emotion with some really heartfelt characters and superb writing. It's hard to hold anything against it (if you liked it, of course) when it's so unpretentious and gentle. Freeman is fantastic, unsurprisingly, but Tim Robbins is so bloody brilliant in this. Watching Rectify now, Aiden Young seems to be playing in the same ballpark in terms of the similarity in his portrayal.	
 Performance of a Lifetime from Tim Robbins	This isn't the type of movie that I would normally rave about. It's about the triumph of hope over despair, and friendship over division - it's a feel good movie.But the truth is I think The Shawshank Redemption is absolutely fantastic. When I try to put my finger on why I like this more than other feel good movies, I think it's largely because of the wonderful collision of brilliant characterisation and top-class performing that is Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins.The character of Andy - humble but steely, quiet but intelligent, simple but cunning - is just perfect for this movie. He's so different to almost any other prison break character you can imagine, and extremely engaging. And Tim Robbins is the perfect casting - he puts in the performance of a lifetime.Tim is very well supporting by Morgan Freeman as Red, and in fact the entire supporting cast does their job.The plot is interesting - it consists of a series of successes and falls for Andy. He keeps on picking himself and dusting himself down. You end up assuming that it's all going to end tragically, which I suppose why his final, spectacular triumph is so uplifting. Yes, it's unrealistic, but it certainly won me over!	9
 All time movie	There is nothing more to say about this film: MUST BE WATCHED. As it will guide you into feeling that no other shot will. You will find a perfect line combination between two big faces: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Where large chats will make you think and rethink about everything you though in your life. What's the real point of living? Are my problems serious enough to be worried about? We all should try harder finding the important little things on life that will make us happy, true happy.Moreover, we can find almost-perfect technique on screening every single shot from Frank Darabont. Releasing the true original idea from writer Stephen King.Sit, and enjoy.	10
 #Childhood	"For Foucault, the prison is a creation, that is, in fact, an innovation perfected by reason of punishment since according to him, it was established with the aim of equipping a formation of more affective and usable individuals in society. This same instrument of punishment, which is also an institution of kidnapping, it is contemplated in the movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"". In the film, one realizes that prison, as Foucault argued, is contradictory. This institution of kidnapping, which is a reflection of modern society, has a higher re-educative than punitive effect. What can be observed when one of the characters gets his freedom after spending 50 years in prison, he, however, was not successful during its process of adaptation to the external mode of life and society, eventually undermining the very life."	10
 One of the best film about prison's life	When I watched this film at first time, I focused very much. Screenplay is very fluent and well-designed. The most significant point for this film, in my opinion related to actors or characters as Andy Dufrense and Red. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman played very convincing. I know leading role was offered Tom Hanks. But I am very satisfied Tim Robbins played this good role. On the other hand this film didn't have any awards as Academy and Golden Globe. This fact trouble me. I think the most splendid episode in this film: when guards call the roll in the morning everybody exits their rooms expect Andy and most of people suppose that (as me) he committed suicide but he left. All in all nobody can deny that the biggest success was off the director of film Frank Darabont.	9
" Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 Movement III ""Heiliger Dankgesang"""	"I can't remember how I ended up watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" it's been many years. I can't remember how many times I have watched it. I am not sure what ""new"" I can say about this movie, so let me say something simple. What I say will make sense to musicians and music lovers specifically those who adore Beethoven. This is what is to movies, what is Beethoven's String Quartet No. 15 Movement III ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" is to music. Thanks. I thought of keeping it simple, but it seems there is a rule that I should write 10 lines. So let me say if not for this movie and of course Beethoven's ""Heiliger Dankgesang"" I would have committed suicide."	10
 Great Story Telling	To me this is one of the best told prison movies ever made. After watching the Blue Ray Version - it is more than a prison movie too. While Morgan Freeman's performance and narration are tour DE force, the support cast is outstanding. Even the ancient James Whitmore has a good role in this one.I noted on the credits that Steven King contributed to his writing being converted into a movie. There is no doubt this one benefits from that. Tim Robbins is at the top of his game here too. Frank Darabont directs and writes this movie and the viewer gets the feeling that the director pictured how the story should be told when he wrote it along with when he directed it.This movie is the ultimate trip about injustice and justice within the prison system. It draws deep characters for each role which seem to take advantage of each cast members skills. It also is a the ultimate triumph over despair. Bob Gunton gets kudos from here for his role as the warden.When your looking for a movie to watch, there are few to beat this picture as this one just turned out perfect. If every film were this well done, they would all be best pictures.	10
 Excellent film		9
 A Story Of Hope & Resilence		9
 For me it's the best movie about friendship in bad times and hope!	The first time, i saw this movie, i had a big smile in my face, because of the excellent ending of the movie. It's a high Quality movie in every sense. I do like that story, the writing is great. I think, the movie is even better than the book of Steven King. The directing is great. The cut is perfect, the art direction is great. The Sound and Soundtrack fits perfect into the movie. I don't know even one aspect, why i should not like it. It's the all time number one for me. That means, it is my absolute first place. The perfect movie! It's a great film about humanity under bad conditions. So everyone can see, that even in bad places is humanity. And even if there are bad People who want to break humanity between others with their might and power, they can't really destroy it. And the movie knocks down facades of deceitfulness. I like that! Sorry, if my English is bad. It's not my mother language. :) Greetings. :)	10
 Neat story. Simply genius.	"A friend of mine who unbelievably loves movies, share an information about this movie by the time i won a local short film award in Indonesia. He simply said that this is a must-see movie for a director or DP. So i tried hard to search for this film and finally found it. Before seeing the movie, i read the credit title that impressed me instantly. I thought ""this is not gonna be bad at all"". From the very first scene to the last of it, I can only comment that this film really inspires me to write, produce and direct a neat story telling concept with a surprising ending. No wonder it gets the highest rated film here because the moment i reached the ending, i can only WOW it. Genius!"	9
 Without a doubt one of the best masterpiece of all time !!!	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys.It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 Nice		10
 about freedom	a film about freedom. not only because the story has as scene a prison. but for the force and grace and precise of creation freedom of actors and director, ideas and dialogs, whole script and special emotions of viewer. it is a rare film because it represents more than brilliant acting or smart script. it is a homage for basic values and eulogy to friendship. it is representation of a form of revolution who can be considered fruit of a different religious perception. it seems be perfect. and this is key to be more than a good/interesting film but an extraordinary cinema lesson. Red, Rita Hayworth poster and Andy Dufresne. that is all. at first sigh.	
 I can see why this is rated Number 1 on IMDb.		10
 Very very well	The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent film, and I love love always, but this overrated, apparently there are three visions current world, those who believe that citing Kane is the best movie of film history. 2 say it is a life sentence for the popular media vote, and those who believe other things and mostly know that there is the best movie in the world. Without a doubt, one biennium film, the protagonist is a character you acutes very easily and that story is impossible that you are not put goosebumps. The cast Maimonides as the rest of the movie. Not die without seeing this masterpiece. It's the kind of movies I want to find me when I rush to see one or when payment movie to see, for this reason I put it a 10.	9
 Epic	Shawshank Redemption is a defining moment in cinema.The movie (directed by Frank Darabont) takes a straight-forward, soul- searching novel by horror icon Stephen King and transforms it into a somber, bloated prison drama designed to fill you up with inspiration.Thanks to supreme performances and beautiful cinematography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame. And you get generous helpings of the novella's deft ironic humour about a inmate quietly turning a corrupt system against itself.A small box office release which made its name once released on home video, this movie is well worth a watch if you happened to have missed it first time around.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	In this movie a man is mistakenly accused in murdering his wife and her boyfriend. He ends up finding away to keep himself occupy and finally helps out his new found friend.I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to.I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.	10
 Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking	Well what can I say but, Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.	10
" A ""watch over and over"" film"	"Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it. This movie is very compelling and if you have not seen it I'm not going say much to spoil it for you. This movie takes place over a few decades of wrongful imprisonment of a banker who is accused of killing his wife. The time spent in prison is sought with so many horrors as I saw it especially for a man who never should have been imprisoned. The end is great and after the movie is over they just leaving you hanging on a ""What's next"" Like no other. I have seen many movies leaving you or trying to leave you hanging but every time I see the Shawshank Redemption I wonder what occurred after the beach."	10
 Intelligent films	This movie was really well done 100% through. It is one of those films that is a classic because it is a powerful story, but it's also an intelligent film. We don't see that too much, and I hope to see more films like this! It makes me think of the essence of filmmaking and storytelling, and how much that aspect of our industry is really honored. Every Director wants to tell a great story, but few let the story tell itself. This is an intelligent film because it gets so involved with our character driven plot lines that you forget you're watching a movie at all. As a young filmmaker, this film is a fantastic model to build a foundation around. Let's just hope studio thoughts don't pick up and they try to make a sequel/prequel...	10
 My Favorite Movie .....	This Movie is the most amazing in the industry's history . The best in the way it shows sequence of the events . Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie .... movie has the successful mix ever made of emotions anger , peace , mystery , hate , love , Betrayal and friendship ... this movie will always be milestone in the history of film industry .... View and full interaction figures and the absolute harmony between the team of the film clearly reflected in the article submissions .... The imposition of the spirit of the prison and the transfer of the wonderful scenes that way like a prisoner until the end of the film when liberated liberally of movie's main characters essence of success was felt throughout the film that he is no life outside the walls, but in some scenes .... it's a perfect work by the standards of the industry ....	10
 A Good Movie		10
 Not a film but a journey of the inner workings of the human soul		10
 An outstanding movie!	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best movie of all times according to over a million voters. When I saw this movie I was amazed because of the plot of this movie and that was something that made this movie so special.I also liked this movie very much because of the cast of this movie. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman (Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding) made one of the best performances of their life. Deserves to be noted that Bob Gunton (Warden Norton) made an also good performance.I really recommend this movie to you and I am sure that you will love it because it's a movie that can teach you many things about life and the relationships between people and friends."	10
 Perfection in the making!	A day full of thoughts after you watch this and the remarkable feeling how you make a movie like this. Time is totally worth it. Don't expect it as a random prison story. Plain and simple.No action and effects. The truth to ultimate reality. No goofs as there's an explanation to every scene. I think every actor in the movie gave their best performances. Just awesome. Sad feeling all around but ending is awesome.Character Andy comes out to be cooler than you think he is and shows everyone this isn't it and you might think and which i thought to be so straight forward was his lucky cell location...which can certainly be overlooked because after this is what he deserved as he was innocent!	10
 Great movie	"In 1947 Andy Dufresne, vice president of a bank in Portland is accused of killing his wife and lover of this, a famous golfer, and sentenced to life imprisonment for each although no conclusive evidence of authorship , being sent to Shawshank.He is above the average of others who believe a snob, though Red, one of the most popular men prisoners get to ask everything you like and soon become friends, which does not relieve you of fall into the hands of ""Sisters"", about homosexuals who do not leave you alone. Red lends a hand and you choose to fix a roof outside the prison. There listens Andy financial problems of a guardian and offers to save. That makes his fame transcends and in a few years made the statements of all of his prison guards and other county. It also serves to definitely get rid of your stalkers, of concern to guard. He also placed in charge of the prison library, where you write a letter every week to the Senate for funds to it, with its insistence getting the best prison library in all of New England.But see also the despair inside, having spent his entire life in prison does not want to go outside where everything is hostile to them. The old Brooks, former manager of the library outside is nothing and commits suicide.He has a special treatment to keep the accounts of the corrupt warden, that prisoners performing work with which anyone can compete, and companies who want to work you must pay a hefty commission that Andy becomes white money, inventing a fictitious character where even get legal papers.Andy is also responsible for helping those who wish to study, including Tommy, a boy who wants to change his life. Thanks to him, Tommy manages to get the graduate. And is the guy who tells him that in one of the prisons in which he was matched with a guy who told her he had killed a golfer and his mistress and the fact that her husband accused her.

Norton commits suicide.Some time later, after 40 years in prison is released Network For him, life on the outside is as absurd as to Brooks, and think back to crime to return to their ""home"". It only holds a promise I made to Andy that he would go to a field where there was something for him. He does and finds enough money to go to the place where Andy said that if one day be installed leaving a Mexican village by the Pacific where a hotel ride. Red goes there to be his assistant.Great movie, you see them."	10
 Prison	"A man is sent to prison and has to learn to adapt to prison life,, there he meets a wise old gentleman who he befriends, and there friendship grows immensely. along the way he meets different prison characters, all of which are very likable... adapted from a short short by Steven King,, this is a powerful movie,, showing prison life in the early 20 th century. Tim Robbins was wonderful in this and should have won an award,, Morgan freeman is captivating in his role as ""Red"" , Our main character, Andy Dufrene plans a prison break and needs the help of several of the inmates.. I wont' say what happens after his attempted prison break,, but this is a touching movie, with a lot of character development, and not much on the action,, but it really doesn't need to have a lot of action,, lot's of humor abound, a movie about growing up in person, and the people that you might, and the life struggles of being in prison,, excellent movie.. but not the greatest of all time,,, I can think of at least 10 better ."	8
 Best movie ever	"After watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" I realize that the comment I saw on the movie were not exaggerating, not a movie with light sabers, nor with mafia phrases, much less killing to kill bill, but if you have two men talking to each teaching us to value life. I've always been looking for the perfect movie for me perfect film is one that touches the soul, this movie, no effects, no fiction, I was succeeded, I found the perfect movie. Showing us a point of view that many perhaps have not known yet, one of the few movies that generates feeling.That's why it makes the best movie made ​​so far ""Keep busy living or get busy dying"""	10
 Review		10
 again and again	The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it. An absolutely encouraging story to those who are desperate or sad or complaining about bad luck. If you never give up and try to figure out a way ahead, nothing can stop you to the brightness and freedom. Everything you have experienced will bring you positive influences if you take it positively. I have watched it for many times, at least ten times I guess. Now I hope I can download it and keep it and enjoy it once I have time. I used it to encourage people around me, for example, a girl friend who's suffering from the depression, a workmate who has just lost his favorite pet, and a friend who lost his job recently.	10
 the whole point	This was a reflection of the 'count of Montecristo', especially the jailbreak scene. But still i find it fascinating enough to impress me and have a lot of ingredient included in it. This is probably the most amazing movies from the nineties apart from Forrestgump and back to the future and all. It also reminded me of the series The Oz, Its cool and all, but there's this mainstream way of showing jail and high school as the same in Hollywood a lot. probably so but i'm afraid that not to be true.And one more thing i noticed was that viewers seems to be confused a number of times as the story slips from one another scene and is really complicated. that is it started as a man who have been betrayed by his love to who've been framed then jailed bitched from there and rules there becomes everyone's favorite and the warden becomes his worst enemy and teaches him a lesson while he was on the go.	10
 Good		
 Probably the best movie ever	"There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects (it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental innovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie). But because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great characters.""They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take."" The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a repressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks can't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you.""Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right in.""Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive.""- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There is something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking about? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea.""But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. ""Discipline and the bible."" And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. ""I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.""Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of Brooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And certainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.""I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying."""	10
 Shawshank redemption	This movie is the best of all times.All the actors are in their high limits of their performs.When you are watching the movie you just feel you are in that prison and living all these things like they suffered all the pains.And I need to say something about Morgan Freeman.His voice and his role is perfect in this movie. you are just watching out of breath during the movie.I don't know but maybe I watched this movie more than three and every time ı am finding new things that ı couldn't see before.Also the story is unique and different than other prison movies.I am describing in that way because before and after this film there are a lot of movies about prison life.To give this prison life emotions you need to find some specific things which would grab audiences' attention.	10
 best film	first thing this film was amazing because it all about prison and life within then i don't know why Oscar miss this film and amazing acting of Morgan Freeman it will be the best film that i ever seen i wish all people around world see this film enjoy>>>>first thing this film was amazing because it all about prison and life within then i don't know why Oscar miss this film and amazing acting of Morgan Freeman it will be the best film that i ever seen i wish all people around world see this film enjoy first thing this film was amazing because it all about prison and life within then i don't know why Oscar miss this film and amazing acting of Morgan Freeman it will be the best film that i ever seen i wish all people around world see this film enjoy	10
 Definitely one of Hollywood's most iconic films...	"""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that - but prison is no fairy-tale world."". I think this line by Morgan Freeman pretty much sums up the whole film! Amazing film written by one of the most interesting writers of our time. Steven King, who is often known for giving us fantastical horror stories, brings to the table one of the most realistic terror tales imaginable. Andy, a banker, finds himself accused of a crime, and is sent to prison. There, he is faced with the challenges of survival while maintaining hope, to one day find his freedom. In his journey he makes an unlikely bond with fellow inmates and is able to enlighten them with things they never dreamed possible. This is a definite must see film."	10
 A perfect movie!!	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies I have seen in sometime. The first time I saw it was in my Film & Literature class and I loved it from start to finish. It keeps you thinking and even if you read the novella, there is changes to it. There are many foreshadowing in it that could help you figure out what's happening later in the story and overall. Many film fans should check it out and even later buy it if you want. The film also has many likable characters as well and you'll have some of those funny moments (but not a lot). It's a movie that you'll watch again and again.Stars: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, Mark Rolston. Year: 1994	10
 The Best Movie Ever	Truly a masterpiece. This is one of those movies which you can watch over and over again and still find it as moving as the first time you watched it. This film can not be replicated, because the film is special; the Director wanted to make a piece of art of his film. The movie has no bad points it's what a story should be about, it takes you somewhere that you never been, and makes you feel you lived that experience, and you can learn from that experience. The lines delivered, will always be remembered 'Get busy living, or get busy dying' (this is the dilemma we face in everyday live). For this I give this movie a 10/10 and strongly recommend you to see it.	10
 Best movie ever		10
 Excellent! Beaware of Inst-man-cry.	This is a different one... at least from the kind of movie I'm used to watch in sync with friends. Because the 'action' in the plot is around mystery and complex characters. The movie omits most of the stuff so you do the work, including the emotional work, and that I value greatly in a movie. Movies that make you feel and think, that are not obvious and bogus are the ones you should watch. Directors that don't tell you in each scene exactly the actors are feeling and thinking... no. You need adventures through each history, through realms of thought. Those are the ones you should watch. I don't want to go deep in the movie to avoid spoilers, since I write reviews for guys to decide if they are going to watch. So here is the tip: If you are looking for fun this might not be you guy. You will cry and I don't like that when movie syncing with friends. But if you want to know a history well developed around emotion, and some really funny nice characters, or even some of Morgan freeman then you should do this.	10

 hope....is greatest thing	i watched this movie a 10 times...still not a bit bored..this is the most Beuiful and greatest movie...the screenplay is perfect and the actors are performing just like the prisoners in the jail.The casting of the movie is just perfectly great,i can't think anyone other than the those actors in respective roles.Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman is just great to watch.If you didn't watched this movie you have just lost something...hope...the greatest of things...the movie starts with Tim Robbins sent into the jail for murdering his wife and lover..and imprisoned for two life sentence.he has seen worried in the beginning but he retains hope to survive.When i watched the climax when Andy escapes from the prison i can't believe the moment and i rewind it for another ten times..just incredible movie	10
 The shawshank redemption	The Shaw shank redemption is a movie that you should see this movie is set in the 40s-50s and it's about a man (Tim Robbins) who goes to prison for something he did not do and along the way Tim meets another man during the film (Morgan Freeman). I think Morgan freeman is the perfect actor for this film he was just amazing and I love his voice it's so good. Anyway about the film it's about two hrs and a half long and that's a pretty long film. Through out the film Mr robbins does somethings to change the prison like one scene he makes a huge change to the library at the prison and he teaches one of the prisoners how to read and do math equations. Also he does taxes for the guards in the prison and he loses some good friends along the way and the ending was just fantastic I just loved it and the ending goes something like this: Mr robbins has just escaped and is on the beach cleaning up a boat and then he sees his mate from prison Mr freeman who was let free from prison and they both see each other on the beach and they run at each other and hug. Overall I just loved it even though the movie can be violent and sad at times i would watch this film again lots of times. Anyone that has not here is the trailer : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hB3S9bIaco. My name is Henry and if you want to see more reviews check out my page but for now goodbye.	10
 Get busy living or get busy watching this masterpiece...That's god-dam right!		10
 MASTERPIECE*, THE BEST* Ethical, Life-displaying, Heart-aching,		10
 It is a story of an innocent man's sojourn to the prison and how it affects him and his fellow inmates.		10
 A Breathtaking Story and an Outstanding Cast,		10
 What an experience ..	This movie captures many of things that made us love movies in the first place! It is a movie that contains many beautiful messages about life in general and how we should always be grateful for what we have, it's about friendship, it's about dedication and determination! It teaches that we can find beauty in the most difficult situations and places. I rated this movie 10/10 because I seriously couldn't find any flaw, the direction, script, acting, production values, and acting. What I like about this movie is that's all about humans, it's about the simple human needs that we seek, freedom, love, respect, power, friendship, health, fairness and justice. This movie is great because it can reach to any human being regardless of their background or history or preference, it will touch you so deep!	10
 A Cinematic Masterpiece!!!	The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic masterpiece. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. Andy Defrain escapes from prison by digging a hole in the wall that is hidden under the poster of the model. Warden and Brookes commit suicide and Baron gets sent to jail. Lastly, morgan freemans character is set free.	10
 I finally understand why this is the #1 movie on IMDb		10
 Excellent Movie	it's very good film i watched it more than 10 times i like scene of the actress on the wall and the plan to escape i loved the actor personality Morgan was protector to the movie i liked prison manager in acting all actors were perfect i adore adore adore this movie i will watch all movies of this actor thank you a lot but i need to know it;s areal history or not ? as someone told me it's real but i can't believe that cleverness , beverage scene was good when he solved the problem of the officer , i need to see all movies of prisons as prison break but i don't know names as i'm Egyptian can't now more American movies so i need help in that	10
 They sure don't make em like this anymore		10
 Honestly Incredible		10
 An all time classic	This has got to be one of my favourite films of all time. I first saw it when it made it to British TV and have only just got round to buying it and i've watched it a few times since then.The characters have so much depth, you end up loving them the more you watch this film. The acting is first class. The cinematography is first class. The sound is first class. The casting is first class. The dialogue is fantastic. All these elements and more make this a riveting watch and you end up wishing the film could be longer.This is one of the few times i've seen a film after reading the book thinking the film is an improvement. It seems to me it expands a little on Stephen King's novella.This film deserves the rating it has here on IMDb	10
 Cinema at its best	"Shawshank Redemption narrates a beautiful story of two prisoners bonding over the number of years. Their experiences in the prison and the chemistry between two (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) have been shot with terrific care.Editing and Screenplay of this movie are among the best in any movie you will see. The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently. Overall, this is the sort of movie you will remember for long time and a benchmark among the ""feel good"" movies. MUST WATCH."	9
 excellent	"This is a must watch movie in every once life,love it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that ""entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie"". this movie give a valuable message ""if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPE"""	10
 great movie	it is the most great film in the history of American cinema. Robbins and freeman are fantastic. it implants hope in our soul. friendship relation between the Robbins and freeman in the film is very nice. i know that movie is the first in the IMDb schedule , and its really worth it. When I watch any movie I always return to your appreciation of it and relied upon, but in this film I've seen just so, I said it deserved to be the best and when I returned to the evaluation have really found is also.But I do not know why did not achieve high income while movie display, but perhaps it was due to have been introduced in the early nineties of the last century, and the film does not usually attracts young researcher substance or sexual violence.	10
 Uplifting Film About Hope!	Tim Robbins as Andy a successful banker that was arrested and charged, and sent to the Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover that he did not commit.Morgan Freeman as Red the longtime lifer who serves as narrator and friend to Andy. In order for Andy to help the young man cope with prison as Red is really used to it having lived there for years.Red is also a smuggling expert at contraband and gives people cigarettes, posters of Rita Hayworth to Andy among other things. As people at the prison look up to him. Red has also been denied parole so many times he looks at getting parole as useless along the way.Both must deal with the harsh reality of prison. As both need to lean on one another to survive. And Andy is beaten up by Mark Rolston, as Red and his thugs and after Red is beaten up himself and paralyzed as Andy is no longer bothered again. In the process, Andy is moved from the laundry job.Andy works with the corrupt warden Sam Norton(played evilly by Bob Gunton), and corrupt and sadistic guard Captain Hadley(Clancy Brown), in the prison library and fixes taxes and money laundering for them personally.Andy is placed in solitary confinement a couple of times, once for refusing to not keep on money laundering for the warden. Who in turn, would take away his job and the library he has been working at.As he really wants to be released as he did not commit the murders. And with the help of the little rock hammer that he gets from Red, to build rocks to play checkers with to pass the time in prison. He wants something more to do that than.Won't tell you nothing more as you have to see it for yourself. A movie of hope and encouragement. As it shows you should never, ever give up hope as that keeps you going.Robbins and Freeman make a great duo. And the chemistry between them looks really real. Great writing and great acting by them and the supporting players! Really you will love this movie if you had not seen it.	10
 This is a superb movie.	The story as a whole is incredibly done, everything from the camera work to the choice of words used. I also love how each character is so unique and well developed. So many small adjustments are made throughout the film, to the characters make up for example, which makes this such a well finished film. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a brilliant film. 10/10. (side note, this is my only 10/10 film)It is an emotional and thrilling film which has many plot twists. I feel like this is one of the greatest movies every made, and i have many good reasons to think this.-Sean	8
 Because it's still the Best	Really, after all this time, why write about Shawshank now? Well, simply, it's still the best movie I've ever watched.... 10 times. This is a movie that from start to finish keeps you engaged like no other film. When it concludes you wonder how a 2 hour plus movie can go by so quickly. No bathroom breaks or snack breaks during this movie, whether it's the first time watching it, or your tenth. Just sat down and watched it again 2 nights ago with my daughter (12). She too never moved from the couch and loved the film. This film will hold up to the test of time because it's simple: great writing, great acting, great directing and watchable over and over.	10
 This is a movie that took my heart away from me.	Yes! it's absolutely true.Recently I had gone to a DVD shop. I found this movie and bought it. SHAWSANK REDEMPTION is a never before never again movie. One man is accused by murder case that he did not do that. after he becomes a prisoner. in that prison another man finds him and they becomes close friends. but that man never loses his hope to be a free man. he makes his all prison life to find a solution to live as free man in the world and he does some things to ensure this to come true. then he finds and makes his life absolutely free. This amazing movie was directed by frank darabont with original story by stepen king. afterwards this movie was nominated for seven Oscars including best picture. but won nothing. I don't hesitate to say it's a evergreen movie all time in everyone's life.	10
 Remember Hope is a good thing.		9
 The best movie made to date.	I absolutely love The Shawshank Redemption. When a movie gives me goosebumps, it has done its job. Where to start. The acting in this movie is sublime. I had never seen any movie starring Tim Robbins, but Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors. Tim Robbins portrays an intriguing man. He and Morgan Freeman work together extremely well.The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting, but with these people and their conversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. I was sad when I thought the director killed off Andy Dufresne at the end, but when I realised he had actually escaped I couldn't stop smiling until the movie was over. This movie certainly deserves the #1 spot in the top 250 movies, as it's a must see for everyone.	10
 The best movie ever	"This movie doesn't deserve a 10, it deserves a 11...This is the best movie I ever saw, everything on the movie is great, the story, the acting, the message, just everything. I spoke with so many people that saw this movie, and everyone of them said that The Shawshak Redemption is a truly masterpiece.If someone is reading this- please stop reading and go and watch the movies if you haven't yet, because you will see one of the best movies ever made in human history. It is the best rated movie (9.2) and when I see that rating Im just asking myself ""why is there just a 9.2 instead of a 10??"	10
 My all time favourite film. Beautiful.	What can i say, its shaw shank. I don't refer the film as the shaw shank redemption i call it shaw shank as everyone knows what I'm on about when i say its my favourite (and i only seen it in April 2012). The story is well known as Andy dufrense is wrongly accused of a double murder and sentenced to shaw shank prison where he meets red (played by the awesome Morgan freeman). Over time in the movie he adapts to life in prison and escapes and becomes a free man. How did a movie this so simple become beloved by so many. How? I don't know how and i don't care but this film is basically a beginner for any filmmaker and already became a success years later. Although it did not great at the box office yet critics praised it well, years later people discovered it on VHS. I wished i seen this film earlier as a teenager as it would have struck to me even more through a time i felt depressed and sad. A discovered this movie in the local library and rented it as i heard of the film being very good and after seeing it, it is more than just good. I may be over-exaggerating this brilliance of the film but it unlike many other films (except the lion king of the return of the king hit me right in the soft spot). I didn't cry at the end, i smiled at the end. What a film.The good of the film, the acting from freeman. Although he lost to hanks in Forrest gump for best actor, i don;t care as hanks did as much as a good job as freeman did (if better). Tim Robbins was also amazing and likable with the supporting cast doing perfection to the highest level. The score is beautiful, the mies en scene, the scripting writing is gold and genius making this a classic. This film is not complex and it is something that makes it just so darn good. The pacing is perfect and the narration from freeman is timeless. The iconic shots of Andy raising is hands in the air after escape is timeless as and should be attempted when finishing school (as i have did).A film highly recommend by me and others as well, touched me to the point of joy and laughter and will bloom your day as it always will live as cinemas most beloved classic ever. 5/5	10
 One of the greatest films ever made.	"Whenever I see a prison or even think about it, the first thing that comes to my mind is this film. Maybe it's because I have watched this masterpiece so many times that it's actually made a place inside my head and will never go away. I just cannot explain how well this film is made. The direction and screenplay by Frank Darabont and the fact that it is based upon ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King makes it highly likable. Moving on to the performances by Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, they shine just like a diamond, stupendous performances by them. I still can't believe that it never got any major accolade and didn't even make much money but still it has developed into something sensational which can't be missed."	10
 Great among greats.	I have three framed posters of my favourite films on my wall. On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.	10
 Love this movie!	I'll keep this short and sweet. I am not the type of person who reads critique reviews and determines whether that will make me watch a movie or not. However, I didn't think I would ever want to see this movie after seeing the preview and a friend said it was a bit slow. I have to honestly say that I was impressed by the directing, acting and overall story. This is a great move! You should defiantly take the time out of your life to see a great movie that is not a superhero remake. This story has structure, purpose and meaning. Though, if you can't sit still then don't bother. However, I do think it's time we get some culture back in our lives.	10
" ""Best of all time"""	"I can't figure out how a man could think such an outrageous concept like that!Its just beneath all the beautiful thing.Thanks to Frank Drabount,Morgan Freeman,Time Robbins.Excellency is sky high in this film.Not a movie,its just a lifetime experience.Sometimes people felt to sad ,they curse themselves,regret for everything they have done in life.They crush for success,run after money.But,here is the thing that changes everything and it is indeed ""The Hope"".No matter how bad you feel,no matter how hard the path of the life is,the show is still goes on if you have just one thing and that is ""The Hope"".Life would certainly changes if peoples take the deep meaning of this wonderfully executed movie.Probably It will help many people to start their life for the second time!!Hats off to everyone who worked with the Shawshank Redemption Team.."	10
 This is the film	What can I add to all the other reviews here? Just my own feelings about this. I now realise I watched the film in one of the hardest times, emotionally, I can remember in my life. Thoughts chasing themselves around in my head, heartbroken, paranoid and not well physically. Total mess.My dear female friend who got me through it all told me this was a film to watch. I initially resisted, thinking it was going to be lightweight, PC fare. I don't know why I thought that.There's a lacklustre opening sequence -I think. Then you get to see what kind of performance Morgan Freeman is going to turn out this time, and you start to be interested. Then this extraordinary scene flying over the prison, and I think by then you're hooked.This scene is deeply moving, not least because of the music. It's difficult to see how Thomas Newman's music for this film could possibly be bettered - perfectly listenable to in it's own right, but when you do you're reminded of the boys on the roof in the sun, enjoying their first beer for so long. They've been touched by Andy's kindness. Sometimes a kindness is thrown back in one's face, but other times a gesture of gratitude is given back - like Haywood getting up and offering Andy one of his beers - and a powerful connection is made. The film is full of great hardships and unbearable sadness - surely scars that can never completely heal or be forgotten. But it is also full of joy and fun and hope. To capture all the above in a film is a triumph. I started watching the film fairly closed to feeling, but as I watched the end I could not contain my tears, unusually.So a moment when a film came along at the right time for me, and no doubt for many others	10
 Get up and watch it	"""I have been thinking for a while to watch "" Shawshank Redemption""(1993) the number one movie on IMDb list 9.2/10,finally did it, its a excellent example of good story telling ,one of the story that makes u think and touches your soul, this movie is all about hope ,hope in bad times & not letting it go whatever is the situation ,hope that one day u will have your laugh,hope to be loved again,hope to achieve something big,hope to breath free. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins)not only was hopeful for himself in the his bad time but made his prison mates hopeful by providing them feel of freedom through books and music,he also gave his best prison mate Red (Morgan Freeman) reason to live once he made it out from the prison. and as Tim Robbins says ""hope is one of the good things and good things never dies""."	9
 No good thing ever dies.		10
 Brilliant. Shakes you to the core.	"Best movie I ever saw. It's a pinnacle in humankind's endeavor in film making and unbelievably without any special effects or fanfare. It's a story about normal human beings. Direction, screenplay and acting all are mind-boggling. Equally mind-boggling is how can this movie not get an Oscar even after considering that jury at Academy awards makes huge mistakes sometimes(remember ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon""). In my mind I've no doubt that even if ""Avatar"", ""Titanic"", ""Return of the King"" and ""Ben Hur"" were all released in same year as this movie, the Oscars for best film, best direction, best actor and best supporting actor should all go to this movie. I've become a huge fan of Tim Robbins (he is brilliant in ""The Mystic River"" too) and Morgan Freeman. Also, let's not classify it as a prison movie since it's in a class of its own. It exhausts all superlatives. If you haven't watched it, watch it now. Who knows the world may end tomorrow :-)."	10
 A Truly Amazing Experience	This title has to be one of the greatest films ever made. It is a touching story of a man who is sent to prison for life for the accused murdering of his wife and her lover. The story is so captivating and completely differs from other prison films because of its heart.A defiant masterpiece which makes you enthralled within it from the very beginning. Brilliantly acted by Tim Robbins and, of course, Morgan Freeman as always. Brilliantly directed, scripted and the original score was very, very good.I have watched it three times in the last year and I still can't get enough of it. A defiant worth wile watch.	9
 Absolutely Amazing!!!!	"Decided to check out IMDb topper as a time pass and was i glad i did.One watch and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has been added to my all time top movies...The golden year of '94 which gave the world some of the best films of all time didn't disappoint with this one...The cast was superb...Tim Robbins is amazing and Morgan freeman again shows why he is at the top.The bond between the main characters is well developed and the climax is mind blowing.The movie gives genuine inspiration and is more than suitable for repeated viewing when one feels down.I give it full 10/10 as it gives u more than a regular film does.It shows the importance of hope in life and why one should never loose it.The Tagline tells it all - ""FEAR CAN HOLD YOU PRISONER,HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE""..."	10
 Awesome	"Awesome movie, Based on the Stephen King novel, Shawshank Redemption is a delight from first scene to last. The opening is a brilliantly done sequence with Andy's (Tim Robbins) trial inter cut with his actions on the night of his crime.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of double murder who is sent to jail, eventually befriending other lifers including Morgan Freeman's Ellis Redding. Exceptionally handsome adaptation of Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" (in the film version, it's really Raquel Welch, not Rita, who aids in the ultimate twist). On the surface, it's another prison-genre picture with the usual stereotypes such as a rotten warden, a cruel guard, a few homosexuals, and a quirky old-timer who doesn't want his parole. However, the film's emotions run surprisingly deep, justice is well served by the conclusion, and several of the cast members carve out amazing, three- dimensional characterizations."	8
 A film you won't forget.	I'll always remember watching this film when i was younger, it was one of the first films that ever gave me that 'mind-blowing' experience you sometimes get when you've seen a brilliant movie. Tim Robbins gives what is undoubtedly for me his best performance as Andy, who is such an inspiring character that you find yourself truly rooting for even in the early stages of the film. Morgan Freeman gave a stellar performance, arguably his best also, as Red, Andy's cell mate another character you grow to love during this wonderful piece of cinema. This is a film i will never tire of, if you haven't watched it for whatever reason, you should do! A solid 10/10 for me! enjoy.	10
 A Shining Piece Of Cinematic Excellence		10
 You'll laugh, you'll cry	What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day. But I think in the future it will prove to be an important mark in cinematic history.	10
 Excellent cast and story Line	"I saw this movie for the first time 8 years ago. I just happened to see it by chance on cable because I never heard about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" before. After watching the movie I was immensely impressed and positively surprised. Definitely this is the best movie I've ever seen. The story, the direction and the cast (Specially Tim, Morgan and Gil Bellows) are perfect! The Shawshank Redemption really deserves that spot in the rankings. This movie is a ""must see""! The movie not only offers a great viewing experience but also a lesson to take home. Wish more movies are made in this fashion instead of the blood and gore that people seem to appreciate nowadays.Thanks for reading this review."	10
 Shawshank Redemption Review	Shawshank redemption is probably one of the greatest movies out there hands down. Its a story about a banker named Andy Dufresne who is sentenced to life in prison for killing his wife and her secret lover.At first for Andy it seems that life has taken a toll for the worst while he goes through the first initial weeks in Shawshank.Fortunately he befriends a group of the inmates over the course of his time there. Mainly a character named Red who has some push on things that go down in the prison. Red and Andy learn a lot of lessons from each other and become really great friends over their course of time at Shawshank. The dialogue in this movie is not only enticing, but also has a bit of comic relief here and there. To me this movie mainly revolves not only the character development of Andy as a man sent to jail for life, but mainly about the human condition and what it is like to no longer be a free man. Andy's' most important lesson that he learns in Shawshank is that while they can take virtually everything away from you including your pride and your dignity, they can never take your Hope.	10
 A Fountain of Hope	If you want to see hope in its most poetic and dramatic sense, choose The Shawshank Redemption. I commend it to everyone who thinks movies are more than source of 'entertainment',that they are mirrors of life and its moral lessons. I cannot find any other movie with such compelling touch of hope, faith and love. You will understand what redemption is, you will understand what a Fountain of Hope can do, if we let it reign inside of us.From the production, to the timing, to the script, and the acting of each character, The Shawshank Redemption gave justice to its box-office title. It may have not won Best Picture but for me, it is the Best Picture by far.	10
 Plainly Superb!		10
 A Truly Timeless Classic	94 was such a great year for movies, we had cult classic's like Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction & Speed, But I always thought out of all those.. Shawshank was a movie which didn't get the recognition it deserved from critics and viewers alike. Call me a snob I don't think you cannot call yourself a movie buff, unless you've seen this movie.The plot revolves around an innocent banker sent to prison charged of murder of his wife and befriends an old friendly character portrayed perfectly by Morgan Freeman. Andy Dufriene is a eccentric prisoner and when you live his life (visually of cource) it defines what solace really is. Happiness and sorrow.This movie is definitely worth a buy without question, so do yourself a favour and purchase it ASAP!	
 Brilliant!!!	Plot: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a banker, convicted of a murder he did not commit and sent to Shawshank prison. After two months of being there, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) 'a man who knows how to get things'. The warden (Bob Gunton) uses Andy's banking skills for his scams and turns out to be more ruthless than he thought. Andy spends twenty years in prison before his legendary escape.This is said to be the best film ever made. I can see why. It is defiantly my favourite film of all time. Some say it is too over rated and that might be true but there's no doubt it is a fantastic and well executed film. The acting is good. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator. William Sadler is also good. You can't help but laugh with Haywood.The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant story of, hope, friendship and obviously redemption. It also has a way of connecting with the viewer's experiences. People relate their own life to the film and it helps people deal with bad moments it their lives. This is not a film to miss.	10
 timeless and classic	I avoided seeing this film for years because I thought it was a grim prison uprising tale from Stephen King. Well, I was one third right, it is set in a prison but it is a very good story about friendship, honesty, forgiveness/redemption, patience and loyalty. I'm going to really try and not give away too much of the film because if you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out on a great story. It's set in a prison in the late 40's. Some of the inmates have been there since the early part of the 20th century and with repeated parole denials and no rehabilitation in sight, many have been institutionalized and have lost hope and even lost sight of their own identity. When one such inmate is released, he walks into a world that he barely recognizes. He tries but in the end, fails to make it in the real world and succumbs to desperation and hopelessness. We see some of the guards greedily taking part in violence that is so vicious that it is difficult to discern the prisoners from the prison staff. But, ultimately it is a tale of redemption and the story unfolds with hardship, humor and grace. This is a film that I will see again and again.	10
 film	"what a narration..???,One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair."	10
 fantastical!	this film is simply brilliant. the characters are all totally awesome and so are the actors who play them! also when watching this amazing film, you don't think to pick up on the little things until it all becomes clear! it truly is one of the best films that i have ever seen along side requiem for a dream and the lord of the rings trilogy. it is that good that when watching it, you forget that it is a film because you get so into the story and so in love with all of the characters. the men/women who wrote the script for this outstanding movie sensation is exceeding talented, as are all of the people involved in this production and they should all be proud of themselves for producing one of the top three greatest films of all time.	
 Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies...a fine piece of art....		9

 Scheme Of Hope		9
 A work of Art and a message of Hope.	"Stephen King is my favourite author and I like most of his books and love some as well. One of the defining features of his books is the characterisation and the atmosphere. No one does it better. This leads to his books being long and slow some times but that's the part of it. This normally doesn't transfer well to cinema where everything is cut and compressed. This movie is better than the book. I read the book and I was impressed I saw the movie and I fell in love with it.The movie focuses on the two main characters and the side stories enhances their character brilliantly. All what comes before ties in to the end. One of the greatest effect in the movie along with the atmosphere is the soundtrack. It plucks at you, it pulls at you and it lulls you in to a world where all that you see flows with it, smiles with it and cries with it.I wont talk about the story since now after so many reviews we are at a stage where we can talk about other features of this movie. There are many great moments in the movie including the two stage ending, both stages immensely enjoyable every time for different reasons. Another great moment for me is the release of Brooks Hatlen from prison. His dialogue delivery (the world went ahead and got itself in to one BIG DAMN hurry) and acting is brilliant at that moment and is perfectly captured further ahead in the movie when Red facing similar circumstances confesses, ""Terrible thing to live in fear"" The same fear can be glimpsed when Red glances fearfully over a stone wall in Buxton to see if he is being pursued or spied upon while he reads a letter. (Great acting and direction) This movie is about hope and friendship. Those of us who have seen it many times, enough to even forget the count are touched by it every time. We now see the movie in its entirety and every magical scene is impressed upon our memory because this is art. The message of eternal hope is wonderfully characterised in Andy and that of friendship in Red."	10
 A great adaptation of a great book.		10

 A Cracking Film That Every One Should Own	The first time I watched this film I was on a coach heading to the french Alps in year 8 of school. I loved it from the first moment. A few weeks later when I discovered the title of the film I went out and brought it, (or more correctly had it brought as I wasn't old enough). It remains one of my favourite films in my collection.Why do I think this is one of the best films ever, it comes down to the telling of a great story, in a great way, by great actors. From the moment the film begins your sucked in, the audience is made to connect with the events we see on screen thanks to the soulful voice of the great Morgan Freeman, he has the ability to help us relate with events and almost forget we are watching a film, but instead listening to a story from a much loved grandparent. When he speaks the audience definitely listens.However Morgan is by no means the star. The less well known but equally talented Tim Robbins, his performance of Andy Dufresne, is in my opinion one of the all time greats. The way in which the character attempts to retain dignity and his humanity, instead of being twisted into the archetypal convict is reason enough for this film to be in the IMDb top 250. The way at which Dufresne strives to improve his and the other convicts leaves you with a taste on the honourably of the character, or his rebellious acts toward the Warden just to provide the inmates with a piece of music is a scene which you remember just because of its shear brilliance. Which reminds me big thanks to Steven King for writing the book this film was based on, you did good, like you normally do.No one could review this film without mentioning James Whiymore who plays the tragic figure of Brookes, the old lovable inmate. The sad tale of the man who had spent his life in prison and dies in freedom is the emotional heart of the film, I feel sad every time I watch it. James Whitmore was truly a great actor, this film proves it. Th story never gets tedious no matter how many time you watch it, and if its your first time watching be set for a treat.The best thing I can say about this film is watch it, and the only problem you'll have is trying to get across to your friends exactly why the need to see this great piece of cinema	9
 Just to add another...		10
 A movie beyond words,loved it !!	This is my 1st review on IMDb , i don't like writing reviews for a movie after all it's just a movie.....you see a movie and you forget... 95% of the movies you see and you forget soon, well this movie really moves you and some of it remains with you ....gives you a great deal of idea how the real world is... each time you see it you feel light and get a feeling of satisfaction .... and more over if you like Morgan free-man you'll love of him after this one.... GREAT MOVIE... used to wonder why is it so highly rated.... well after seeing it.... i don't want to let the rating fall so i added mine and given it what it deserves...and i hope it remains at the top... i would like to thank the film maker and the production as a fan for a wonderful experience i got after seeing this movie :)	10

 My favorite movie.		10
 Inspiration can come where you least expect it		8
 you want a great emotional story, here you got it	this movie is all about that great story King wrote, that with great cinematic expression, great acting, great sub plots, this is a movie you can see many and many times in your life and every single time you see it, it will deliver emotional good feelings...Andy Dufresne's expression on his face through out the whole movie is incredible, the very old guy with the bird, he's just perfect, i feel like he's my grandpa or something, you just can't help to not love him, his character is the one that really got me emotional... Morgan Freeman is great like in all his films, you just can't think of a better casting... i love this filmi'm not quite sure if it deserves to be #1 on the top 250 IMDb list, but well, you decide... hope you love it as much as i do !	8
 A Truly Epic Redemotion! Every Prisoner must see		10
 Simply the best movie ever made!!	I have seen this movie about 6 times and I get stunned every time. Now has past one year since I last saw her, so it got me thinking; what is so good about this film? is'it the story? the director? the actors? or maybe just all of this things?. I mean what makes this the best movie ever made?? Is'it the feel-good feeling in the end? I don't know a person whose does't feel good after this movie. Tim's and Morgans's performances both deserved Oscar, but I'm not gonna take'it from Tom Hank's that his performance in Forres Gump also deserved Oscar. So if anyone can tell me the ONE thing that make's this the best movie ever made.	10
 Camaraderie between Robbins & Freeman is too difficult to surpass.		10
 Great Film.	"When thinking of how to vote/rate a film such as The Shawshank Redemption, I can only think, ""What didn't I like?"" Honestly, there's nothing in this movie I can think of to make it better. Great story, great characters, great actors and great scenes. Stephen King is an amazing story teller. Luckily, Frank Darabont has the ability to translate it into film.When it's on TBS or USA, I always find myself finishing the movie whether it's just started or has 15 minutes left. I'd like to think of myself as a person with enough films under my belt to recognize an amazing piece when they cross my path. This on the other hand crossed my path, sat down, and entertained me."	10
 People may read what they like into movies.How a cult is born....	"First off... I really liked ""The Shawshank Redemption"".It's a movie that is comfortable with itself,it knows exactly what it is - a good prison story with excellent performance from the leads and a happy ending.It was never intended to be a cult masterpiece,that status has become an ""aftermarket accessory"",so to speak. With only a ""so - so"" initial reaction nobody concerned could have imagined it would be elevated to the pantheon of movie greats. I suspect that in a world desperate for good to be recognised and evil punished,a world where the small man was becoming increasing powerless against ""Them"",heroes like Andy and Red,abundantly decent and ""ordinary"" raged against the machine on the audience's behalf. Movies about good vs evil whether ""Star Wars"", ""Lord of the Rings"" or the later ""Harry Potter"" series have built huge followings largely on that basis. Mr King's original novella could not have produced such an affect,it needed a movie with all its immediacy and impact to open out his story and punch his message to the audience. Whilst a book may be put aside and continued later,thus weakening its affect,a movie is seen in its entirety in a relatively short space of time - no distractions. There has always one small thing that has bothered me for years.... How did Andy hang his poster of Rita Hayworth back up covering the hole in his cell wall after he had escaped? That apart,""The Shawshank Redemption""is a completely satisfying prison story,bringing up to date the old George Raft,James Cagney movies from the 30s and 40s. Many people,for whom it has a special message,think it amongst the finest films ever made."	8
 Not so much a movie as a work of art.	"Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, ""Shawshank"" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time."	10
" There's a reason why this didn't win ""Best Picture"""		10
 One of the two greatest movies I have ever seen		10
 A classic	Seeing Shawshank as the IMDb #1 did not surprise me a bit. This movie has the heart & soul to be a favourite for a long time to come.I like the reality of the unfairness of the whole situation. There is no glossing over the painful stuff. He was innocent but still jailed. He did get raped. His chance DID get wiped out to have his story confirmed. What a waste.I read some people calling this a 'feel-good' story. Perhaps in the end, but other than the relief of freedom, there wasn't much to feel good about. Talk about a hard-fought battle. And it isn't even over... His life is better than it was, but still sucks considering everything he lost, considering he can never go back, considering he is always a fugitive...If you're feeling bummed out about your own life, this is a good movie to watch to realize that things could always be worse.	10
 More Popular as Times Passes	"In these times, where an ""Every man for himself"" mentality prevails and one's self worth is measured by possessions, this movie reminds us that the escalating fear that we all have, as this country spirals out of control, is best abated by having someone you can call a true friend.As time passes and, more of us see that this country is heading inexorably toward social, political and economic disaster, this movie will find an even larger audience of devotees. Perhaps, one day, we will abandon our materialism and discover that true hope which we will desperately need and, a major theme of this movie, lies in our relationships with others. Until then, we will have the Shawshank Redemption to remind us what real friendship looks like."	10
 The benchmark of finest film-making	"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will really never ever be forgotten. Arguably the best movie of all time. A thundering reassurance in the hope for a better tomorrow, this movie is truly an epitome of hope and perseverance. Probably should be filed under the category of movies you should watch anyhow before you die. True masterpiece. There won't be another movie that can be quite anything like this.This movie is so powerful that I can't even describe this in a few words. This is the kind of movie that rekindles hopes in all of us. The kind of movie that will always keep moving and impressing generations to come. With a storyline that not only will blow you away, but also strengthen your hopes and faith in the fact that ""Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies""."	10
 The greatest movie ever made...		10
 American story telling at its best	I'm a big fan of movies that have depth and tells a great story. American movies doesn't always provide that.The Shawshank Redemption, however, is a prime example of what American story telling can be. With a slight non-linear build up, strong and patient character development, the movie drags you more and more into the despair of Andy Dufresne, but always with a sense of hope.For me, there's no two ways about it. This is simply the best movie ever made.10/10.	10
 Not the greatest movie of all time but pretty darn good		8
 One of the best movies i have ever seen.		10
 #1 movie of all times	"I have seen this movie around 10-15 times, and every time I see it i discover something new and interesting. The story has one of the best story lines and the connection between the actors Morgan Freemam(Ellis Boyd Redding)and Tim Robbin(Andy Dufresne) is wonderful. The Shawshank Redemption shows what does go on in prison and sort of makes you think hows some normal people can become wise and crafty convicts. This movie somewhat reminds me of another great movie ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" in that the character can go from completely normal to somewhat nuts. And the cruel institutes in which people are put in, make excuses for their wrong doings, and treat people like they are dirt. I truly enjoyed this movie, and for whoever is reading this i'm sure if you see this movie, you will enjoyed just as much as i have."	10
 Great movie; take time out to watch it and learn some of life's lessons		10
 Sensitive and fascinating	"Maybe the best American movie of the 90's. No Oscar for this picture. Maybe too much good to win any prize. Frank Darabont's masterpiece is a perfect example of classical movie: without pretentious direction, without f/x, without a great budget... ""Only"" a wonderful story, a brilliant soundtrack (Thomas Newman already existed before American Beauty), a message about hope, and two monsters of the acting: Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, Red and Andy Dufresne. I didn't think a film based on a Stephen King book could be so fascinating, so sensitive, so wonderful.Enough to stay in your mind forever, and enough to cheer you up whenever you feel down.Rating: 10/10"	10
 Hope	When you get two life sentences, maybe you are in total despair especially you are innocent. But the banker Andy was not. He still had a hope for his future. He thought every possible way to get out of the prison. When the hope that recovered his innocence openly broke out, he decided to escape from the prison with his way. He was quite a smart person. Even his friend Red did not know his escape plan. He did it. So Red too. Their reunion at the beach was the warmest scene in the movie.Although the movie got many academy nominees, it got nothing in the end. However it won the heart of people. I think that its positive connotation is enough to move every one. That is why it is still so popular after 11 years. We should not abandon hope at any circumstance. Without hope, without future.Tim Robbins convincingly played the sympathizing banker. His another impressive movie was The player. Morgan Freeman should have won the academy award. If that happened, he did not have to wait 11 years to get the award (best supporting actor for Million dollar baby).A movie can bring you hope. 8/10	8
 see it once more	The first time I saw the movie I was crazy about it .I did not want to speak to anyone nor do anything .I wanted to rise my arms and cry ---yes, just like what Andy did .It really inspires me greatly .I believe it is a terrific film because it includes all things a film should have. The plot , the characters,the director,the spirits are all top.So I want to see it for another time .Then I find out that I don't like the oaks which stands for power and strength .Why can't the letter just between two brisks. It's obvious the director wanna tell us something in a obvious way. But it's not serious,this is quite personal. I still know what I can get from this movie. The more I see it ,the more I get .I know Andy deserves the happy ending ,will he succeed in the real world?	8
 Deserves 11 out of 10	This was the first movie that I remember as a little kid. When I saw it, i was captivated by the perfect acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I thought all the prisoners were actually prisoners serving life sentences. It was the first Steven King movie I've ever seen, and it gave me the wrong impression about his type of movies.The movie is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and the man she was having an affair with. Andy is sent to jail were he tries to survive a new life behind bars. The movie shows his struggles with the inmates and prison officials. His closest friend being Red (Morgan Freeman) also shares those same struggles as Andy. And the movie has the most powerful ending of any movie I've ever seen.I can say that everyone that has seen this movie truly loves it for every aspect of it. The Acting, directing, and writing, etc.	10
 The best movie I have ever seen!	The Shawshank redemption is the first Frank Darabont's movie which has taken 7 Oscar-nominations from the Academy but the film not yielded a high profit.Why not? Well,the story of this movie is too good to be true.The Shawshank redemption is based on the book by Stephen King and certainly this is the most brilliant adaptation which has ever based from the writer'novels. The playtime is rather long but seems to be not boring.It's excellently produced,and the acting(Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman)is marvellous.The script is clever enough about the human's relationships and the escape from the prison.The characters and the story itself are clearly true.	10
 I Never Cried Happy Tears After Watching Movies, Until I Saw The Shawshank Redemption		10
 You can't say enough about the Shawshank Redemption.	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the top 10 American movies ever made. It is written by American's greatest and best selling author Steven King. The acting, directing, etc., in the movie is perfect. Tim Robbins plays the perfect character in the movie and Morgan Freeman gives another stunning performance.	10
 perfection	"This is movie making at it's best. This movie has no flaws. Unlike other movies in it's category this is niether slow moving nor boring. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It has excellent characters, a moving theme, and subplots that are more intense then some movies alone. Morgan Freeman has the best narration of all narrations. The music is inspiring. I especially like the opening of the movie. Starting with his conviction then going on to Morgan Freemans character, and conecting the two with the line ""when andy dufrain asked me to get him rita haywrith, I said fine."" Then the splendid shot of the prison. (personally my favorite cinematographic achievment ever)"	10
 Wonderful!	What a complete masterpiece this film is, from the first line spoken to the zoom-out in the end. The actors are all great, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins really do outstanding performances. This is probably my all time favorite film and to anyone who hasn't seen it there's only one thing I can say: Please do! You won't be disappointed.	10
 Deserves all the credit it gets- absolutely AMAZING		10
 Perfect Pitch	An extraordinary testament to the power of hope.  In my view, the most perfectly  scripted and acted movie ever made. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that travels full circle from guilt to retribution to redemption.  In the end, the insolent and obtuse pay the ultimate  price for their arrogance.	10
 Freedom and peace	This movie, is more than just a movie, this is about freedom and peace, between each other, many people will learn something watching it, about how the mind could be free when your body is not... That´s all I have to say about the greatest movie of all times thanks if you have read my comments D@ve	10
 Fantastic	This is without a doubt, the best film of the 90's.  Morgan Freeman is brilliant as Red, his story is just as compelling as Andy Dufrense's.  Only repeated viewings made me realise this.  Another oscar tragedy that Forrest Gump won best picture over this, typical USA USA carry on.  This story also proves Stephen King as a wonderfull writer and not just a one-dimensional horror novelist.  So heartwarming, great humour particularly from the head prison guard and the best, most bitter sweet revenge in any film I can think of.  A no questions asked 10/10.	10
 Narration	What made this movie so great, was not the actors or the story, it was the narration by Morgan Freeman. His way of story telling really brought the story to life, along with great acting and a truly remarkable story by King.	10
 pure viewing pleasure, one of the best	"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give us some of the most memorable performances of all times.  In this wonderful adaptation of S. Kings short story, the human spirit and hope triumph over injustice and ""the system"". It will make you think.  No doubt this will go down as one of the best dramatic movies of all times.  I can't say too much or I will spoil it."	10
 Awesome, gripping film - gold-plated classic		10
 if only it was true	I do not know how many times I thought this film was finished and it was not - although it took a while to get into it the ending was so exceptional I`ve watched it time and time again. There were so many twists I was not expecting - the author should be applauded	10
 Uplifting and sincere		
 A very good movie	"First time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was some two years after its release. Second time was yesterday and like every great movie it got even better this time. The movie is a beautiful story about hope that holds you above the surface even when your life seems meaningless. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are magnificent, and this film I can recommend to anyone."	9
 Great film	"One of the best films of its type, only bettered by Frank Darabont's other period prison drama based on a Stephen King story ""The Green Mile"". Mr Darabont and Mr King appear to have hit on the perfect partnership, in making fantastic films based in prisons and set in days gone by. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are both excellent in this movie, although Mr Freeman is always excellent (especially in his high school drama ""Lean on me""). Well done to all concerned in this excellent production, and let's hope that Mr Darabont and Mr King continue in this successful vein for the future"	9
 FORREST GUMP AIN'T THAT BAD. . .	Well, everyone seems to mention Forrest Gump in their bit about Shawshank.So, maybe I will, too.As a Terminator 2 fan, I feel naturally fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption. This film pushes all the buttons of a person with a caring heart.With a brilliant cast, story line, director and set, this is a master piece rivaled only by T2, Titanic, The Rock, and perhaps Dances with Wolves.A 8.5/10 from MaRX.	10
 A pure masterpiece	This movie was excellence at it's best.  In my mind, it is great if you can watch a long movie and just not want it to end.  That's what this one did to me.  Besides the point that the acting was some of the best you'll see in the 90's.  The story was golden.  If you haven't seen this, get it now.	10
 A well-intentioned but unexceptional movie		
 truly amazing	What can i say?...The only film to make a grown man cry! No film comes close to this in any way or form,it draws you in from the start-keeps you there and if your like me..turns you to tears at the very last scene!.Enjoy it because no film will ever be made like this again.	10
 Great Movie? nope, there's no truth to it		
 True Masterpiece	This movie is simply the greatest.  Anybody can relate to the message of hope and the importance of freedom.  If this movie can't inspire you to live your life to the fullest, I don't know what will.  And I think all fans of this film will agree that the ending of this movie is the greatest.  I must have breathed only three times while watching that.  And critics complain that it's long.  All the great movies are though.  Anyway, whoever reads these comments and hasn't seen the film yet, go rent it.  You will not regret it.	10
 Average at best		
 good.	"I usually hate popular movies(pulp fiction, titanic, forest gump). So I was very sceptical when I sat down to watch the currently 4th ranked movie on the imdb. What can i say, I agree, this movie gets a 10, while some things are hard to believe(his escape) the range of this movie makes it easy to ignore. There is a lot of depth here. You get to see all the characters grow and age, you really get drawn in to the plot. It shows how brutal prison can be. And how dependent on the system one can become. Another minor thing I didn't like was how after ""The Sisters"" leader was beaten and transfered the prison seem to be a utopia except for the guards. There should have been at least a little inmate-to-inmate brutality shown.A great addition to your DVD collection."	10
 Wow	One of the most creative and satisfying cinematic endings.  I don't know anyone who was not touched by this movie.The story of two men, Andy Dufresne and Red, takes place inside the confined prison walls.  Their growing friendship develops into a close bond.With the desparation of prison life, the story takes a turn for the better at the end.	10
 Why so high?	This is indeed one of the best prison dramas I've ever seen. I've always been a fan of Tim Robbins and he doesn't let me down here. But I can't believe this is so high in the overall list (I would place it in the 150-200 range myself). Even if we just stick with Tim Robbins, 'The Player', 'Short Cuts' and 'Jacob's Ladder' are all far better films. It was the ending of the film that really disappointed me, but since I'm not allowed to talk about endings in these reviews I can't explain why! Suffice it to say that I can imagine at least two fairly obvious endings that would have been better. Maybe it's the 'American Factor', what with me being English, but the overrating of this film completely baffles me.	7
 Stephen King ain't just a horror novelist		10
 Hope leads everyone in life	The difference between this story about prison in the middle of the 20th Century and any other movie is just about everything.  From the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to the outstanding directing, this movie just makes the viewer feel as if they spent their time doing something worthwhile.  The ending of the movie makes the movie, but without all of the other parts leading up to the finale, there would be nothing as well. Almost every scene in this has a point and a reason.  Watching others view this movie for the first time, I've noticed that the interest is usual only at an average level during the first third of the film, but as the viewer is drawn in, they soon can't take their eyes off of it.  Only the best of movies will have all of these qualities, and with it being a happy, successful story in the end, few can deny its greatness.	10
 the best part was when...	What a great movie. It's been my fave for years but I never knew just how many other people liked it until I saw that it was ranked #1 on the top 250 list here at IMDB. It may not be the greatest movie ever made but everyone who has seen it liked it. I can't imagine anyone hating this movie. The best part of the whole movie is when Red walks down the beach in Mexico and meets his friend on the boat. You know everything's going to be okay after that.	10
 A must see film!!!	This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my seventeen years.  The movie is highly underrated by film critics, but if you look at imdb's top 250 films you will see it is rated #1.  Tim Robbins gives his best performance, he plays a prisoner who is serving time for a crime he didn't commit.  I guarantee you, you will enjoy this movie.  Check out my other reviews!	10
 The greatest film in the world (probably).	"This film ranks second among my all time favourites. The only reason it does not hold that coveted first place spot is that I am obsessed with Monty Python's ""The Holy Grail"". Shawshank is a beautifully crafted film, with one of the best endings I have ever seen; even though in a way it is not entirely unexpected. It is particularly enlivened by the presence of Morgan Freeman, who should have won an Oscar for his voice-overs alone. In a word, Exceptional."	10
 An excellent film with some deep thought provoking meanings		
 Great movie!	This film is amazing! It holds such emotional power. There is such meaning in it, and it is all captured beautifully in this movie. The fact that hope does in fact still exist! Tim Robbins, and Morgan Freeman are an amazing team in it. I loved it! Its one every movie lover, or just anyone should see!	
 Superb	"I am not a big fan of Stephen King books. Therefore, it came as a complete surprise that this compelling story was written by the ""King of Horror"" himself. Never has any other movie entertained in so many different ways. It manages to be disturbing and uplifting, both funny and moving. Morgan Freeman is top notch as usual, and Tim Robbins gives his best performance as lead character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favour and buy it from your local video store. You won't regret it."	
 Awesome	"Stephen King is my favorite writer and I've read all of his books.  When I first learned of them making a movie of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I was excited. I'd always liked the story, and thought it would make a great movie.  But I was also apprehensive, because most movies don't do the book they're based on justice, especially when it comes to Steve's books.  But I'm glad to say that I worried about nothing.  Very glad.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the very best movies from a Stephen King book ever made, and one of my favorite movies of all time.  My score-10."	
 A very good film	This is a very good film, working on a number of levels. The main theme of the film is hope in adversity. I particularly like the way that Andy becomes a kind of Christ-type. It still does not quite make my own Top Ten!	8
 Pale imitation of better films	"Three words: ""Cool Hand Luke.""  Same film, done better, done earlier.  For that matter, is this film any better than other Steven King ""novelettes"" such as ""Stand By Me""? All in all, it probably ranks a 6 or a 7, but since people on this site have lost their minds as regards this film, I give it a 1 in one man's attempt at sanity."	1
 Ho hum....	I can't say much more than I was incredibly underwhelmed by this film. Perhaps it was that I had been told what a great film it was by all and sundry, but I found it utterly average.  I am afraid I just didn't get what was so fantastic about the movie.  Don't get me wrong it was an entertaining film but not the masterpiece I was lead to believe it was. Sorry.	6
 pleasant trite verging on nauseating	this film is very convincing hokum. nice, gentle, inoffensive and insubstantial story about prison life - I came away feeling prison was a place where nobody says f##k or fears bending over to pick up the soap. check out Freeman, in the token performance of his career, neatly basking in the falsely accused smart white gentleman robbins' shaddow. what a team... so very progressive. 'hope...' . oh yeah, we've got a lot of 'hope' going on here. The lush fantasy kind, so deadly sweet and full of bull. frank darabont is a gifted man who excels in making pretty pictures that strike at the very heart of american pie values and gives them a welcome support by elevating tokenism to its greatest levels in hollywood yet - that is no small achievement, considering... if you don't believe me check out his latest masterpiece, he just can't stop doing it. hell, why not! it sells tickets.	2
 what is all the fuss about		1
 Ridiculously Overrated	This film should barely scratch out a spot in the top 250, let alone be one of the top ranked films of all time. It is rather dull, extraordinarily predictable, and filled with clichés. This is not even the best prison film, let alone #2 among all films! Cool Hand Luke or Papillon anyone? I'd give it a 7-8/10 (Freeman & Co. do not disappoint), but someone needs to bring down this bloated rating. The film is little more than a rehashing of conventional sentimentalism painted in prison stripes and sold in bulk to a (apparently) gullible audience. Help bring this down to a reasonable position so that more deserving films can attain their proper recognition.	4
 What's all the fuss?	(slight spoilers, nothing crucial) This is a competent movie, but its presence in the rankings completely baffles me -- it might as well be 'The Pelican Brief'. Its scenes are schematics into which emotion might be put (for example, the schematic of the despairing ex-prisoner Red), but they lack the ragged richness of real feeling.  Where 'Kiss of the Spider Woman' overwhelms us, this shows us a series of events.	6
 It is ordinary movie only..	"I don´t like movies about ""way of life"" or about a hope. In this movie is handled a problem with ""normal life"" or with resolution to take a life to ""own hands"". A topic of this film is such like Papillon. This is not an authentic subject, this is not an authentic movie...."	4
 No Redemption from Shawshank		4
 The Shawshank Whimpering		6
 I'll compare it to a poem		6
 Overrated, absolutely not a classic.	After seeing this movie I could not notice to be misled by the IMDB rating. The movie is nice, even good, but no way it should receive a 9.0.The movie could easily have been produced by Disney: strong moral & a happy ending. Sure, there are strong points. The scene of the old man who have been imprisoned for almost his whole life is very well placed and Tim Robbins' performance is good but the story itself does not leave anything behind. 3 out of 5. That's all there is to it.	4
 Best film ever?!		5
 Good but ludicrously overrated		6
 To predictable	WEll I had high hopes for this movie.  But it fell way short.  I was hoping it would keep me guessing, but this movie was easy to predict what was going to happen.  Though I did think the acting was good by both main stars.Jason	3
 The bathos runs thick	For the life of me, I can't understand all the gushing about this cornball, sentimental and PHONY movie.  There are certainly some strong performances, but they're outweighed by some of the two-dimensional portrayals, weak writing (that opera sequence -- oh, please) and most of all a completely garbage ending (I won't give it away) that stomps on what little credibility the movie has.I guess you really can't go broke under-estimating people's intelligence.	1
 snarling critique	awful. a dreadful disgrace. the film is the most cliched in cinematic history and is worthy of no respect. even worse is how it is so flawless yet it still is of no quality. i do not know how this film can be revered over others such as psycho, apocalypse now, raging bull, easy rider, the godfather, the killing fields, some like it hot and casablanca amongst others. shockingly horrendous	1
 Not as good as you think it is	Mostly what can been said has been said. This really isn't anywhere near he greatest movie ever made. For heaven's sake, it's a competent genre flick that runs a little too long but contains a couple of well-turned performances from the leads. Tim Robbins, incidentally, is way better in Mystic River. Down by Law and Birdman of Alcatraz are both significantly more interesting and original prison movies than this one. Cool Hand Luke is obviously the greatest prison film of all time. Shawshank is so-so. Think about it, was there a moment, a second, a single plot turn in that film you didn't know was coming? When the young guy goes out for his little conference with the warden, did you not think 'come on, guy, haven't you seen any movies?' Predictability is satisfying I suppose, in its way, but give me originality and genuine passion every time. Shawshank has neither of those attributes. Sorry to everyone who cries every time they see it. You've been had.	
 The Most Over-rated Film Ever Along With American Beauty	"O.K. you've seen the summary and you're screaming ""What kind of sour limey b@!*&%$£ says that about one of the greatest films ever made?"" Well I've got news for you, look again. The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie, i agree but is it all it's cracked up to be? - no. At first you think ""I feel great - what a feel-good movie!"" One can't help wondering that this film, on closer inspection, is actually unbelievably cheesy. Every other second i was hearing violins about how this poor guy got landed in jail for a murder he didn't commit. It's stereotypical - and you guys who voted 10 bought it hook, line and sinker. ""But what about the great twist?"" O.k., the twist was good but come on...like i said before was it THAT great? Ask yourselves honestly, was that better than The Sixth Sense's or The Usual Suspects? Also, how come foreign films which are far superior to this get no credit? Watch Le Samurai, or La Haine or Todo Sobre Mi Madre. Far more superior."	6
 An average film that does not bear repeated viewing		6
 Ghastly, Junk Film	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Shawshank"" as I'm sure it's said to death in the film is an elongated short story that just 'lingers' from one hour to the next. There's no real 'charm' to the film except of course 'dry wit' from Red as if it's the gospel according to Red. He basically plugs Andy the entire movie as if he's his agent. ""Now Andy this"" and ""Andy that"". Not to mention a walking brochure for penitentiaries ""Shawshank this"" and ""Shawhank that"" his gospel just never lets up.Now Tim Robbins was perfectly cast for about 5 minutes playing 'the babe in the woods' who ""looks like a stiff breeze would blow him over"" a ""tall drink of water with a silver spoon up his ass"". But once nothing seems to break him, its definitely a part for Mel Gibson. Tim Robbins didn't have the 'acting chops' to bring the 'required depth' to this character. Fortunate for Robbins in post production Morgan Freeman saved his ass with extensive voice overs. Most people think this was premeditated but 'the truth' is Robbins gave such a wooden performance it was necessary.Most people think this isn't your average prison drama ether because its not about violence and melodrama. But 'the truth' is this film is no better than your TV movie of the week that features a 'prison escape'. The whole 'poster thing' couldn't be more 'implausible' if an elephant hang from a cliff by a daisy. Don't let me get started on how he just happened to have the cell on the end ether! The music was 'elevator music' at best. The only time I even took notice was when they actually featured it in the plot And even then if I'd heard it id have personally punctured my eardrums. Why the 'sound' was nominated for an academy award is beyond me. If it weren't for packaging and distribution this film would be a made for TV movie. Which it was if you consider its box office taking against home rental.The entire cast reeked 'cartoon'. You have your 'evil' warden with his 'religion'. You have your 'mean' guards you 'grow to love'. Not to mention 'the kid', 'the old guy', 'the black guy' and 'the guys'. The prison was so stereotypical it even had 'fags'. Some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'harebrained'. If it was supposed to fascinate, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the mini stories unfolded was 'not stimulating'. His ability to get beers and do taxes in particular 'sucked'.In short this film 'sucked'. Worst film 'since', well since ever!"	10
 good	Good very good its a good and i aconselho a ver fdsafsadfdsafdsaf	7
 One of the most overrated films of all time	The Shawshank Redemption is an excellent example of Hollywood craftsmanship. It has believable acting, excellent pacing, good cinematography and tells the story in a very effective manner. But it is film as a craft, not as an art.To put this film in the same category as those of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Truffaut or Bergman is like comparing a piece of quality furniture to a Picasso.I doubt even one in a hundred people, who hold this film in such high regard as to vote it #2, could actually name the director if you asked them in the street.	5
 My favorite movie was The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.		8
 Greatest film of all time after Godfather	This film should be joint along with The Godfather as being the greatest film of all time. The character development and the messages that is conveying is beautifully done. When the messages such as hope, friendship and survival come together, it makes an excellent display.It consisted of different metaphors when they were drinking the liquor on top the roof, and Morgan Freeman was narrating his thoughts as feeling that they were a free man, this was the best moment of the film and made me how at that time people were living in jails.Excellent. Prefect. Outstanding film, best jail film I saw in my entire life...10/10 PS watch out for the new drama that came out in the UK... Prison Break on channel five. If you liked Shawshank then you will like this.	10
 The number one Stephen king adaption of all time.	Filmmakers that plan to make use of Stephen King's writings in the future need to pull an Orson Welles and watch this about 40 times before they get into it. And read the short story just as many times. This is the best transfer of a Stephen King story I've ever seen. I would give it to Kubrick's The Shining, but it's more like Kubrick took the story idea and did his own movie on it. In other words, while it's a classic, it's not that great of an adaption. Andy Dufresne is wrongly imprisoned for murdering his philanderous wife and while in prison befriends a prisoner named Red, who is great at getting outside products to the inmates. The message of the film is strong and clear : Hope Hope Hope is a beautiful thing. The film is about triumph. About friendship. It's also about some knockout acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at the top of their game. A Must see. Especially if you are a fan of Stephen King's short story.	10
 a perfect prison drama	The Shawshank Redemption, based on the fantastic Stephen King novel, is a moving story about Andy Dufresne, an innocent man charged with the murder of his wife and her lover who is sentenced to 40 years in prison and fights hard to survive, but in prison he forms a rare and close friendship with fellow inmate Ellis 'Red' Redding. The film more or less focuses on the friendship between Andy and Red, played beautifully by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Morgan's deep and moving voice was perfect to describe the closeness of his friendship with Andy. The film had a great happy ending where Andy escaped from the prison after serving almost 20 years, he also managed to expose the prison as there was murder and corruption going on there, Andy moves to a beautiful island abroad and when Red is paroled after serving 40 years in prison he is reunited with Andy, it was a great ending to a beautiful movie.	10
 Move down	"There is no reason for this movie to be above Citizen Kane, Godfather 2, etc.  It is a good enjoyable movie yes.  But it is also cheesy at times and a little bit pretentious. I believe what works for this movie is that it has a sort of ""everyman"" charm to it. It is a movie that an entire family can sit and watch and enjoy.  Yet, if one digs deeper into it, those that know movies should be able to see its weaknesses. Its dialogue for one is not very strong.  The performances are solid, but I believe I have seen Morgan Freeman do this role better many times before.  Is this a better prison movie than say... ""Murder in the First""? Probably, but is it sooo much better that this film deserves to be number 2 all time.  THink about that... the second best film EVER. Somehow I doubt that."	7
" Reasonably good...but far too clichéd to be called ""great"""	This movie is a fine way to spend 140 minutes, but is by no means a movie of the first rank. The script is far too simplistic, cliché-ridden and predictable. The characters are far too good guy/bad guy dualistic; and for a story purporting to take place over the course of 20 years, there is remarkably little character development. And, just about every really evil character gets his comeuppance, whereas the people we're supposed to be rooting for end up in clover. Hmmmm....Among prison movies, Cool Hand Luke is better--more realistic, and without the obligatory Hollywood feel-good ending. Runaway Train and Papillon are also very good, certainly more interesting. Among inspirational movies, last year's October Sky is a better bet.In a nutshell: tremendously overrated, but certainly worth seeing.	6
 Prison Movie???	When I signed up for the IMDB they ask you what your favourite movie is? Shawshank rose to the top of my mind immediately.  This film brought hope and inspiration to most hopeless and soul robbing of environments.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are fantastic! Does Steven King have more stories like this one?	10
 This movie takes its time.	I loved this movie! Beautifully filmed, the story is told as if time does not matter. No plot that has to be rushed through, no fast cars or anything. Just a very good story by Stephen King, marvellous actors and a lot of exciting emotions. It made me feel good to watch a man who keeps his hope for so many years.The scene with the Mozart-record broke my heart!	10
 Sometimes, we all just don't agree.		3
 What a bad movie	This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's so Hollywood cliche ! How can this be in the top 2 best movies ever ? I don't understand it. Avoid at all cost, this movie is boring !	1
 Totally Unoriginal *spoilers*	People wonder why I hate this movie so much, and I have to say that its just purely unoriginal.  I mean c'mon... how many times have you heard the story of a guy who's wrongfully accused of a crime and somehow escapes prison using a stupid spoon? If there's one thing I look for in a movie, then it's got to be originality.  I'll let it go if its based on a novel, or a musical, but c'mon... a plot this unoriginal doesn't deserve any credit!	1
 unintentionally campy trash	#2 favorite movie in the database? Mein Gott!! Surely you jest.Big-budget marquee name rip-off of the ever popular naif-in-prison B-film standard. Except the B movies don't pretend they aren't going for the shock/schlock appeal.Utter rubbish.	1
 Entertaining but still very much a piece of fiction		3
 Over-rated	I'm sorry but I just don't get the big deal over this movie. It is pure melodramatic schmaltz.  Give me Cool Hand Luke or Papillon any day.  Or how about Scum or even Chopper.I have to admit I felt the same way about The Green Mile, maybe it's just Stephen King's view of prison I don't like.  As if he has a clue!I think he should just stick with the coming of age stuff (loved Stand By Me) and the isolated looneys (The Shining), things he can obviously relate to.  Leave prison stories to the folks who actually leave their house.	5
 Why?	I don't understand why this movie is so popular.  Yes, it was an interesting movie, and it was a good movie, but it was not spectacular enough to receive all the praise which it has.  The acting was good, and the plot original, but it was still a rather ordinary movie.  Apparently, I'm the only one with this opinion...	1
 Exceptional	This film is probably the best life-in-prison film ever made.  It depicts one man's time in the big house for something he (supposedly) didn't do. This man is Andy Dusfresne (pronounced Duframe) played in his best ever, Tim Robbins.  But he isn't alone; he is joined by fellow inmate (who is the only guilty person in Shawshank) Red played also very well by Morgan Freeman. Freeman narrates the life in The Shawshank prison all the way up until the end (not to mention some very memorable escape scenes).  Very memorable, showing what movies are made of.  Based on Stephen King's novel (one of his best) and adapted for the screen and directed by Frank Darabont, who 5 years later would write and direct the Green Mile, another good (but can't be matched to this one) prison movie.  A++	10
 Total waste of time.	Well pure plain movie.BoringDullNo story at all.Plz I request all to rate 1 🌟 to movie so others don't waste their time by influence by wrong rating.	1
 Yuck	"Good cast. Good story. The performances were excellent and there was both ample food for thought, and some very good scenes. Didn't hurt that i'm a big Morgan Freeman fan. Always top notch.On the other hand, overall, the whole film was far too unpleasant, preachy, and downright repugnant, to be terribly enjoyable. When the payoff at the end finally arrived, it just wasn't grand enough to overcome the feeling i'd just crawled through the sewer.And for this to be the #1 film on IMDb (actually second, but same score as #1 and with more votes) among far superior films like ""The Godfather"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""Casablanca"", is ludicrous. This would never even have entered the remotest regions of my mind if somebody had asked me to name some really great films."	5
 Boring.	All the drama of a falling rock.  If SK lived in the Victorian Age this would be a morality play--and both would be dead and forgotten by now--just the idea of it makes me want to live another 100 years or so.	1
 sentimental garbage	"There is absolutely nothing redeeming about this maudlin Hollywood package. The storyline is predictable; the characters and performances are one-dimensional; the dialogue is absolutely embarrassing (""Prison is not a fairy tale."" Ya think?!) If it would have been about women instead of men, it would have been dismissed as the schmaltzfest that it is. It isn't even courageous enough to admit that it is a gay love story. Tim Robbins should be ashamed to have taken part, for his performance was the most wooden I'd seen since Daryl Hannah in (insert any 80s movie she appeared in here). Morgan Freeman was even more dreadful and has been giving the same dreadful performance ever since. I don't expect much depth from Stephen King-inspired movies, but ""Children of the Corn"" was insightful in comparison to this dribble."	1
 Why does everyone like it so much?	I'm sorry I don't mean to offend people who like this film but what on earth is all the fuss about over this film it is nothing compared to The Godfather and yet people vote it as second to the number 1!? The Shawshank Redemption has a relatively simple plot ,dull camera work the script is full of soppy language (thanks to the overrated Steven King)that just isn't particularly clever in any way.The atmosphere of 'prison' is totally unrealistic all the characters are wimps.The only good element is Morgan Freeman because he's a good actor.There aren't any clever twists-for instance the 'mystery' of what is in the box at the end of the film is really unoriginal. Please feel free to argue with me over this but come on people step back and look at the film what is it made up of? Then look at The Godfather look at what that is made up of - Brill cast, excellent plot, damn good script, good directing and camera work everything is perfect then look back at the Shawshank redemption its just at a completely different level. Its quite ridiculous really.	1
 It is the #2 film of all time but is it any good? No!!		1
 Overrated	"It's not a bad film.  It's just derivative and melodramatic.  It borrows from ""Cool Hand Luke,"" a superior film.  It relishes its significance too much.  It's a bit smug.  Morgan Freeman's voiceover is a clumsy narrative device.  I don't know -- I just know for sure it's not one of ""the best films of all time.""  Not even close."	1
 Clearly a rippoff, why is it rated so highly?!?!?!!??!?!	Have you ever heard of the excellent show family guy?If you havent , you clearly need to watch it cause this movie steals all of it story from the family guy episode 3 kings s 7 e 15. All the characters are clearly stolen form the amazing show, for example: red is clearly a rippoff of cleveland(from the show family guy), and Andy is a carbon copy of Peter griffin(from teh show family guy, airing on fox).If you want a real prison escape story, watch the amazing family guy episode 3 kings from season 7 episode 15 pf the amazing show family guy here is a link to the amazing episode.	1
 The Shawshank Redemption Review - An Overrated Good Film	The Shawshank Redemption is certainly a good film, and deserves recognition for its sincerity. However, it does not deserve the number 1 spot on 's list of greatest films. There are too many imperfections in this film for it to be regarded as 'the greatest movie of all time.'Top 100? Sure. Number 1 Absolutely not.	6
 Absolutely overrated.	A very boring and very predictable story.I can not understand why this movie is so hyped.	6
 an alright movie to watch		5
 Have we gone over the top with this film?	Many folk rate Shawshank Redemption as one of the best films they have ever seen. I'm not so impressed. Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh. Is it just that the film is a lot better than the story from which it is taken? Rita Hayworth: eat your heart out?	6
 Very good movie, still overrated!!!	The story's quite plain, the acting is OK but nothing really over the top, even though the soundtrack, the quality of the shots and the atmosphere really stood out! I think it's for obvious sentimental reasons that people like this movie! The good guy takes a lot of crap but wins in the end because he's smart!! There are way better movies than this one and I really can't understand why so many people rate it 10!! 10 equals perfection and very few pieces of art come close to it!! I think 7 is a very high rating and this movie probably doesn't deserve more than an 8 maximum!! The masses don't necessarily appreciate subtle art and want to be entertained, that's what the movie industry is about! Still, this movie was quite gay! Way too much emo and way to predictable!	6
 Subtlety, and the Lack Thereof		4
 Good, but great?		5
 Yawn	I cannot believe that this movie has rec'd the accolades it has. I thought was mediocre at best and at worst saccharin, predictable, neatly cathartic and only mildly believable. I think that if it didn't contain the rape scenes, it would have been so sweet that I would have turned it off before I regurgitated. This is not to say that I enjoyed those scenes - I didn't - but it appeared that it was Frank Darabont's sophomoric attempt at instilling some sense of prison reality into an otherwise boring story about male bounding. I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone.	6
 don't be silly	having this movie in your top ten best films of all time is like saying the greatest pieces of art ever painted are the ones they put on hotel walls. Maybe this is true in a sort of egalitarian, democratic and mind-numbingly banal way. A thoroughly ordinary film, that has been embraced by men who want to cry, have faith, and have equilibrium. Which is nice.	6
 Definitely on my top 1000 list	I hadn't seen this film until today and I never would have rented it if I hadn't seen that it was so high up on the top 250. It wouldn't have been a great loss. It's a pretty good movie, but a bit sappy for my taste. Gives you lots of warm feelings inside about persistence through adversity, hope, friendship and all that good stuff. If you're into that, it is very well put together and it features some good acting and a beautiful score. Oh, and -- this could be considered a SPOILER given that it's a prison movie -- the ending is so nice and so predictable and so cute and so corny, it just hurts. Art, it is not.	6
 Good but not great	The good points of this movie have already been stated in the other posts, so I will stick to the points I feel detracted from the movie. This movie never gripped me, I never really felt all that emotionally involved with the characters.  Even though 19 years passed in the story, I never got the sense of time passing as I have in other movies that have storylines that span decades.  All the characters who weren't prisoners were very one-dimensional.  Overall, it was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it belongs in the top 250.	5
 Why is it rated Number 1?	I don't understand how this movie managed to get to Number one on this site. While it's a good movie with talented actors, it's just not as entertaining and solid as other movies that i believe deserve the top ranking. I enjoyed watching it, and it really doesn't deserve the 1/10 rating I've given it (thats only to bring it lower on the top 250) it just isn't as good as other movies I have seen and loved such as 'Trainspotting', 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Donnie Darko' for example. These movies are solid performances with a strong theme in one direction, while I feel that The Shawshank Redemption flounders around with it's, slightly lame, hope and friendship theme, thats just not as entertaining as others.	1
 Brutal Anti-Bible Bigotry Prevails Again		4
 Unbearably dull	I can't think of any movie more monstrously overrated than The Shawshank Redemption. Giving it only one star may seem harsh but considering all the undeserved praise heaped on this mediocre and dull movie I think it's fair. I watched it on TV and it is good enough for some entertainment for a few hours if you're too tired to do anything else but that's about it. It is predictable and unimaginative: innocent guy (well we never learn if he is if I remember correctly but as he is such a nice fellow we're supposed to think so), sexually assaulted, escapes and there you have it and that's all there is to it. Of course Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are good actors but I can't think of anything more nice to say about this movie.	1
 Not a bad movie, but also not a very entertaining one	The problem with this movie is that it is to ordinary. It seems like the movie is just a cheap feelgood flick that has an ending that is easily predicted. I didn't care much for the characters and the narration was pretty annoying. I've read the book and it's a good adaptation. See it if your a Stephen King fan or like Dramas.	1
 Review Redux	In my original review, I said that I didn't hate Shawshank as much as I hated the fanbase for making it the most overrated movie ever made. On rewatching the movie, my opinion of it is lower than ever. Nevermind how Andy's escape thru the sewage pipe doesn't make much sense (during the rain storm it would've been filled with water and he wouldn't have been able to get in, assuming that in real life they even had pipes people can fit into, or how anyone could reach Mexico from New England while there's a massive manhunt for them (which is called off unrealistically quickly) despite only a few hour head-start, and how in the hell does he just walk into a bank and walk out? His picture would be circulated by then)), everything about the movie rings hollow and false; it is Hollywood escapism at its cheapest and most artificial. I felt as nonplussed by it as ever - well, that's not true - the movie is supposed to be about hope and all that typical toddler b.s., but on this viewing I found it incredibly depressing. The movie is extremely depressing when you really watch it, but everyone always focuses on the cheesy, artificial fake fantasy ending, so they forget the bleakness of the rest. It's all the more infuriating when you hear of real-life stories like Benjamin Spencer, a man who 30 years ago was falsely imprisoned and years later, even after he was proven innocent, thru a loophole, they still have him locked up to this day, which makes me even more fed up with this childish b.s. complete crap movie for the masses. Or how about all those innocent people who died in the Nazi camps? No escape for them. The more you compare this melodrama to real life, the more infuriatingly empty it is. Also, Andy's escape feels completely unearned. You don't actually get a sense of Andy's suffering (he's unrealistically nonplussed by just about everything. He feels like a cardboard stand-in). For instance, he gets sent to the hole a lot, but the movie glosses over it - he locks himself in warden's office and Morgan just gives a one line narration of how he got sent to the hole for a week, but it just instantly cuts to him joining them for lunch. The only time you see him in solitary is when warden opens the door to talk to him later on in a brief 30 second scene. That's it. It's not like Papillon where you actually spend time with Steve McQueen in the hole and you actually see him breaking down, getting lines on his face, palpable distress worsening over time. You don't get that sense with Shawshank that just glosses over all that. Also, Andy's escape feels like a cheat - warden pulls away the poster and the hole is just there, despite us never seeing Andy working on it. It's not like Escape From Alcatraz where the whole movie is planning the escape and you actually feel the tension of times when Eastwood is nearly caught working away in his cell. In Andy's cell, the hole just magically appears there, since the movie never even indicates its existence - that's not a twist, that's a cheat. Warden pulling back the poster and seeing this tunnel there is the equivalent of how in Northwest Hounded Police, the Wolf takes a pencil and literally draws a door on the wall and just walks out. I heard prisoners like this movie well enough, but I would venture that's because of the escape fantasy they can relate to, not because it's a good movie. You can show inmates a poorly acted, shot, edited, prison break-out movie and they would still probably applaud if the character escapes. What does this even add to the prison genre? It's better than most prison movies, but what does it add?	5
 The 1st Greatest Film of All Time	They say there are no perfect movies. Most of the time that holds true. But this is the one exception. I find no faults in The Shawshank Redemption. It is indeed a perfect film if ever there was one. It is wildly entertaining and extremely insightful. You won't want to blink for fear of missing something. You are able to identify and sympathize with the main character, and with his friend, who provides the greatest bits of narration of any film ever. This is not an exaggeration. Furthermore, we learn something about ourselves and our fellow human beings by watching this film. It is a work of art and a bit of real life. The production values are amazing. It should have won ten Oscars.	10
 My first review	"So simple, don't do like me and waste 2 years saying ""meh I'll watch it anothertime"" just watch it when you find it! You will enjoy it"	10
 hi		10
 An Incredibly Overated Film	"This is why I have a problem with IMDB. They rated this film as the #1film of all time. Are you kidding me? It wouldn't make it into my top 50. Why? Because they are like the ""Peoples Choice Awards"". How about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Wizard of Oz"", or any film Stanley Kubrick made from ""The Killing"" (1956) forward. They are all an order of brilliance above this film. Yes, it is entertaining and good, but I can't stand a monologue that is simply repeats what has already been shown on the screen. It is ridiculous to do that. Why? Because Morgan Freeman is simply a narrator for what you are watching on the screen, like a football play by play announcer. Very overrated. I gave it an 8 when it really deserved a 7 (at best). The people at IMDB think a comic book film is great. What are they; pre-teens?"	8
 .	Most beautiful movie i have ever seen in my life i love morgan freeman and tim robins acting in this movie.	10
 Overrated	The most overrated movie ever. A classic? Yes. A masterpiece? Maybe. Best movie ever? Hell no.	6
 Best movie ever	Absolute best movie I have ever saw. Hands down the acting is out of this world and the story is amazing. I felt that Tim Robbins performance was perfection. I thought all of the other characters were very believable in their respective roles, from Red being the guy who can get things to Brooks, who played the best character as the man afraid to reneter civilization after a lifetime behind bars.	10
 What is all the fuss about?	SR is a good film. In my view it is not a great film! Firstly - it is lazy film-making to have a character (Red, in this case, played by Morgan Freeman) as a narrator to tell us what is happening. The film itself should convey the narrative. If someone has to read the narrative I might as well just buy the book!Secondly - the story is simply not believable! I can't believe that a prisoner gets to do all the tax returns for the guards and governor. I can't believe that a prisoner entering the prison just happens to have a heard another prisoner in another prison boast about committing the murder for which our hero is serving time. Thirdly - the story all ends up 'happy ever after' which is seldom the case but which, I suppose, satisfies those of a simplistic/idealistic nature. I prefer more grit and realism.Fourthly - the 'goodies' (Dufresne, Red, Brooks) and the 'baddies' (Bogs, Hadley, Norton) are drawn so simplistically they might as well have been wearing white and black hats! There is no depth of character here.Fifthly - and most damning - this film made me feel very little! I didn't really care about the characters (except - maybe - Red). The plot with Dufresne taking on his alter-ego on escape was clever and the suicide of Brooks was a bit moving but this was not enough for me. I go to the cinema to be moved by the plot or the characters; to be made to think; or simply to laugh! This was not a laughing film but neither did it reach me on any other level.It was also too long!	6
 Please Ignore This Review	"Please Ignore This Review. Sorry To Waste Your Time Everyone. This is a test. I need 10 lines of text so I am going to write as much as I can. I feel like I am writing a school paper, as this is how I always waste space. But hey, as long as it's 10 lines, right? So since I'm here and if you're still reading, let me tell you about my day. I went to work today and earned some extra cash. Who doesn't love extra cash? I mean, come on! This is America, people! If you don't love extra cash, then you're not American! Anyways, I went to work today and then after that I went home and checked some stuff off of my checklist, after which I am writing this review. I never did tell you why I needed ti write this review, did I? I probably should, as not to completely waste your time (although I've wasted it a lot already). I am writing this review because IMDb wants me to do a checklist of things to ""Complete My Account"". It's really stupid if you ask me, but I've now written more that 10 lines of text so I will bid you farewell :)"	
 Shawshank Overrated	This film is very overrated by seemingly sensible people. It is a remarkably emotional film on a par with various pulpy Catherine Cookson films. Talking of pulp, Pulp Fiction is awesome in comparison, as is The Shining. That Shawshank is voted Number One on many movie charts, is absolute madness. I have seen it on various occasions and via various media. And I cannot work out why people have it in such high regard. Over. Rated. Fact. Also, the film has no air of being cool or stylish in any way - it has no wow-factor of great cinematography in the way a film like Let The Right One In has for example. It has no black humour. It is tame by comparison to other films. It has no astounding scenes which Pulp Fiction has by the truckload. It has no atmosphere which a film like The Shining has by the snow-plough load. Shawshank at Number One - Absolute Madness.	6
 There is definitely no better movie...	"There are only a few words I have to say: Every time I watch that film, I have to cry. There are not many films, which get this result. Must have something to do with the direction of Frank Darabont. And the acting of the stars is just brilliant. As a matter of fact, I don't see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins playing just another role. I only see two Persons: Andy and Red For a long time I had the problem that when I saw Tim Robbins in another movie I thought of Andy Dufresne But now I will write something about the story: Of course I have read the original story written by Stephen King. It was, in a way different. It has not that deep meaning that is perceptible in the movie. When I think about this friendship between the two men... The sentence ""Get busy livin or get busy dyin"", well in a way it shaped my whole live. This is definitely the best film I have ever seen"	10
 Too Good	This movie has many stories to tell. Every scene has its own story. I like the way Morgan freeman narrates in the movie which makes it all the more interesting. The scene where Andy gets beer for his coworkers. Also when he plays the two Italian singers on prison radio. Brooks last few days.And how Red comes to terms with his freedom. I recently watched it for the first time and can't believe how i could miss this for so long. I Also cant believe Morgan never won Oscar for this. I cant think of any better performance than this.Truly deserves the number one spot. Since last week i have watched it 3 times and plan to watch it again. Thank you Frank Darabont for giving us hope.	10
 My best Film ever	"This film touches me. I believe it's the greatest film because I has an effect on people's lives. We watch a lot of films everyday but hardly we refer back to them.This is a film I apply in everyday life. Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. The part I liked most is when Red said ""some birds are not meant to be caged; they'll fly away and when they do, that part of you that knows it was a sin to have locked them up does rejoice...""Indeed we should build our lives such that circumstances cannot cage us. All the while Andy was in the prison, his mind was outside.Indeed, salvation lies within...."	10
 Unpredictable!	when i began to watch this movie,i just said to myself,this should be the best i ever saw in my life,judging the IMDb rating and Kinopoisk rating!and it really haven't disappointed me! i learned,that if you want something so much,and the wish to achieve a thing or to get something is bigger and greater than anything else,this will obviously happen! there is nothing more important than to believe in yourself,to believe in justness, in the right choice of destiny! there are things that i disliked in the movie,but those awesome moments just overcome all the misses! I'm gonna watch it again...cause there still remain a lot of meanings and messages that i must follow! Hope is the best thing that can ever happen to you! never loose it!	10
 Best ever...	"I saw this film back in '95 in Romania. Funny thing - it's translated title there was ""Angels' Prison""...I don't if it's the best ever made, for sure it's the one I liked the most. the film is about friendship - one thing who became pretty rare nowadays - and is simply magic, don't have any other words to add except that I've logged in on IMDb' site just to be able to vote and make sure it stays no. ONE. So it had 7 Oscar nominations, walked away with nothing. That tells me nothing folks, I only remember the emotions I experienced when I saw it. I'am not a touchy one but Shawshank did it for me, big time. And one final word, please don't forget Stephen King in all this, just because he had commercial success doesn't mean he's not great."	10
 Jaw-droppingly Great Film - At the Top of Everyone's List!		10
 Simply !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		10
 The Best movie of all time	If there's one surefire movie every person can agree on, it's the shawshank redemption. while it was originally a novel, it evolved into what the IMDb considers the best movie of all time, ranking #1 in the IMDb top 250.Young man Andy Dufresne is framed and cast into Shawshank Prison, The 2nd worst prison in all of America (number one being Alcatraz) While being in the prison, he's sexually molested by insane inmates, Beat up by Heartless and immoral guards, and his experience as a banker taken advantage of by the warden. But through it all, Andy manages to keep hope through a fear that keeps all of his fellow inmates Prisoners.All i can say is, Watch this film.10/10	10
 The best movie of all time!!!!!	"Oh my God, I no doubt about it, love this movie more than any other I've ever seen!!!!! I mean, the script is just breathtakingly brilliant, and the acting was superb, PERFECT even. I can watch this movie any time of the day, because it never gets old and I never like it less. I am so glad to know that it is highly appreciated on here as well, and it needs to be, this movie KICKS ASS!!!!! If you're a hater, you don't know what a good movie is, and get a life, but if you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY, ""HIGHLY"" recommend you see it right away for you have missed out on something special your entire laugh, and truthfully, that makes me sad. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION IS TRULY THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!"	10
 When was the last time you saw a great movie???	My friend asked me that question and I said... TODAYI saw The Shawshank Redemption today, yes nearly after 14 years it was released and after 26 years of my life on earth... I should have seen it much before, I guess. I am truly moved by the story and more than that by the character roles played by Morgan (Red) and Tim (Andy). I have to admit, this is not one of the greatest, BUT THE GREATEST movie ever produced.Brooks was there, so was Red... I wish I was also there to see it for real.This movie gave me new avenues, new thoughts, new energy and more than everything... it gave me what it gave Morgan Freeman... HOPE	10
 Simply Incredible		10
 Best movie ever.	Ill make this short. I got two versions of this DVD in my collection, in case one of them gets broken.Excellent acting by Robbins and Freeman, plus all the other bi-characters. Thomas Newman's music in the background makes the moments so sore and intense that you forget everything else. Some critics might say its a sentimental cry-baby movie, but forget about it. Ask the biggest moron you can find on a monster-bike and ill bet he remembers this movie.If you haven't seen the movie, go see it. If you have seen it, go see it again.	10
 Simply perfect!	I think its obvious to anyone that has seen this movie that its quite possibly the best film ever. Its just perfect, iv watched it so many times but its gets better every time, in fact the last time i watched it, it brought a tear to my eye just as it finished.

" ""The Movie Of the Millennium""- A True Masterpiece"		10
 Simply stunning	After you finish this film you will set in front of your screen and your tongue will get stunned you will feel that the world doesn't exist and the film will control your brain as a toy this is a film combining thinking great emotions and the unexpected and traitors some gun shooting some comedy if I would do something I would go to the creators of the film and make them some status and write there names in the books of history . Morgan freeman played acted the film of his life All cast are masters they did deal with black magic or something if you didn't see that movie go buy it's DVD right now or I will come and kill you for not seeing that master piece	10
 Perfect Film!		10
 Tale of a man who makes the prison, a better place to live.	In my personal view, any person in the world who understands English, would never say some thing wrong about this movie. If some does understands English and still says something wrong about this movie, it means he has not seen the movie. If some one understands English and has seen this movie as well, and still he says something bad about this movie, it means he has a really bad taste regarding movies or he does not know what a movie is. (According to me, these kind of people should be hanged to death) This movie has changed the life of thousands of people around the world. I don't think that any one having a little bit of intellectual level would dislike this movie.	10
 Good, but not great - grossly overrated		7
 A true masterpiece	I would recommend this movie to everyone. The acting, directing, cinematography are all top notch. The cast are so good that its hard to imagine anyone else in those roles. If this movie does not make you laugh and then at, the very least, make you cry a little bit, then you have no soul.The greatest movie never to have won an academy award - no doubt. The greatest movie of all time - possiblyIf you have never seen this movie you are lucky, because i will never again be able to see it for the first time.A truly heart-warming and inspiring piece of cinema. Awesome	10
 Amazing!!		10
 One of my all-time favourite movies		10
 HOPE IS THE BEST THING!		
 Very well but far from a masterpiece	Strong, meaningful and everlasting message is what makes this movie such powerful. The Hope, the Life and the Friendship are elements of Great Impact and are well incorporated in this feature. But, lots of flaws also. This movie lacks originality. Approach, characters and dialogues are rather cliched and mold. Portraying of characters is loose and poor. Dialogues are pretty ordinary and too conventional. Overall approach is just Routine and  the whole movie is based on the Final Impact of  the story. In short, its actually not surprising no Oscar winning and no including into the 100 Greatest Movies by American Film Institute. Greater Effort in developing characters to be multidimensional and story to be less conventional would produce One of the Best. Pity. 7,5/10	7
 Where are the risks?	Many reviews talk about how they don't have words that can describe this movie.  I have the perfect word: vanilla This movie is the Toyota Camry of movies.  Pleasant, but bland.  It doesn't take any risks, just plays it safe and the result is a pleasant experience, but not a satisfying one. I would have liked to see more risks taken.  How about some ground-breaking cinematography?  What if some of the characters pushed the envelope a little further?  Far enough to be accused of overacting by some?  How about a parallel story?  How about SEVERAL parallel stories? What about moving the story at a faster pace?  The beginning of the movie was really quite slow...There is no reason this movie should be more than 2 hours.  I give it only a 7 out of 10 for breaking no new ground.  I think this movie fails to distinguish itself in my memory.	7
 My Review of this Great Movie	Well there's not much you can say about this movie except that it is the Best movie of all time and no other Movie will top this great Great movie If you have not seen it sit back clear your mind and watch it and make sure you are not bothered while watching it that way you can fully understand the film and its purpose.So out of a 1-10 scale I give it a 10+++++++ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN IT RENT IT!!!!!!!!	10
 ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE DECADE		10
 The book was better	This wasn't a bad movie by any means, in fact it was pretty good. Good story, good acting, fairly dramatic, it has most of the key elements in place. But after reading the book, which was amazing, watching this drawn out film version just isn't the same. Compared to some of the modern junk that's out there, Shawshank is pretty solid. But overall, it truly is overrated, and #2 all time is silly.	7
 The last person to see this film (Probably)	Well now I've finally seen it, and I have to say after the tremendous build up from everyone I've spoken to (IMDB No.2!) etc.. I thought it was ..... OK.  I think I would have scored it higher if I'd seen it five years ago but now without nostalgic hindsight it's only a 7!! Shock.. This film is still well worth seeing but the characters are not as well crafted as in 'The Green Mile' nor do they command your compassion (Brooks excepted).I suppose I'd better see 'Hannibal' SOON!	7
 A fine movie, but a few things bug me.		7
 Quite simply the best film I have ever seen.	This film is truly magnificent and if there is anyone out there who hasn't seen it they should get straight down to their local video shop and buy it because it is the sort of film that you will want to watch over and over again.  There is no acting in any other film that comes close to Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman.  I fail to see how anyone could fault any part of this film it is, in my opinion, perfect.  The plot line is great and there is no way you could guess what is coming next and the ending is completely unpredictable.	10
 **1/2 (Out of four)		5
 Fun is here	I sure whenever i saw this, i feel the fun and act. The real fun is here without any action. Everyone on this earth has their own freedom.	10
 Never Forget	This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	10
 Worth watching over and over	The level of the plot is clear, stable and smooth, the actors are full and three-dimensional, and any line can become a constant word. People with dreams have their own halo and always keep a distance from the chaotic world. At the same time, they are clear-minded, uncompromising, confident, and always have longings and hopes for a better future. Every time you read a classic, it is a process of soul purification. It is like a sweet wine with a mellow entrance and a long aftertaste.	10
 flawless	It's a movie about hope,freedom and friendship, that's what we need.	10
 Eternal Classics	Everyone lives in a kind of Shawshank prison, with all kinds of squeezing, physical and spiritual interlocking, breaking this and that.But with hope, there is peace of mind and belonging, because life is either busy living or busy dying.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	It's a good film that has no hostess, no love and no stunt. It's also a film that many college English teachers like to show to their students. It tells a very pure story. It's a redemption, in exchange for freedom. It's also a belief that drives him to do so. It's a touching film, which also makes many people grow up.	9
 Never give up	I was deeply impressed by this film. Nothing can stop us from chasing what we want.	10
 great	At that time, it was rare to be framed in prison to have faith and stay awake, because day-to-day work in prison really destroyed people's hopes. But the man is the one who is awake, and he redeems himself and others, Let other people's world t also more excellent color.	10
 A movie you may regret not watching !	The film provides an excellent experience for the viewer and is considered one of the few films throughout history that you may regret if you do not watch it	7
 the best of the best	The best movie ever .after all this years it still in the throne	10
 This had me on the 'Feels Train'	What an amazing film! There are not enough words to describe the pure artistry in this. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely my favorite film.The acting, and the narration truly pulls you in. Watch it NOW!	10
 Life lessons	This movie is a wake up call for everyone: so many life lessons, so many quotes that will remain forever in your mind. The acting is amazing, the story, the script, the music. Everything is just perfect'Get busy living or get busy dying'	9
 Excellent	Best Movie,The Direction Adaptation and Film Portrays the story is Auwsome...However the arrival of anothe inamte is going to vastly change things for allthere was no fanfare out for the release of the Film back in 94	10
 Shawshank	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	9
 An Epic that will Leave you Speechless		10
 ok	TriviaThe film's seven Academy Award nominations didn't include Production Design	10
 Wonderful	Everyone is his own god. and only he can save himself.	10
 not bad	Yes I like it but ,I cant say. that is a perfectly perfect movie	8
 The greatest movie based on a novel by Stephen King	"IntroductionThis film, The Shawshank Redemption, featuring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is an American jail show. It depends on a novella by Stephen King. It depicts the account of a fruitful broker who proves the brutalities and misuses held in penitentiaries.Andy Drusfene, a blameless man, has been indicted for killing his companion and her darling after his (Andy's) disclosure of the issue. Shawshank is a jail, and the name reclamation is utilized to catch the expectation in the film.Expectation reveals insight in Andy's life, and he battles for two decades realizing that he will escape from jail and become fruitful. Andy eagerly pauses, and he doesn't lose trust in the entire of his jail life. Indeed, Andy imparts trust in his individual detainees, and his expectation wins him trust with the jail specialists.At its start, the film includes a few scenes of the evening of the homicide by giving a diversion of occasions all through the preliminary being held in a court. The film is introduced as a relating of Andy's life in jail being told by Ellis Redding-""Red"", a criminal prisoner, who turns into Andy's actual buddy and faithful companion.Origination of Andy's HopeAndy is persuaded of his guiltless, and he realizes that, at some point, he will be liberated. Andy says that he adored his significant other; he didn't slaughter her. Be that as it may, conditional proof follow up on his ruin and Andy is detained for twofold homicide. He continues alluding to life outside the jail, and a few prisoners feel that Andy should quit pondering opportunity.Andy accepts that the jail can deny him opportunity, yet jail can not deny him trust; truth be told, trust is the main thing that can't be taken from somebody. For example, Andy reveals to Red that he tunes in to Mozart in his mind. He discloses to Red that a few spots are not worked with stone, and the psyche is one of these spots; trust reestablishes one's confidence throughout everyday life.He doesn't get debilitated when Red reveals to him that expectation is a hazardous thing. He puts stock in something contrary to what Red says. He likewise tells Heywood and Red that they will like a book, The Count of Monte Crisco, since it is about jail break. This shows Andy has any expectation of getting away from jail no matter what. Actually, this goes about as a hunch of Andy's later getaway from jail.Expectation in PrisonThe Shawshank jail is an establishment of remorselessness where prisoners are beaten, starved and manhandled. The superintendents do this trying to cloud the redemptive intensity of expectation from the brains of prisoners. This technique is effective, and a great deal of detainees, in Shawshank, are sad.Andy figures out how to fit in this setting by giving financial favors to the jail superintendent and the jail monitors. This moderate story of mercilessness and misuse sums up the subject of the path survived the film. This path is portrayed by the promoting trademark held for the film; dread can hold one hostage, however expectation can liberate one.Andy, a sly ex-financier, find out about cash than anybody in the jail. He is likewise ready to recognize the shortcomings in individuals and utilize these shortcomings to his advantage. Andy, through his cunning methods, wins the trust of jail superintendents; he is taken from the clothing division to the library.In the library, Andy has a few benefits denied to different detainees. He deals with the jail's money related issues, and he is utilized (by certain superintendents) to propel some degenerate arrangements for their benefit. Be that as it may, Andy isn't silly, and he ensures he makes enough provisos that make the superintendents, one after another in future, got.A snapshot of extraordinary expectation comes when Tommy, a kindred detainee, accompanies a story of blamelessness that could liberate Andy. Be that as it may, the degenerate jail specialists are not finished with Andy yet; they need to keep laundering cash. Consequently, the Warden has Tommy executed with circumvent being utilized as a spread. This is done to slaughter Andy's expectation, however this doesn't break Andy's will of getaway; the jail couldn't remove trust from him.Andy would like to live in a celebrated Pacific waterfront town, in Mexico. He realizes he will escape from jail, and, at once, he discloses to Red that he is confident for this fantasy. In any case, Red considers the to be as unreasonable. Inevitably, this fantasy becomes, and Red, after his discharge, goes to look for help from Andy in the named Mexican town.Andy's EscapeAndy's incredible save of persistence and courage causes him succeed. By getting away from Mr. Norton's statement of misuse and debasement, he guarantees recovery, yet not before he figures out how to divulge the brutalities, misuse and degenerate business being held inside Shawshank.To do as such, Andy goes from being a legit, moral man to a hooligan who utilized all his insight and aptitudes as an instrument of barrier. The hero figures out how to pick up Norton's and the institutional gatekeeper's regard; in this manner, he adds to the advancement of detainees and assumes a key job in the jail network.Andy utilizes a stone sledge (secured by Red) to burrow a passage through which he get away. Indeed, this part shows the climax of Andy's expectation. This is on the grounds that he has burrowed the passage for near two decades; this is an exceptionally aggressive caper.At this point, Andy has aggregated enough cash to assist him with beginning another life. He likewise has data that uncovers the condition of mistreatment in Shawshank. This data prompts the capture of Hadley, yet Norton ends it all.Basic StandpointThe film takes the watcher through a state of self disclosure in that it shows a man who won't lose trust. The film shows the shamefulness of the equity framework; rather than being the guide of equity, the framework leads in violating the law.The watcher gets a perspective on life past jail dividers, and the watcher likewise questions the legitimacy of equity in such conditions. Be that as it may, trust hangs out in this film, and the watcher feels that there is some expectation that the circumstance can be adjusted.EndAndy's expectation sees him through jail life. This expectation drives Andy to do heaps of things, and finally, gets away from jail; he trusts that two decades will make his turn, and when he does, he moves from jail as an effective man. He utilizes his money related astuteness to make things work for him. Actually, he likewise reestablishes trust in different detainees."	9

Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement.

 The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbin	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	9
 One of the best ever	"Hope, endurance, and unconditional friendship are core themes of the film. Corruption, manipulation, and betrayal are also present, but they're shown to fail in the end. The problem of ""institutionalization"" is shown and discussed -- a prison inmate has spent so much time in prison, he has forgotten how to live outside the prison walls. Integrity and perseverance are major themes."	10
 cool	Pretty cool yahooPretty cool yahooPretty cool yahooPretty cool yahooPretty cool yahooPretty cool yahoo	9
 Finally watched this after 26 years.	With thousands of reviews already, the only thing I can add is that I'd always put off sitting down to watch this film. But after watching it, I really can't fathom why. The reviews and ratings obviously make this a great flick and the cast alone is enough to warrant a look for virtually everyone. Yet, I seem to have always found something else to watch instead and I'm kind of regretting doing so.Long story short, if you've waited longer than me to check this out. Put the phone down and press play. You won't be disappointed.	10

 Best film so far	One of the most beautiful film I have ever seen. Great characters, unexpected twists, and well-developed dialogues till the last moment. The film processes great personalities through hope, friendship and redemption. Well structured story, amazingly lit frames!	
 Eternal Classics	The most powerful note about hope.Good movies, like good songs, will not be forgotten with the passage of time.On the contrary, every time we watch and listen, we will have new harvest and different experience.From the first time I saw it, to the time when the negative frustration came,I always turn on this movie to get the courage and strength to face life.	10

 Amazing	I have to be honest, this is probably one of the best movies I've ever seen!	10
 Zihuatanejo	Woow, what a movie, what a story! I have seen this 3 times, second time I was around 20 and I can say this movie has so much to say. Much more after 10 years I am almost 30. I have learned from this much, at least do not stop to sending letters... There is always hope. The only excuse that this did not win awards is the Forrest. Zihuatanejo.	10
 Three words: Oh. My. God.	How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words?	10
 Best of the Best	The Shawshank Redemption has great performances. This is movie is a best ever!	10
 Amazing	Best movie ever 👌 Amazing actors they should still be getting awards for this movie.	10
 Constant	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	
 Hope can drive a man insane	It is obvious that hope is double edged sword but hope in this story supported the main man to face all the difficulties. Our guy made such a choice, never lost hope. If I were I would feed the crows. Therefore, you can escape from prison but you cannot escape from captivity.	9
 My best	I watched it when I was a kid.Still loving this.Stephen King is awesome.The Movie is awesome.I think everyone must see this movie.	10
 Most Underrated Masterpiece Ever	As far as I know, there's only few people know the existence of this movie.

 It Checks All the Boxes	I love when stories provide all the answers towards the end of the film.Shawshank Redemption does exactly that and more.It has a feel good story, with amazing plots and twists, while also serving up suspense and entertainment.The filmmaking is tremendous, as well. And if I were to have a favorite scene in all of movie history, it would be when Andy falls out of the sewer pipe after crawling in filth to then scream in joy while rain pours on him. It symbolizes more than just escaping prison.Such a beautiful scene.	10

" ""Get busy living or get busy dying."""	"The best movie I have ever seen.This movie reminds me of the story of a bird inside the cage waiting for the day of freedom to hover into the sky. The case is the same for Andy. This movie made me imagine a situation where there seems no hope in life at all. But as Andy said, ""There's always hope.""I get to find the truth that even a single person can lead to change. From this movie, you can know about yourself and attain a successful journey.Whenever we confront adversities, let's lead like a game-changer while enjoying our personal growth.I recommend you to watch this movie as I loved it."	10

 The Shawshank Redemption	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	7

 The Best	One of the best ever , wish to see alot of movies like that	8
 Absolute pleasure	This is not about a movie but also emotion. I most certainly like this movie .	10
 The Best Movies I've ever seen	Why The Shawshank redemption is a good movie to watch even if you're new to these films industries? it's because all the plot have a twist, so the viewer can't expect how the ending will be. I suggest you to watch this film before you gone to heaven. Nice Job!-Susetio Cahyadi	10
 Nice	This film is very good and pleases me. it would be great to add some of the best actors and actresses in the country.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	I saw it a long time ago. What impressed me was that an old man didn't know how to live after he was released from prison. Everything outside was unfamiliar to him. He couldn't work, communicate and live normally. Finally, I choose to end my life. Habit is really an extremely powerful and terrible power!	9
 Brilliant,exciting,gripping	A most excellent film...watched many times. Never fails to be to enthralling	10
 Hope is a Good thing.	Hope is a good thing as said by Andy and I hoped that I will like this movie again rewatching it after years. It still does , like s charm. No action , No VFX, No ott moments still in the 2020's this works like old wine. That moment when Andy breathes a sign of relief in the rain after escaping still gives you reason to live your life for. The climax too. After all these years it is surprising that the film didn't win a single Oscar award ,even though it stand against had equally great films ( eg- Forrest Gump ), but it doesn't matter now though ( but it also gives an idea on what a splendid year 1994 was for movies). What this has done in the future is history and it has emerged as one of the greatest movies ever made and ya it is still the highest rated movie on IMDb and I would still want to watch it again after few years to stay motivated in my life...	9
 Great	Honestly, it's a perfect movie and this is my 7th time to watch it.it's really great to watch such a movie, thanks!	8
 Best movie I have ever seen!	I don't have many words for this film but trust me when I say that this will be in your top 3 movies ever without a doubt.GO WATCH THIS MOVIE NOW!!!	10
 sup	Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy i really i like this movie i thi nk it will be a good movie for you try it out	8
 A one-of-a-kind movie you will NEVER forget in your lifetime.	No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never get over it. A genuine and absolute outlook on life and death, freedom and captivity, friend and foe. A perfect score is what the Shawshank Redemption will always deserve. Its idea will never die.	10
 10/10 movi	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	10
 About this movie	It was one of the most amazing movies that I ever saw!	10
 Wonderful	I watched this film for the fist time recently and I am in awe, it certainly lives up to praise it get's. It's rare for me to enjoy such a highly rated film as i usually set my standards to high, but you can't set your standards high enough for this masterpiece.	10
 Some birds are not meant to be caged	Okay, let's admit that it was a good movie but I don't think that it deserves to be on the top of the IMDB list because there are so many great movies,too. Still, it is good but as I've said, the position of it on this list is open to debate:(	8
 awosome	"There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent"	10
" ""Hope is a good thing"""	For perhaps twenty years this film has sat at the very top of the IMDb Top 250 films of all time. An extraordinary feat in itself as blockbusters are released year after year and several make a dash up the list. Its dominance here pegs it for many as the greatest adult film of all time. That this particular story holds this distinction is in itself a fascinating mirror for humanity in the early 21st Century. It is very different from the nearest runners up. There are big dramatic superhero films, fantasy quests, psychotic bloodbaths, gangster sagas and mind-bending psychological thrillers and here sits a story that could be a parable; An adult fairytale where a character falls from grace so many times but through integrity, hard work, endurance and on occasion sheer nerve, keeps climbing from the darkest depths. The real story however is the impact that Andy has on the narrator over the course of their twenty year friendship. Andy reaffirms Red's faith in himself and that is what I believe resonates so strongly with so many people. Andy and Red's story comforts viewers that no matter how bleak life may seem, if they dare to hope, things will get better.	10
 Awesome	"Every man, woman, and child has the word ""success"" etched into their mind. Oftentimes, failure seems like a despicable and frowned upon idea; we tend to push ourselves past the breaking point simply to ensure that we succeed. Ball's idea of ""knowing what you can not do"" is a significant topic that pesters society today. Limits exist to provide control and a sense of stability in our lives. If people are not aware of what they ""can"" and ""can not do,"" they will push their boundaries until chaos erupts. Although limits may hinder progress, Lucille Ball's belief regarding the importance of knowing ""our limitations"" is crucial to society's development because limits allow for overall prosperity and order."	8
 Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free	Fear Can Hold You Prisoner, Hope Can Set You Free Hope is a good thing, and maybe the best thing of all.	8
 some birds are born for fly	I love to watch this movie. it gives me motivtaion for never give up.	10
 90'S Is the Best for Culture	I love it, i do always love and watch to see movies on 70's to 90;. To me those was the gold time for cultured. I want to see more . Best Film.	7
 Still packs a punch	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a very emotional movie. It takes its time telling its story but it doesn't feel long. It is a great looking movie with a terrific cast. The cast all deliver top-notch performances, especially Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The last forty minutes of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" are classic. Writer/director Frank Darabont does a great job mixing violence, cruelty and humanity into a very satisfying watch."	9
 A timeless classic		9
 A message of hope	The Shawshank Redemption follows the prison sentence of a wrongly convicted man. In prison he is exposed to dispare and hopelessness. Tales of institutionalisation, people who grow up in the system adds to the mysery. However despite all the adversity he never gives up hope and he escapes. The possibility of the escape does not matter. What matters is the hope and will it represents. This is a beautiful, feel good movie.	9
 For all in 19 years.	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc.,	10
" ""A life changing movie"""	Thank god I am alive to watch this movie.I really appreciates the director of this movie.This movie is a true masterpiece.	10

 Masterpiece	An incredibly moving and touching story that will leave you with a warm and good feeling. A movie truly deserving the top spot on IMDb.	10

 Judge Lines	Many critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter-day Jesus Christ. Frank Darabont refutes all such claims, although he is delighted that so many people have read so much into his film.	10
 Shawshark	Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red	10
 Worthy of watching (and bookmarking)	Powerful message well acted and conveyed. Relevant. One of my top films!	9
 OMGGGGGG	What is salvation? Only by reigniting the hope in people's hearts can they be redeemed. Only hope is possible. Even if the environment is even worse, Andy has not given up. He continues to write letters in exchange for a better library for everyone, helping those in need to get a high school diploma so that they can be viable in society, even if they know it will anger The guards also want people to hear beautiful songs and ignite the light of hope. There is a bird that can never be closed.	9
 Hope can set you free.	This movie in my opinion is one of hollywoods greatest flicks because it stands the test of time and still finds agreement amongst its viewers. It inspires, it lifts and it delivers on all counts.(Tim Robbins) Andy and Red (Morgan Freeman) forge a resilient friendship while serving time at the Maine's Shawshank Prison. The film revolves around Andy's life in prison and his journey seeking redemption for his innocence.	10
 Love this movie	Love this movie, Before 7 years I watched this movie, suddenly I remember one scene from this movie. But I forget movie name then I searched a lot.	10
 Perfect expression of human nature	It is hard to describe what makes Shawshank Redemption so good. It is a good movie on a lot of singular areas, but the pieces are put together in a way that makes it even more. A perfect expression of human nature's good and bad, and how fragile life seems to be.	10
 Absolutely amazing. One of the great movies I've ever seen.	This movie is great. I watched it in 2020, 25 years after it was released & now I know why it's the best movie at IMDB.The story is absolutely amazing with a very nice end. It's not one of the endings where you're asking yourself what? Is that all? Do I have to figure out what's going to happen?The actors did a great job. Though the movie is very long it wasn't boring at once.Sometimes it's very sad and you feel bad for the Charakters, but very often you have to smile, not because it's funny, because it's amazing.	10
 One of the best movies ever made	Everything about this movie is flawless. No better way to describe it in my opinion.	10
 In virus times, we need this hope.		
 Stunning	There is not a single moment in this movie that makes it boring. Tears in my eyes. What a great ending. Don't know what more to say.	10
 Watch It!	Definitely one of the best films in the world. 10/10	10
 GREAT	GREAT MOVIE! A MOVIE I CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER. I DONT REALLY KNOW WHY IT IS REQUIRED TO WRITE A REVIEW.	10
 The best movie	The Shawshank Redemption(1994)the best movie of all time ever	10
 The best movie	The Shawshank Redemption(1994)The best movie of all time	10
 Masterpiece!!	One of my old time favorites!! Definitely in the top 10 for best movies	10
 Greatest movie of all time!!	"Surprising to know why this movie just had Oscar nominations but did not receive an award!! Of course, it came along with other all time greats like Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, this movie should have still swept the Oscars. This should recieve the Oscar for ""Greatest Movie of All time"". Watching this movie will keep you thinking about life and thoroughly life changing with marvellous philosophies about Hope and what it can do to a person. No surprises this is on top of the IMDB list."	10
 A masterpiece	I loved this movie and it was one of the best I have ever seen. Truly amazing.	10
 The best movie of all time!	The best movie of all time. I watched it more than 10 times. Best ever no doubt!!	10
 Best movie	Great movie, great story and script. The actors are excellent. I like and recommend it.	10
 This is the best movie ever!		10
 Really Special	I'm not one to rewatch a movie or reread a book. But I definitely want to watch this one again. I really think that says something. It's such an amazing movie, so emotional and you can't predict what's going to happen.	10
 My favorite movie!	Its my favorite of all times, highly recomend it to everyone!	10
 Freedom	The relentless pursuit of freedom is my perception of the whole film. People, as long as they exist in society, will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. There are good and bad things, but that's not what we're going to struggle with. Really should go to pinch, is that no matter how, you and I will not be the previous self.	10
 Powerful Film	A gripping and moving film based on Stephen King's novel, 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption' about the friendship between two inmates in Shawshank Prison, Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freeman). A truly great film with both Robbins and Freeman embracing their roles to bring the viewers inside the gates to experience the brutality of sadistic prison guards, rampant corruption, and dreams of the outside.	10
 Best movie ever	Best movie I've seen so far. Definitely a classic that will always persist as such.	10
 Old but gold.	Excellent performance, good script, strong story, complicated characters, and unexpected story. New-gen must see this thing.	10
 Timeless, masterpiece, emotional, insightful		10
 Well deserve first place.	This was one of the movies that you see once and that you never forget.	10
 Best Story	One of the best movie, amazing story with a great message of hope.There are not many words for this, you have to watch this marvel movie.	10
 Good but not the best movie ever.	It's certainly not better than The Godfather.The characters in this movie are likable and the story is good. The music is also quite good but anything that stands out to me. The movie is a bit slow in some places. And i find quite some bits of this movie particularly entertaining.In conclusion: a good movie and it deserves to be in the top 250 but not above The Godfather and certainly not number 1	8
 talent	The deepest feeling after the film is: talent, perseverance, is anyone in any situation to get free the best way.	10
 A truly classic	You MUST watch this movie! Don't miss out!It's one of the best movies I've ever seen	9
 Best Movie Ever	The best movie i ever watched! I had read the book when i was young but watching this movie is something totally different feel.	10
 Best movie I ever watched.	This film is the best movie I ever watched. Hope I could forget it and rewatch it from scratch.	10
 Literally the best movie	It is so good. Andy, Red, Heywood, Brooks, Jake, Warden. Nuff Said	10
 Truly one of the best movies ever made	This is the movie considered the best by critics, maintaining the spot as #1 on IMDb's Top 250 list, and it is not without reason.It is a tragic movie, showcasing an innocent man being framed for a crime he did not commit and being put in a high security prison. But instead of seeking vengeance; Andy Dufresne is instead portrayed as a more sympatheic individual, at first being the obvious punching bag for the hardcased inmates, but as time goes by (I obliviously made a reference to another great movie, but that's for another review), he gains the respect and friendship of the other characters, most notably Morgan Freeman's character Red - leading to one of the most heartwarming relationships ever seen on film.The supporting characters are all very memorable, whether its the warden and his prison guard, or the fellow inmates - every actor gives their absolute best and there are some nice sub-stories for some characters, such as James Whitmore's Brooks; giving us some of the most tragic moments seen in cinema.Overall, this movie is absolute perfection - it manages to tell a very dark and yet human and sometimes funny story of friendship and redemption, with phenomenal cinematography, music and editing.Whether it's what I personally would regard as 'the' best movie of all time is up for debate, but I truly agree with the critics in the sense that it's absolutely up there!	10
 Amazing	This film amazing for motivation and in my life influential	10
 Best film i've ever seen.	Hands down my favorite film of all time. I'd recommend to anyone that loves a good prison film - but this has a great overall message as well.	10
 View	The movie is very nice} great Job!! fantastic History!!	10
 freedom and hope	Will Andy be reshaped and changed for losing his freedom? In fact, the good and evil in people's hearts are not increased or decreased because of the loss of time and the change of environment.	10
 A very nice movie	Very good acting from Morgan Freeman.Nothing more to say than this. I'm giving it a 9!	9
 Classic Perfection	There's not much to be said about Shawshank that hasn't already been said. Morgan Freeman's acting here is some of his best, Frank Darabount's direction is near-perfect, and the story is a classic. But what really stands out is the classic feel of the movie, the sheer simplicity and perfect pacing that makes this film reminiscent of far older classics. It's not enriched in innovation but it's a worthy return to form, a perfectly-crafted masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has garnered.	10
 Comments	"The best interpretation of hopePeople in the wall always cry for freedom, but we really get the wall?The oscars were overshadowed by forrest gump in its heyday, and as time went on, the film surpassed forrest gump in the hearts of more and more people. Whenever reality makes me feel powerless, I flip out this disc and regain my strength. Without a doubt, this movie is among the top three must-see movies for men! Recall that a classic line: ""some people's wings are so bright, even the world's darkest prison, also can not long besieged him!"""	8
 Belief	It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another.	9
 couldn't be better	I have see its movie many times.so addictedA wonderful movie!	9
 The best movie for me	An integrated movie in all respects in my opinion is the best movie I have seen so far and it is difficult to abandon this opinion unless there is a shock coming	10
 What am i suppose to say?	One of the most beautiful movies i have ever seen. Words can't describe this movie, to experience this master piece just watch it. Now!	10
 Mind refreshing	Love the film. adventure experience. Life lessons are also good.	10
 SuShawshank Redemption	This movie is Awesome. The shawshank redemption. This movie is thirellaer.	7
 How many times have I watched it?	Over and over and over, it's one of the movies you never get tired of. Everytime you watch, you will see or hear something different.	10
 Prison lol	Guy does something, ends up in jail talks to morgan freeman, makes friends with people, ends up escaping wating for morgan freeman to give him his money overall 10/10	10
 GREAT	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murders of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money-laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles."	10
 Real life	What can i say. Its just awesome. Grt acting. Grt story. Its just awesome. Till date i didnt watch this sort of film in my life.	10
 The best movie ever		10
 I loved it	Best movie in the world... Most touching and satisfied climax that i ever seen... This movie filled my heart..	10
 Thought changes life	This is a movie that a man should watch. How can it be? This is a movie that men and women should watch. One day in the future, I may come to review this classic with my son or daughter. Before the film is shown, I may say that this is the most beloved film in my life, which I will share with you today.	10
 Perfect	This is a true masterpiece, the film successfully built a miniature society in prison and the way old society operates. When corrupt officials push innocent people into a sinful path, the film especially honors the strength of the protagonist's friendship and the determined determination. This is definitely a masterpiece you must watch once in a lifetime. .	10
 perseverance prevails	Persistence doesn't mean victory, but not persistence doesn't mean victory.	10
 nice movie	Allaround great movie, nice storytelling, great acting, supreme dialogue	9
 About Redemption	This is a classic about hope. The prison couldn't hold hope. The protagonist, Andy, is misunderstood, imprisoned, and relying on his heart's incomparable firmness. In the endless waiting, he used wisdom and hope to redeem life with a small hammer, and at the same time redeemed the prison, and planted the seeds of hope. To everyone's heart. So, Andy is a hero and a strong one. The relationship and friendship between Andy and Red is also very touching. Worth seeing again	10
 The innocence in friendship.	"This is one of the move which has in depth understanding which is been insulated in every scene possible.I just want to address few scenes in this film.Starting with the climax portion Andy leaving a lead to a Red to follow up and get back to him. If the previous statement is the answer then the question is in the first scene where he just leaves his wife and he affair without killing which means Andy feels that she is not even worth for his anger. So the question comes then what does he finds worthy in his life ""FRIENDSHIP"". The level of trucking scenes i the film is so brilliantly written."	9
 The spirit not to be tamed by prison	When I saw Shawshank's redemption, I realized all of this. There is absolutely no fun in life in prison. It is even more hopeless, and it is more difficult to find hope in despair. People always say not to fight against fate, but when Andy defeats fate, we can also say that this victory is just part of fate.	10
 Excellent	This movie was incredible, good story, good motivation and good act	10
 goodd	"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I sow this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them"	9
 Very motivating film	Story is very awesome and very motivating story that Hope is very good thing in life	10
 Best movie	I remember when i was i kid, my granda watch this film and i watch too. But i watched again with my family(mom,dad,youngers) month ago. It still surprisingly and heartbreaking , shocking.And very heart melt ending is safe that film ahh goddamn it ,maybe i'll watch it again with my own family again	10
 Amazing	I watched this film a few times and im never bored when im doing that.it will be still amazing film if i watch again	9
 Something touch me	I watch this movie for minimum 5-6 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc. this is my first movie review so pardon me if i did any mistake.	10
 Absolute 10!	This is by far the best movie I've seen in my life, one from few that brought teers in my eyes. Everything about this movie is eccentric, every single word is gold, sends great message in life about human behavior, different types of characters and says a lot about injustice, friendship, love, hope, courage, endurance, hate, ungratefullness etc.A must watch movie, that will teach you some great lessons in life and it will melt your heart.	10
 Unquestionable All Time Favourite	An absolute masterpiece that remains one of my top 10.	10
 Brilliant!	The story of a man who gets jail for the crime he didnt do. He is straight as an arrow but inside jail he has to become the crook to get along. He is brilliant, intelligent, humble and with hope, which is a dangerous thing. He uses his intelligence to help the officers inturn for the favor to his friends. The friendship he makes with his group. Then he finds out he can win the case but things turn turtle and you cannot imagine the surprise it pulls right before your eyes!Everything is brilliant in this movie! Treat to watch.	10

 Possibly the greatest movie ever made	Brilliant movie, brilliant story, brilliant acting	10
 A timeless classic!!!	I remember watching this as a kid and being so captivated by it. I often find myself coming back to this film and realizing that no matter the age, I can always find something new, something humbling and endearing.	9
 Hope	Hope is a good thing, and maybe the best thing of all. I love this movie.	10
 A must-see movie for a man	"Fear makes you a prisoner, hoping to set you free. -""Shawshank redemption"""	10
 Must see	Excellent must see movie about surging life behind bars battling whether it's the guards, prison mates, and/or even the warden with plenty of plot twists and narrated by one of the most well known voices, Morgan Freeman.	9
 perfect	Like when we vote, for anything, we need to follow our heart. This is a typical movie that is worth every penny, every letter... and it's a typical 90' movie! Oh.. there we have it! Between gone with the wind and now, we NEED this! Love me as I am.. says the storyline, in my head anyway.This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.	10
 Best movie of all time	I watch this movie several time and it's still amaze me.	10
 very good movie,Very nice story.	Very nice story. Good story. Have a good copy. A story that suits any age. Gives a better understanding of the prison.A story about a bank employee who pleads guilty to murdering his wife and boyfriend.He has a series of events happening.	9

This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation i	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.	9
 MUST SEE	Freeman brings the story to life in this cinematic classic!	10
 Undescribable!	One emotionally touching movie. No wonder it is on the top of the top250 in IMDb.	10
 Superb Movie with brilliant performances.	I was feeling very grateful by watching this movie.	10
 Hope and Suspense	This is one of the films that inspired me to continue pursuing film-making. The way the story is told is a wonderful combination of suspense and hope.	10
 Good movie that doesn't require a heroine	Good movie that doesn't require a heroine. Classic movies are classic because they are all doing the same thing-letting you appreciate the beauty of hope from different perspectives.	10
 Anti Ding works of hope	I find that I really want to look back at the classics recently, especially the beautiful words of freedom and hope without a female Lord, but a pedantic person now realizes that if I mentioned these two words to me a year ago, I would be contemptuous. I would feel that these two words are too empty, and now if you mentioned them to me, I would say that I love freedom and hope	10
 All time #1 best movie ever	"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the to p 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of po pular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the to p. It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a pers pective of what it is to be human and to have ho pe for the future even in the face of insurmount able adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but not hing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the ot hers. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine. And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breat hes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes sy mbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was t he short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he does n't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct at mos phere and energy that you can't help but get swe pt away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which ot her films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, des pairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel hap py to be alive. An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10."	10
 I think the best movie	I can say that it is one of the best movies I have ever watched with its script content and actors.	10
 great movie	Great movie, had a great time. fantastic in every way	
 Excellent film	Although you are able to predict what will happen, that's what makes this movie so great.	9

 GOOD MOVIE	"Twenty years for freedom and hope. ""Shawshank redemption"" spiritual level of hard core, deep meaning and influence. A man's thirst for freedom is powerful. He can make a man chisel away at a wall. The good and evil in people's hearts are not increased or decreased by the loss of time or the change of environment."	9
 No good thing ever dies	Hope is a good thing maybe the best of things.And no good thing ever dies.I didn't understand the movie before, and when I grew up, I saw it again and I cried.	9
 Worth watching over and over	This movie is a masterpiece in terms of cinematography and direction during that time. The movie provides a lot of message that is easily digestible by all level of the community.	7
 This movie is the best	You don't die without watching thisNo matter how smart you are this movie will always be one step ahead of you. It depicts how the friendships should be. The movie will not disappoint you at all.	10
 Best of the best	No matter how smart you are this movie will always be one step ahead of you. It depicts how the friendships should be. The movie will not disappoint you at all.	10
 The best movies ever	Nice movies! ilove this so much , great movies in the world	10
 A master piece	One of the best if not the best movie I ever sawn in my entire life. The movie has a strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time	9
 what can i say...	Having just re-watched this last night for the 3rd time, I remembered the entire movie within 2 mins, but as always, I was totally gripped.Timeless classic, forever one of the best movies of all time.	10
" Shawshank's redemption"" is a dream about how the caged birds fly to freedom."	Why live, there is no standard answer, because live involuntarily. However, how to live, the history of people has given a clear way to live. Andy gave us another reason to live for the truth, the good and the beautiful, just as the warden gave us a reason to live for the false and the ugly. It's really wisdom. It's the prison library built by Andy himself. It's his way of persuading the warden and the guards. Without wisdom, he can only obey his fate. Kindness is love and hatred. It's the beer and music Andy won for his inmates. It's our clap when the warden kills himself. Beauty is hope, Andy's serene and mysterious smile, his rebirth in the rain when climbing out of the stinky water pipe, and the tranquil blue of the Gulf of Mexico.	9
 Why it's a classic movie	"""It's a must-see movie for men. ""Everybody says that. But by distinguishing only from gender, the film will be narrow. ""Shawshank's Redemption"" breaks through the confines of a man's film, with an almost incredibly warm tone, and the film's greatest theme is ""Hope.""Classic movies are called classic, because they're all doing the same thing - let you appreciate the beauty of hope from a different perspective."	9
 great	It is the story of a young banker in prison for a wrong and his quest for freedom.Different people may have different feelings when watching the same movie. For the current powerless to change the status quo of me, after watching this film is the deepest feeling: talent, perseverance, is anyone in any situation to get free the best way.	9
 Perfect Film		10

 Fulfilling	This is a movie that enables you to connect to every single character and gives you the experience of a lifetime. Hats off to the cast and crew.	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	The best movie I have ever seen, every detail and every dialogue comes down to the heart, every line is classic! Knowledge alters your fate! One after another! Those close to Zhu are close to those who are black! Water can carry a boat and it can overturn!	10
 Amazing movie!!!	One of the best movies I've ever seen. I would recommend.	10
 Outstanding Movie	"Yep it is a great movie. The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	10
 WATCH THE GODFATHER INSTEAD. The most overrated film of all time		7
 review	Good movie! it's good to watch on a rainy day at a saturday night. recommended	7
 Be full of hope	"There is a sentence in Shawshank's redemption:""Don't forget,this world penetrates all high walls,it is deep in our hearts,that is hope.""There is no endless winter and no spring that cannot come."	9
 a brief evaluation	"Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it. He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent. On contrary, he found ways to kill long time to escape. He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom. He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners. All the prisoners liked him, for he helped them find hope again. Perhaps it was time to escape, in a lightening and thundering night, he escaped from the prison through the hole he had dug for twenty years . He was free eventually .I like Andy very much ,for his talent and his wisedom . And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up."	9
 LIT	I am not sure but It is so so good and you have to watch it.	8
 Great Movie ever made	Inspirational. dialogues are awesome. never lose hope. hope makes you stronger	10
 Simply the greatest movie of all time...	Direction,writing,cinematography everything about this movie is extraordinary....and what can we say about the actors...both tim robbin and morgan freeman delivered the best performances of their career...	10
 A Spectacular Example of Cinema at its Best	When I first sat down to this movie as a thirteen year old with a fascination for cinema, I did not expect to be whisked away into a film that still stands in my top ten to this day. A true masterpiece in every regard.	10
 The Go-to prison movie	A really good movie, it's very touching. I feel bad for dufresne, but i'm also happy for him because he learnt something he never would have learnt if he was a free man. I give it an A+	8
 freedom in my heart	It is really classic, everyone has a desire for different freedom in their hearts, but they have to be bound by the real life, very contradictory individuals, I hope everyone can find true freedom like Andy.I love Morgan freeman	10
 About freedom	This is a film without love and beauty, but it deeply touched my heart.Hope is good thing, and maybe the best thing of all.The hero's desire for freedom allowed him to overcome everything. When he succeeded in breaking out of prison, I cried too.	9
 Masterpiece	"Shawshank is simply one of the greatest American films ever made. ""Thick as theifs"". A tale of 2 men that become friends and endure quite gruesome hardships. Absolutely amazing film."	10
 Fantastic story	A must see for a diehard fan of a great script. While watching this movie, remember to to bring all the snaks and drinks. Not a single minut can missed. Enjoy	9
 Classic works	"""Some people's wings are so brilliant that even the darkest prison in the world can't besiege them for a long time."" this is a movie full of hope. Whenever I feel tired, seeing this movie will be full of power."	10
 greatest movie	One of the greatest movies ever. An outstanding story presented at the right pace.	10
 some people's wings are so brilliant that even the darkest prison in the world can't besiege them for a long time!	"At that year's Academy Awards ceremony, it was covered up by the soaring ""Forrest Gump"", and with the passage of time, the position of the film in more and more people's hearts has surpassed ""Forrest Gump"". Whenever the reality makes me feel so tired that I feel powerless, I can turn over this disc and regain strength. There is no doubt that this film ranks in the top three movies that men must watch! Looking back on that classic line: ""some people's wings are so brilliant that even the darkest prison in the world can't besiege them for a long time!"""	10
 good movie	Freeman's character is more compelling, giving him a natural grace and dignity. It's a really good movie	10
 Ultimate	Amazing movie. One of the best ever!! Highly recommend to everyone.	10
 very good	So far, no one's favorite movie! Plot and acting are all meant to be awesome! Insurmountable classic in the classic!	9
 never give up	"When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.Wheather the figures and details or the spirit that the music conveyed to.""Hope is dangerous"" Red had ever said,But Andy has always sticked to it.He didn't cry when he was thrown into prison though he was innocent. On contrary, he found ways to kill long time to escape. He helped the head of the prison do the illegal things in order to gain some freedom. He rebuilt a library and helped the other prisoners.

 Very nice movie	Very good screenplay, excellent performances and entertaining.	8
 Best film Ever	Watched more than 3 times and never get bored . Kind of this movies never die	10
 Hope is always a good thing	"The classics in classics are really amazing. Whether it's the plot, the meaning of the expression, the lens settings, the actors' acting skills, the music rhythm, etc. are so perfect. I was deeply impressed by the first time I saw junior high school. It's been a long time since then. ""Hope is good, maybe the best in the world, and good things never die."" I remembered the original lines in the film for a long time, and it was with me that inspired me to spend some time.I couldn't stop thinking excitedly, free people would be so excited, free people on an unknown journey. I want to cross the border successfully, I want to shake hands with my old friend, and I want the Pacific Ocean to be as blue as a dream."	10
 Let us make best self	A movie without heroine, love and special effects. A movie that many college teachers like to show to their students is also a movie that you can never get tired of watching. It tells a pure but difficult story, a redemption in exchange for freedom. It is also a kind of support of faith. This movie makes a lot of people grow up and encourages a lot of growth paths.	10
 incredible	"""Shawshank Redemption"" breaks through the limitations of men's films, and the whole film is almost full of incredible warm tone, and the greatest theme of the film is ""Hope"""	10
 If you love to watch, you love this one	This movie released 1994 but till the movie is the number one. There are significantly several reason for this. I watch the movie many times and every time I find something new. 'Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best movie if you love to watch. There are so many story in one movie. So, if you a movie lover and till not watch the movie, just watch.	10
 Great movie	After watching this film, I think good faith is important. When others don't believe him, he still doesn't give in. Still have a good yearning for life. Do what you want to be, such as the title of the film also redeem the people around him	9
 Andy Dufresne	"There are too many comments on The Shawshank Redemption, and almost everything has been said ten million times. In order to avoid repetition, I will not say words like ""hope"" or ""freedom"". Of course, these are all very good, and they can also be felt from the movie the first time.Well, let me talk about another word I have ever felt, ""rational"". Andy's victory is the victory of reason, and Andy's success is the success of reason. No matter what the situation is, whether it is good times or bad times, he remains calm, silently assessing the situation and doing what he can to achieve his goals.This is a great talent!"	10
 Be true	When I was young, my dad played this movie and I came to watch it. I had to say that it was impressive, making it digging and burying into my mind deep inside. I was shocked and I wondered what kind of man could really break himself out of prison? A spoon? Well, I don't wanna write too much about the movie itselfor any other meanings. I might say that I love Morgan Freeman's performance.	10
 an immortal inspirational classic	A long road to freedom, a deep washing of the soul.This is an immortal inspirational classic	10
 Unforgettable	This is a classic about hope. Prisons can't hold hope. The hero Andy was misunderstood, relying on the heart incomparably firm, in the endless wait, using wisdom and hope, with a small hammer to save life, but also to save the prison, and hope sown to everyone's heart.	10
 I like this film very much	When I had finished watching the movie,I was excited and wanted to watch it again.I like Andy ,for his talent and his wisedom . And the most important thing that I like is his spirit-never giving up.	9
 Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of things ,and no good thing ever dies.	Habit is really a terrible thing. Brooke spent too long in Shawshank. When he was released, he could not adapt to the outside world or even fear the outside world. Finally, he had to end his life in his house alone. But Andy is different, He has hope. Although there is little hope in Shawshank prison, Andy did it. He used a small hammer to chisel away the wall that blocked his way to the outside world bit by bit with the hope in his heart. And he insisted for such a long time. I believe no one can do it for such a long time, but he did it. The world is full of hope and possibility Let's not give up hope.	9
 Hope is a good thing	Fear can hold you prisoner,Hope can set you free.	10
 perservance		10
 Inspiring movie and persistence characteristics	I have entirely watched this movie twice. The first time was at my age of 19. I stayed up for watching it because the plot is super attractive. The second time is just now. A great movie is worth seeing again and again.	10
 Every feather of it glows with freedom	Fear makes you a prisoner, hope frees you, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best thing, and good things will never die.When someone committed suicide, I almost couldn't help crying. People live in fear is really very bad, out of harmony with the environment, fear everything around them, it feels like an invisible hand, pinching his neck at any time, if can't find an exit, mental breakdown, the rest is only despairI feel very gratified, even some lucky, Rhett was not defeated by this fear. I also want to thank Andy, who left a straw for Rhett in his life and death.The Lord loves the world. In front of the supreme Lord, everyone has original sin, and we repent to ourselves. Never give up hope, save yourself, save your soul.	10
 Like	Expectation, freedom and friendship are the common beliefs and pursuits of mankind. As long as there is full of hope and firm belief, there will always be a sea waiting for us.	10
 process is important	"""Redemption of Shawshank"" is actually a kind of redemption of self. A life that pursues oneself is not just a dream, it is only how to do it yourself. Regardless of the outcome, this process is important."	10
 crying	I like the movie very much. It's great.I would recommend this movie to my friends.	10
 Free Mind Alive	Freedom is a wonderful thing, and I cannot find an adverb that can be used to deepen its beauty. Although we have lost freedom to a certain extent, we still yearn for freedom.Freedom requires ability. Yes, we need the ability to resist discipline and the system. A strong-willpower person like Andy can give freedom not only to himself but also to others...	9
 I'm most impressed	Brooks is a heavy and sad piece in the movie. He was imprisoned for 50 years. As Red said, this long age completely institutionalized him, so when he was free again, he was at a loss. The old man stumbled out of prison for 50 years, enough to make a drastic change in the outside world. He was unfamiliar and panicked, but could no longer find his place, and eventually chose to end his life in advance.	9
 Fantastic movie.	Fantastic movie. One of the best 90s movies I've seen. Everything about this movie from plot to character development is solid. The ending wraps the story up in a meaningful and memorable way. There is a reason why this movie continues to be referenced time and time again.	10
 wow	Really good film its so interesting hahahaha	10
 FOR FREE	"The feathers of some birds are too bright and should not have been kept in cages.Perhaps the point of the story is not that Andy was finally freed from prison. Instead, he repaired the roof on the balcony and liked to watch everyone enjoy cold beer. Perhaps he would rather be detained and listen to a classical music. When people are the least free and when their personality is most disrespected, they do not abandon their firm belief that they are ""human."" This is the most precious thing."	9
 The most influential movie of my childhood	If fate is unfair to you, don't compromise, fate is in your own hands.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	"The oscars were overshadowed by forrest gump in its heyday, and as time went on, the film surpassed forrest gump in the hearts of more and more people. Whenever reality makes me feel powerless, I flip out this disc and regain my strength. Without a doubt, this movie is among the top three must-see movies for men! Recall that a classic line: ""some people's wings are so bright, even the world's darkest prison, also can not long besieged him!"""	9
 My rating made it 9.3/10 :D	One of the best movie I ever watched. Thanks to IMDB whose top 250 list kind of introduced to the movie.just watched it now Mar 15, 2020 @ 2230 hr, probably the more than 50 times now yet still get the same thrill to watch Andy escape the prison and Red meeting him in the end.	10
 Harika !	This movie is my favorite. I seen a few years ago. The film received positive reviews from critics and was nominated for many awards, despite the fact that the box office gross met the budget. Afterwards, he gained great attention on cable television, VHS, DVD and Blu-ray. 100 Years of AFI prepared by the American Film Institute ... Included in the 10th anniversary issue of the 100 Film list. It currently maintains its top position in the list with the title of the best movie of all time, by catching an average of 9.3 points out of 10 with the votes of more than 2,184,639 people.	9
 Best film ever!	John Williams and Frank Darabont made impressive production!	9
 A film of profound significance.	I think the director did a good job and the writer wrote a good script. Through the description of Andy's prison life, this film reflects the society's discrimination against prisoners at that time. As long as once in prison, the prisoners are bad in their eyes, they can't turn over a new leaf. And the irony is that a lot of the people in Andy's prison were not guilty, they were just locked up as prisoners because of the immaturity of the legal system at the time and for a variety of reasons. They were tortured in prison and treated unequally. Sadly, many prisoners in prison become numb, lose their humanity and become sad because they stay in the same place for a long time. And Andy's presence changes everything in this prison. It also tells us that, like Andy, we should learn to change our perspective and learn to survive adversity. Besides, the film implies that our legal system should be improved. If a system or a system is not mature and perfect, there will be a lot of people to take advantage of the loopholes, and eventually may cause the chaos of the whole society.	10
 classic movie	You know some birds are not meant to be caged,their feathers are just too bright.	9
 The pursuit of freedom never stops.	This is my perception of the entire film. As long as people exist in society, they will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. Of course, there are good and bad, but these are not the content we want to entangle. What really should be done is that no matter what, you and I will not be the former self.	10
 Superb movie	Amazing movie.....truly depicts the concept of determination....a must watch movie with amazing storyline and character play.....the climax of the movie is such a masterpiece......it had me like wow!!!	10
 A gift to the cinema audience...	A movie that takes Stephan King to a separate point.	10
 One of the famous films	The central idea is hope, freedom, and institutionalization. Rita Hayworth is so beautiful.	8
 Time will prove the value of classics	Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free. -- the shawshank redemption.Time will prove the value of classics, though at some point they will be misjudged and ignored.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	Finally, Norton shot himself, and finally he did not know where he was defeated.	8
 Hope and cowardice who is strongerHope and cowardice who is stronger	Free is in the sun leisurely to breathe. For us, it's like air, and you don't usually think about what it's like to lose it, but for an elite youth who has lost a loved one and is permanently locked up in prison for no reason, it's a fatal blow.	10
 Freedom	We are bound by all kinds of rules and regulations. In fact, the meaning of survival is to seek real freedom. Of course, it is also freedom under the condition of restriction. No matter at any time, you should not give up your previous commitment to yourself. Although there will be many obstacles, there will be obstacles from themselves and others. But none of this can be a reason for our retreat.	10
 Greatest	"Good movies can always be read in various ways after being watched. For example, ""Redemption of Shawshank"" contains freedom and hope, friendship and persistence, dreams and pursuits, God helpers, etc. There are so many meanings, the wide range of interpretations, and the far-reaching impact, well deserved. In addition, on Rhett's evaluation of prison life: At first we hated it, then we liked it, and in the end we found that it was inseparable from it, and it had the understanding and meaning of institutionalization and social identity in sociology.In short, no matter how to interpret, the pessimist can always find strength in this film, let the optimist go more calmly, and make the pessimist full of power. This is perhaps the deepest meaning in the film ""Redemption of Shawshank""."	9
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 I love this movie	"In the film, some people are changing and others are getting used to it. The ""Shawshank Prison"" in the film is a metaphor for a relatively closed social environment. For the old Thomas who has been in the prison for 50 years, change means destruction; but for the young and passionate Andy, change is It is a redemption. ""Redemption of Shawshank"" is actually a kind of redemption of self. Stephen King, the master of suspense, just wants to tell people in this way that the life of self-pursuit is not just a dream, it is just how to do it yourself. Regardless of the outcome, this process is important"	10
 Tribute to a free soul	"The pursuit of freedom never stops. This is my perception of the entire film. As long as people exist in society, they will inevitably encounter the impact of this environment. Of course, there are good and bad, but these are not the content we want to entangle. What really should be done is that no matter what, you and I will not be the former self.We are bound by all kinds of rules and regulations, in fact, the meaning of survival lies in the search for true freedom. Of course, it is freedom under bound conditions. At no time should you give up your previous commitments to yourself. Although there are many obstacles, there are obstacles from ourselves and others. But these cannot be the reasons for our retreat.Hope must be there, and you must have a good idea of your future. Not only to prove anything, but to tell myself: ""Everything in this is inevitable, all I have to do is spend this time calmly."" The difficulties and depressions I once had will be my most beautiful Business card."	10
 Don't give up hope.	Struggling in despair, never giving up the new hope.How many people are satisfied with the status quo, but once they get out of that environment, they really despair?	9
 wish	In sixteen years, he has never given up hope in the face of countless desperate situations.Even if that hope is likely to fail.	10
 So..	Amazing,I felt excited the whole time!My father reccomend this movie,and i watched it with him.I felt all kind of emotions,sad,happy,scared,lonely,pity,truly one of the best movies i've ever seen.	8
 The best movie I have ever seen.	This movie gives inspiration when we are facing a difficult situation. Creating our own level of justice when the whole system is against us but we are in the right track.	10
 The Yardstick by Which All Other Movies Should be Measured	An absolute masterpiece from start to finish. A perfect ten.	10
 Outstanding Movie	This movie will keep you watching! You won't want to leave the room for even a minute.	10
 Masterpiece	Thanks to everyone who contributed to a film I love so much	10

 Keep the classics off of basic cable!		9
 Beautiful movie	Quite deserving of such acclaim, the acting is superb, the storyline captivating, and the cinematography quite beautiful. The storyline itself was unexpected and I quite enjoyed watching it unfold. Tim Robbins is really incredible in that his character comes off so subtly. And let's be honest, how can any movie narrated by Morgan freeman be bad?	9
 Stories benefit from characterization	"In Shawshank's world, black and white often have to be seen upside down. In addition to telling about the power of hope, the film also reflects the goodness and ugliness of human nature, just as we can't simply describe a person with good and bad, and many times, we can't judge whether a person is really the same. This film is not only Andy's self salvation, but also tells the world that all salvation comes from the choice of the heart, whether to yearn for the light or fall into the dark, lies in your heart.The absolute protagonist is a banker, family, career, wealth, fame and seemingly perfect life before he goes to prison. However, he was tragically interrupted and sentenced to life imprisonment because of being accused of murdering his wife and his lover. Since then, Andy's life has been gloomy. I always remember that scene: on the first night Andy and other new prisoners arrived at Shawshank, the old prisoners began to bet on who would cry and who would not. At first, I was a little surprised, because I thought it was common for a criminal to go to prison as a vicious criminal, and someone would cry? To cry, it can only happen to Andy, who had a promising future but was destroyed by misjudgment. However, it's not that Andy is the only one who doesn't cry. He was just silent in the dark.Red, Andy's good friend, said that all the new inmates would cry the first night, and Andy obviously refreshed all the old inmates' ideas. After all, Andy's wisdom, Andy's actions, Andy's bravery, and in order to leave Shawshank, he spent time and patience, are admirable and regrettable. Praise him for being able to regain his confidence quickly after falling from the cloud to hell; praise him for not hesitating to fight in the face of vicious same-sex prisoners who want to invade him; praise him for not forgetting to rely on his knowledge to help all the people who can help as much as possible when planning to escape, even if only to pass the long prison life, he has also achieved the goal that most people can reach Life.It's a pity that Andy's best years ended up in a joke of fate. His favorite disciple also died. When he climbed out of the filthy drainage channel as long as five football fields, when he took away the huge ""compensation"" he deserved, and when he finally recovered from freedom, how could the past 19 years' innocent disaster be liquidated? After all, no one can get rid of fate's teasing. Andy realized his plan by hope, but not everyone has such perseverance, such wisdom, and meet reliable friends, red. Andy's misfortune lies in God's injustice, Andy's luck lies in his never giving up hope, hope is a good thing."	10
 The Best	"No words to explain,hats offand it good to here that Over 320,000 VHS copies were shipped throughout the United States, and based on its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top rented films of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by Turner Broadcasting System, and it was shown regularly on the TNT network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. It is now considered by many to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. As of 2017, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration, and naming the film as a favorite in various surveys. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant""."	9
 That's what i call a movie	Is that kind of movie which you will watch over again and you will not get bored. From the acting, story, soundtrack, DOP, everything is a masterpiece.	10
 Best movie ever in my opinion	It's been over 20 years since I watched this title for the first time and I can still watch it and enjoy it! This is a timeless piece and a must watch!The plot of the movie is, simply put, perfect! The characters and the cast were well chosen and as a consequence, their interpretations will make you feel you are watching something real.I've always enjoyed prison movies but Shawshank Redemption takes them to another level. Tim Robbins is amazing as Andy Dufresne, who beats the system with his witty mind. Morgan Freeman does not disappoint and it is the perfect companion for Mr. Robbins in this filmI cannot do any other thing other than recommend this movie to anyone who wants to have two of the best hours of their lives in front of a screen.	10
 Unusual book of Stephen King	This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.	9
 Great movie	I love this movie. I watch it at least 4 times a year.	10
 Simply the best	This film is a masterpiece. In my opinion, the best movie of all time. After years of thinking about it, I still can't put my finger on what makes it so good. All I can say is that it's relaxing, most of the time, and has a great story and message about hope.	10
 WHAT PARENTS NEED TO KNOW	"Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced sex. Guards beat and kill an inmate. A prisoner is shot and killed by a man with a rifle. There is also a scene in which a character crawls through 500 yards of a sewer pipe filled with excrement. There is also frequent profanity, including ""f"" and its variations. However, the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions and a sense of maintaining perseverance and hope in the darkest of hours."	10
 It's 2020 and I still consider this film the best I've ever watched	We're now in 2020 and I still consider this movie one of the best I have ever seen. I watch it every couple of years or so and it always amazes me. I can now say it's an excellent classic. Pretty much every review here says it all. Brilliant I'm every level.	10

 A perfect movie what more can be said	When I first watched Shawshank I thought a typical prison movie but it was much more than that. This movie got into my soul it's like the film spoke to me and not many films speak to me on this level. I really would like everyone to see this film at least once in there lifetime. You will not regret it best Stephen King adaptation ever I will always watch this movie when it comes on tv I just can't get enough of it that's why it is my all time favorite movie I give it a 10/10 for that all performances are worth watching.	10

 Best Movie Of All Time	This is rightly rated the number one film of all time. It makes you feel the entire emotional spectrum. Amazing acting, brilliant story, and a satisfying ending. There's also great messages behind the film that shows how the human spirit can ensure even the most devastating situations even you choose to hold onto hope. I highly recommend this film. You won't be disappointed.	10

 Great Movie	I would watch it over and over again. This is on e the best movies I've ever seen.	10
 Best movie i had ever watched.	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a great film to watch; some might find it stressful, because in fact it is a serious drama that shows a lot of injustice, violence, and other discouraging scenes. But, all this is needed to show how a single man with a dream and strong character can withstand all his misfortunes and change any life circumstances for the better.What I liked most of all was the actors' performances. Every person participating in the film acted so realistically that sometimes it seems you are watching a documentary."	10
 First Cinematic Thrill	I loved this movie as a kid and it spurred a lifelong obsession with movies / acting. Great movie, beautiful cinematography and choice acting.	10
 Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie	Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	NICE ONE, EXCELLENT STORY.rEALLY i LIKE IT VERY MUCH.	10
 Best best movie	One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.	10
 Just marvelous	Probably the best movie ever made.I've seen the Shawshank redemption maybe 20 times over the years and it still moves me each time. This is a timeless masterpiece where everything just comes together in to perfection -the score, the acting, the editing, the directing, the source material and adaptation. If you by some fluke should have missed this you have to allow yourself this amazing experience. This is a once in a lifetime movie where everything just comes together. With this and the green mile Frank Darabont made two of historys best pictures but this still take the first place in my book. Don't miss out on this one!	10
 One of the best movie of all time		10
 It's cool and i love it	It's cool but i have a probelm with subtitles and that I don't like	9
 good	This movie is very good and you should watch it I very much love the ending	10
 Perfect combination		10
 excellent movie	I find movies where you lose track of time are the best	10
 Movie recommendation	One of the most watchable and instructive films ever!Look at it you won't go wrong.	10
 best one ever	Best one ever we can see it over and over againand always cry at the end	10
 What a movie	The best movie I had ever seen. Just watch the full movie, dont miss the last part.	10
 Gooddddddddddd	Good	10
 Good	So good.This is one of the movies that makes me think a lot	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	One of the greatest films made in recent years. It's a story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about our life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances	9
 Just astonishing!	Ah! What a film it was. For me, it explained freedom most precisely. And yes, it will surely let you know that only a man behind the bars can explain the freedom in best way (Dufresne and Red in this movie).It just changed my views towards life.	10
 The best	This is one of the best motivational movie ever. Do give it a try.	10
 Too good to be true	Very well crafted and directed. All the scenes make sense and feel like they should be there. Runs very smoothly and easily flows from start to finish. My only problem is that near the ending with Andy escaping through the sewage pipes is actually realistically impossible. He would have died trying to get out the way he did. Otherwise, if they fixed that part, it would have been perfect.	9
 I love it	I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life.	10
 good	Very good. soooo goodVery good. soooo goodVery good. soooo good	10
 This film makes me feel Free!	This is one of The Best movie in The history, or... It is The Best movie in The history! The acting is so good and the story is beautiful, which makes a incredible combination! I am a 12 year old kid, i watched a lot of movies Which were very good, but this one is The Best! Why? Because it has a great message....This movie made me Free from The prison inside me!....There are some People with some bad rewiews.... They are not even Humans, they are monsters disguised as Humans :)))... GO ahead and watch this movie, you have nothing to lose, you Will get inspired, happy, and that great message from it and realize what the world really is ! But Also a little sad... Because of that poor old man! :( Once you watch it, you'll know Who!....	10
 redemption	Its the best movie of all ages.its perfectly show us to have hope even when there is non.	10
 The best movie ever	I can confidently say, it's the best movie that I have ever seen.The plot is great , you like to follow the olot. Actors are perfect. It has a very nice story with a great ending. Highly recommend it.	10
 Captured	This film captured a lot of real life feeling. I compare this to being held underwater fighting for air. And then finally at the end Climax coming up for oxygen. Please buy all the Dismal events in the character's life he finally gets some sort of relief by escaping	10
 Legendary	Best movieone of the greatest. best cast and best crew members. high quality movie	10
 ONE OF MY FAVORITES!!!	I've seen this moving a thousand times and still watch it every time it comes on. Love this movie!	10
 all time favorite movie of mine		10
 Incredible	Best single movie ever to exist everyone should watch it before they die	10
 Well written and directed	This is hands down one of my all time favourite movies. Full of twists and turns and intellectual sense of humour. Thoroughly enjoyed it	9
 A movie that will be misunderstood	If this script (if it could be said to be a script) had not been from Tarantino, it would have never reached theaters (and perhaps not even on cable television movies).Long, boring and pointless.	10
 A great movie about friendship	This movie is one of the greatest movies of all time and i will never get tired of it.	10
 Absolutely brilliant!	Absolutely brilliant! Well done! Good work! Amazing!	10
 Great production	One of the very first film, which opened my eyes to cinematography. Great production.	9
 Great movie	I'd say this is the movie that got me into movies. It got me into more of my favorite movies such as Taxi Driver, Inception, Pulp Fiction, and so many other great movies. Morgan Freeman has to be my favorite actor in it, not to undermine Tim Robbins whose performance was compelling and beautiful. It does a great job of humanizing criminals and it has one of my favorite antagonists in any movie ever, except maybe the Joker in the Dark Knight or Candie from Django Unchained.	10
 The best film ever	Masterpiece. No words needed. Muse see for everybody.	10
 The best series!	It's the most logical and immersive series I've ever watched.	10
 Too beautiful to criticize	"I think Morgan Freeman is the best actor in film history. The movie also deserves to be in the first place on the imdb list because it has been successfully adapted from the novel of a genius like Stephen King. Characters have come to life with amazing actors who will not make any other players think. It has all the elements that make a movie so good. There are characters that have been in our minds for years, Morgan Freeman's great narrator voice, unforgettable Brooks character, and scenes and characters that inspire many TV shows and movies. If thousands of people can watch a movie dozens of times, that movie is of course ""highly recommended""."	10
 Brilliant	My all time favourite film, it's very very close to the perfect film in my humble opinion	10
 Amazing	One of the best movies of all time. Andy Dufraine swam through a river  and came out clean on the other side.	10
 The best!	A gift from mankind to mankind. If aliens come to earth we have to make them watch this masterpiece. They might spare us!	10
 Loved it	It is one of the most beautiful and overwhelming films I've ever watched Totally worth watching.	10
 The Most Great Movie Ever	Taking out the fact that the writer is one of the best that our time could give, the genius of the interpretation of the actors and the privileged view of the director, make this movie one of the best of his time, in short I think it will be difficult to overcome, although there are more blockbuster movies than this one, it seems to me even the best I've seen.	10
 Always will be my	NO matter how much I watch. I still watch this movie just to see myself happy and crying at the same time. Morgan Freeman is the only orator who cannot be replaced in movies.	10
 good	Have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.Not everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.	7
 watch this movie	Tim Robbins as Andrew Dufrene gets in a prison called Shawshank for killing his wife and a man who was having sex with her. He says he isn't guilty. He makes friends in prison and stays in prison for about 25 years. In this time a lot happens. He builds a library for his mate, he gets raped, he does the taxes of the director and he spent about 4 months in the isolated cell. This all makes it everything but a boring movie.Now let's talk about the qualities of this movie. Firstly, the cast. The movie contains fabulous actors like Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. The acting in this movie is spot on. The fact that the acting is so good makes the storyline even better. You really feel like you are in the story yourself. The story is really thrilling and non-predictable. For example: At the end, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are having a conversation where Morgan takes away all the hope off Tim. After this conversation, Tim asks Morgan for a rope. You probably think he is going to commit suicide, but this wasn't the case. Really interesting. This makes it even more exciting to watch it without being interrupted. So here's a tip: don't check your phone while you're watching this movie.I think The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie of all time with the stunning storyline and the amazing cast.	10
 OMG	The best movie ever i watched.the best of bests.morgan freeman you are the man.	10
 Simply the Greatest Movie of All Time	Yep...this is it...an absolute masterpiece that is timeless	10
 One of the best movies ever made	Acting - bestStory - awesome and complexVideo quality - awesome considering the time beingHighly recommend it for anyone!	10
 Best prisonbreak movie ever !	All time classic and best movie considering the production, acting, costumes, and screenplay	10
 A tale of hope	What can be said that hasn't about this film to me it is the greatest film ever made its inspirational when you think it wouldnt be but each actor in this film delivers a terrific performance it really is about how even in the darkest of places you can find hope I understand sevral people have accredited this film to changing their lives for the better which is rare especially for films to have that impact on someone to give them hope when theyre suffering from depression is a testament to this films greatness and in the end thats what Andy gave red back shawshank took hope away from red but andy gave it back	10
 One of the greatest of all time.	This is clearly one of the greatest Stephen King movies actually performed to the writing masters stories. Well done.	10
 One 2 se	Se it its worth it. How to tell about a film Who you have to se 4 your self.	10
 Awesome	Superbly scripted and casted. Stands the test of time. A story based upon friendship perseverance and how one man defied the odds. Sometimes it's best not to read too much about a movie and just allow the story to sink in. You won't be disappointed is all I want to say.	10
 Wonderful Titles	Every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title Guy	10
 The Best Movie Ever	Shawshank Redemption is indeed the best movie ever seen by me. The way the cast and directors have worked for it, really give me chills every time i watch it!	10
 Amazing movie	Has everything required to be a successful movie! Great casting of the characters also pave the way to a fantastic film.	8
 Classic	This is for me the perfect Movie. I have no more to say...	10
 AMAZING	It is one of the best movies i have ever seen i enjoy every minute. i would love to watch it again this site is wonderful.	10
 Perfect movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a very meaningful movie. It makes you think while watching. It's an emotional and cross-cutting film. I was very touched. The concepts of captivity and freedom could not be better explained. The players really played by giving themselves. Thanks to everyone who contributed.	10
 Remarkable Work	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption touched my soul. I really liked the strategical thinking behind this movie. Remarkable direction and acting.	10
 Loved it!	I am just learning how to use IMDB and I am just giving a blanket response out of curiosity but that doesn't make this movie any less epic!	10
 A masterpiece!	Why did I not watch this movie sooner?! What a perfect masterpiece! This is one of the best movies I have ever watched. The setting, environment, casting, acting or in other words, everything was an absolute phenomenal.I loved the relationship of the characters and the story arc. The level it set on the emotions of the people was the reason this is one of the best films ever made. To the people who worked on this film, thank you for this wonderful film. It's a crying shame that our industry does not make such movies anymore.	10
 Very very good! Deeply impressed by this movie!	It is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Watching very impressed!	8
 the dream of me to direct such this film	The beautiful feeling that accompanied me watching this great masterpiece cannot be ignored	10
 Epic	I don't believe someone will ever make a better movie than this one.	10

 Ever green	Best movie ever i seen in my life,,,,,,,One must watch this movie in life	10
 Greatest of all !	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.	8
 Spectacular!	"Timeless film with brilliant actors!""Hope is a good thing, maybe the bet of things, and no good thing ever dies"" - the best quote of the history of mankind."	10
 Amazing!	Such a great movie. So many great characters and I love the bond between Red and Andy. Shows the trials and tribulations inmates face. And the twist towards the end is amazing. Excellent movie!	9
 The Greatest Movie Ever Made...	In my opinion, this is the perfect movie. Perfect characters that are fleshed out flawlessly. The story sounds cliche but it is done perfectly.Final Score: A+	10
 What a timeless masterpiece...	When I read Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption from Lord King I thought, WOW that story has to be brought to the Big Screen. When Frank Darabond realized his Vision I couldn't believe my eyes. It was more than perfect. Everything about this flick is pure perfection. Love it and always will...	10
 Amazing	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen it is classic of a life timeJust stunning I watched this movie over 20 timesOne thing I Don t understand is the idiots who gave 1 rating for this movie	10

I watch this movie for minimum 2-3 times first to last. so every time i enjoyed as i watching it first time. its a piece of art. and we now know how to entertain with no action or fighting scenes. its a pure drama that anyone can enjoy with family in silence. so i rate this movie 10 out of 10 because of amazing screen play, acting, casting, background scoring editing etc.	10
 Shawshank Prison	The shooting angles in Shawshank Prison are neat and simple with soothing music that helps to remind a peaceful land free from the bars. The acting of the two actors Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red brings great emotions and inspiration to the viewers. People will always be impressed by the determined coldness on Andy's eyebrows, the gentle smile and deep red eyes full of concern. Not only the two of them, but all the other characters also left an impression on the hearts of people.	10
 Outstanding	Compliments all around! Stephen King is amazing. Compliments to the cast and crew.	8
 Brooks was here	An enormous production that deserves to be at the top of the list	10
 Awesome	Great movie. This movie is awesome, it gets you captivated from start to finish.	9
 A movie that will make you flabbergast.	This movie is one of a kind, it gives an experience that can never be predicted in the beginning or in the middle and the ending is a total roller-coaster ride.	10
 Wonderful movie	It's one of the best movies I've ever seen!if you haven't seen it, you're living for no reason!	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	9
 nice film tbh	"I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame.But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title."	9
 This movies good	It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	8
 One of the best endings in all movies I have seen	This movie has great acting. It highlights a great friendship developed between two inmates and has an excellent ending that is second to none in the movies I have seen	10
 Good movie	Amazing movie definitely one too see and too see how is was in those prisons.	10
 One of the Greatest of All Time	The ultimate story of redemption - not as a judicial system defines it, but as a redemption of spirit. Really a beautiful film in every way, and one of the greatest of all time.	10

 Good movie	Good movieGood movieGood movieGood movieGood movieGood movie	10
 Perfect	This film is perfect in every sense of the word, every scene immaculately shot, every story told with emotion. This film is an art treasure. The story of redemption is a necessity for anyone going through adversity. A story so genuine and gripping, words cannot describe the emotion you feel from this film. I love you	10
 Brilliant in every aspect	Nothing more needed, brilliant on all cylinders. A story like no other that is executed to perfection	10
 Awsome Redemption		9

 Excelente movie	This movie is a once in a lifetime. Life lesson. It has everything to make you think about your life. I would definitely watch again and with some people even better. I bought this title for blu ray and it is one of my favorites with gladiator.	10
 watch this	It will change your life. Made me think of humanity differently. Each shot is like a postcard.	10
 A movie that could change your life :-)	The raw emotion, honest subject matter and unforseen plot twists make this a highly impactive film for anyone with half a heart :-)	9
 If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts	If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10	10
 You'll finish this movie feeling redeemed	Shawshank redemption is honestly one of Stephen King's best stories. Following the story of Andy Dufresne, a man charged with the murder of his wife is sent to Shawshank prison to carry out his life sentence. Andy defied any expectation of what a prisoner could or couldn't achieve and the power one could possess. With his inmate friend, Red, and his intelligence, Andy struggles to survive in prison with all his effort leading up to the grand finale.This movie is beautiful, it's brutal and emotional and it makes you question the American penitentiary system in the 1950's. But the point is that it's a heart warming story of two inmates, talking about hope, redemption and trying to figure out their next move.While there could only be one winner for the '94 Best Picture Awards, Shawshank deserved the title just as much as Forrest Gump so trust me when I say that you won't regret watching it.	10
 Buy Concerta Online	Nice and lovely ,i,m see this very time, very lovley, i,m not tell about this story	10
 Faith, Freedom and Friendship	Try to hold on some beliefs before they are lost.They may not come to pass, they may not allow us to live more meaningfully -- and even for me, they only bring me more emptiness.But I know how much I need this hypocrisy and self-deception, because you can say I'm dreaming, but I won't be the only one.	
 The best!!!!	This movie is the best from all the movies ever!!!!	10
 Hope and beauty masterfully depicted in a timeless classic for years to come		9
 for the best movie	In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.	9

 must watch film	"How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time."	10
 Shawshank redemption review	Wonderful cast. Impecable acting by morgan freeman c.Right from the begining movie picks its pace.There's no moment without thrill while watching this masterpiece.	10
 One Of My Favorites	7,095th review of this movie. Never got around to review but after some time... This film is truly beautifully filmed. With the development of each character throughout the movie you'll only grow for the love of each one of them. Very poetic movie and resolves every loose end with everything that went on. Very detailed movie that if you miss a scene you will miss a piece of the puzzle. Easily a 10/10.	10
 mükemmel	Film mükemmel, kesinlikle izlenmeli.Film mükemmel, kesinlikle izlenmeli.Film mükemmel, kesinlikle izlenmeli.	9
 Suspense and a feed good movie	This movie is one of my favorites about redemption and friendship. A must see for all.	10
 So old, but so good!	The Shawshank Redemption is incredibly long but this movie never gets old.	10
 Best movie ever	I saw this movie a while ago.Best movie ever. I enjoyed it and still remember every scenes.If you haven't watched it, you should do it right now.	9
 nice movie	"This movie is highly underrated and thought of as just another ""new guy in prison"" type of movie but, the messages of friendship make this movie one in a million. The movie chronicles Andy Dufrasne, a man wrongly convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. He meets ""Red"" a man who can get ""anything for anybody"" which is a common role in prison movies he even says, ""there must be one like me in every prison"". These unlikely friends help save each other in the end, Andy saves Red's soul, which was calloused from prison life. And Red saved Andy, teaching him all he needed to know about prison life. Although there is some lude remarks and alcohol consumption in the movie, the good definately outweighs the bad in this case. (SPOILER ALERT) If you have ever seen a prison movie ending you know the ending to The Shawshank Redemption. Both Andy and Red gain redemption in a dismal, dark prison by doing good deeds for one another. As you know, Red will escape Shawshank, Andy will escape Shawshank, but your soul will never escape The Shawshank Redemption."	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of movie that people deserve. It's a wonderful movie with a touching storyline. It grips you hard at moments and lets your mind wonder freely at the same time. You would be surprised by the lessons it teaches you and believe me, they'll change your perspective of a lot of things in life. Personally, I would have wanted it to win best picture over Forrest Gump, but that was a great movie too. Watch it, enjoy it!	10
 Brook was Here!	Best Of Best...Everyone in this film were so natural.I enjoyed every second of this movie.....Movie deals Humour,Tragedy, Hope, Friendship.#MustWatchMovie	10
 Brook was Here....!	Omg, i enjoyed every bit of this movie....How precisely they have managed.....Everyone was So Naturally Acted.	10
 unexpected ending	Didnt expect tat	9
 overrated	This is for me the most overrated movie of all time dont get me wrong its a great movie but for it to be the #1 on IMDB top 250 list is ridicoulose.	8
 One of the best Movies	Very good movie over all it keeps you interested though out the movie never gets boring	10
 Classic inspirational film	A DVD to own because you could watch it several times. Inspirational with relatable characters to root for, who wouldn't love this legendary drama with this talented cast!!	10
 Robbins and Freeman make a great team in this moving; if slightly overrated, Stephen King adaptation.	"Do I feel that the Shawshank Redemption should be on the Top 100 films of all time list? No. Do I feel it is the best King adaptation out there? No. Did I thoroughly enjoy it? Yes.Disregarding the answer to the first two questions; what we have here is a pretty watered down story about a man (Tim Robbins) who is imprisoned for the murder of his adulterous wife and her lover. While there he becomes a ""better person"" through the tutelage of a co-inmate; Morgan Freeman in a pleasantly subdued performance, who shows him the ropes of prison life. Everyone knows how the end of the film goes; but it is getting there that is the fun part, for the most part. There are scenes in the film of great fascination; scenes that may haunt you, scenes that may evoke shrill laughter, and scenes that may cause you to ponder the meaning of life. Overall viewing is worthwhile but not essential as this site and various others would lead you to believe."	8
 best film	Its really really good movie. please do watch it. the movie i have ever seen that effects me as strongly. its really impressive and good movie. please do watch everyone.	10
 Great thinking movie	I watched this movie many times. When I watched this movie first time I admire Andy that free him self from prison. Then time to time I respect the Red character. He says hope is dangerous thing. When Andy got out of hole. That was most realistic true thing to say his friend. In real life Andy Dufresne is most rare character. But Red character is common. You can find easily the person their hope and dreams.End of the movie Red is try to hope and dream for many years been forgotten.He finally feel himself as a normal person. Hoping and dreaming is very precious thing in human life.	9
 Too good	Wow, this has gotta be the best movie ever made. Beautiful	10
 That one movie that made me feel	One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.Sad thing is that films as of this levels are no longer in making ... films with meaning.Contains a strong plot, powerful performances, and the ultimate theme of good and evil, is a masterpiece.	10
 Fabulous movie	It is an awesome movie. i watched it and awesome work done by the actors and other people with great efforts.	10
 awesome	Brilliant work. It is in a sense a voyeuristic delight, allowing us to see the mafia from the inside - we become part of the family. It single-handedly change the world's view of organized crime, and created a cast of sympathetic characters, none of whom have a shred of common morality.	10
 Top !0 Films	Top 10 film. Of all the 'prison break ' scenarios this film presents a depth filled view of cunning intelligence, greed , and perseverance.	9
 Lifetime evergreen movie ⭐	Most amazing movie i have ever seenNo words to describeAmazing	10

 Amazing! Movie	One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate.	10
 Beautiful	Just, pure, beautiful.Have'nt seen a flick like this ever in my life, amd i have watched a lot of good movies, this is my first rating ever so don't be too judgy, but this movie, is just beautiful, and i am pretty goddamn speechless.	10
 Otimo	"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life......"	8
 loved it	Piece of art indeed, love it so muchthe cast is so great	8
 best adapted movie	Misery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.	10

 Legendary!	This is easily the best movie I have ever seen. It wasn't a box office smash but it came on later and has become one of those rare films that will be talked about for generations. Tim Robbins is masterful as Andy Dufresne.	10
 Really good movie.	I love this movie son much. It ages wellAnd have a great cast.	10
 Best 2 hour on my movies life . This worth every single minute	This is just fantastic how they made this type of movies.

 The Best movie	Best movieThe Shawshank Redemption and full action	10
 The Greatest Movie Ever!	As the title says, this is The Greatest Movie Ever!All actors play their parts perfect, the dialog is perfect, the plot is perfect, the endning is perfect.In short a perfect Steven King Movie.A must watch.	9
 my wilness to the stars	The great movie i ever seen , i like the story and the footage and characteres were wonderful and i take it as production of my goals	10
 The Greatest Movie I have ever seen	Shawshenk Redemption is truly on a level of its own. Fantastic plot, writing etc. The ending is probably the most baddass ending in a movie ever. What I really love about the movie is its incredibly realistic portrayal of evil and the harsher realities of life. The movie feels 5 hours long, but by the end you wish it were 10 hours. Extraordinary acting by Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton and the rest of the cast. However, I only gave it a 9 because there is always room for improvement.	9
 Real Deal	Something to watch again with my son soon! It gave a lot of lessons and it is just real for me	
 Simply the best	There's a reason this is rated the #1 . It is the same reason you simply watch this movie every time you see it on tv even if it's already half way over. It's captivating, brilliant and full of heart.	10
 Great	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	
 Get Busy Dying or Watch this Movie Over and Over!	Being a fan of prison movies, this one by far is my favorite. The research done with the way they spoke during this era and the writing itself was brilliant.The actors, what can I say.....loved them all. Tim Robbins was born for the role.The only thing I could have asked for is to have spent more time on the escape itself. I think a netflix movie should be make on the escape! lol	9
 Best movie ever	Keep yourself occupied, in order to survive. In prison life is harsh, you have to pick your companions.	10

 Arguably the best cinematic film of all time	I have watched this film a million times and it is always on cable channel. But every time I come across it, I have to pause and watch it again as if I do not know how it will end.This film is a testament to human will where hope never dies. Andy Dufresne was falsely imprisoned and forced to live a life as a murder convict. Every day in the Shawshank Prison is another day that can break the will of his unyielding humanity that could never be caged.This movies leaves me speechless and wanting to watch it again. Absolute masterpiece.	10
 Amazing Adaption Showing A Different Stephen King Story		9
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 My favorite movie	This is my all time favorite movie. I just love the portrayal of friendship, commitment, honesty, lies, intuition, there's just so many lessons learned through this movie. I live the actors that played each character!	10
 The story of a friendship.	The Shawshank Redemption is a great film, because it's a touching story about the life in a terrible jail.Andy Dufresne has been accused of the murder of his wife and her lover and has been sentenced to 20 years of jail altough he was innocent.Then begins his slow adaptation to this new and hard world.But he will meet Red, a very quiet and clevar prisoner and begins a new friendship which will help them to survive in this universe.With a lot of patience and intelligence Andy will prepare his escape.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are really extraordinary actors: they give to the film a great strength, dramatism and suspense.	9
 Amazing Film	It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other.	9
 Masterpiece	Definitely win your heart and worth watching and story acting cast editing all blow your mind away	10

 My Heart want to see this movie again and again.	I have from a youthful age been an immense devotee of anything Stephen King composes and had just perused the short story that this motion picture depends on years before observing this motion picture. I love this movie.	9
 A Masterpiece One	A extraordinary film that will blown your mind awaya whole package of awsomeness	9
 Hope is a great thing	One of the most fascinating movies Literally made my whole life meaningful Thanks Andy	10
 The most amazing film ever made.	Simply put. The most amazing film ever made...It doesn't matter how many times I've seen Shawshank, it always pulls me in to watch it, again and again. When you have a perfectly written script. The best actors. A dedicated director with a vision. Shawshank is the end result. Simply perfect.	10
 Some birds cannot be captured..	Expectation is a great thing to live life, hope should never be left even when a person has nothing left, along with this a lot is learned in this movie ...I have never seen such a movie before. The direction, story, acting of the movie is amazing.If I say a line, it tells us the secret of life.	10
 One Of The Best Stephen King Adaptations Of All Time	I really don't need really to say anything about this film,The casting is great, acting is great and has an underlying theme of hope.	8
 Beautiful Movie.	It has become a movie that everyone watches at least once. While nothing stands out, there is a great mix of prominence in every subject.	
 One of the best movies i have ever seen, really moved me.	A prison melodrama doesn't exactly sound appealing, but what Darabont does brilliantly is balance the darker moments with wonderful cathartic moments of warmth, friendship and hope. Freeman's narration has a tremendous part to play in selling these moments too. Indeed, Shawshank feels like a film that is unashamedly full of catharsis - the beer drinking on the roof ; the music played across the prison ; the final scene - and these moments provoke such a strong emotional backbone to the film, that it is little wonder it is considered one of the best films of all time. Certainly, it is probably the finest example of a film about male bonding and friendship and whilst Robbins and Freeman's characters are the focus, all the supporting characters make an indelible impression too. But ultimately it is the central touching friendship of Red and Andy and the hope they embody that makes the film so appealing. Wonderful film!	10
 Just watch it, ok?	Everything needed to be said has already been said about this movie, I have nothing to add. If you haven't seen this film, then watch it.	10
 Who is the protagonist of this movie?		9
 The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen	I have watched many movies over the years... but this one just blows my mind and brain...The voice of Morgan Freeman always wonders me and coolness of Tim Robbins just good enough to make this movie the best of history... All time best of mine!	10
 The best ...	There is always light end of the tunnel. Watch it whenever you feel disappointed.	10

 Very nice	Very Very nice I like all in this film , is very nice in my opinion but nobody cares in my opinion xd	10
 10/10	Best movie i've ever seen. Movie had good plot and it was entertaining.	10
 A classic piece of film making, HATS-OFF...	How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.	9
 One of the greatest films	"It's quite hard to even start rating this film as it is just simply ""Incredible""!The acting cast was amazing, the producer did an amazing job with the individuals he picked for each role.I watched this movie in the theatre many years ago and purchased the VHS tape as soon as it became available. Did the same when it was released on DVD and have watched it many times over. Well worth it.Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this movie. If you haven't seen it by now, stop wasting time, get it, own it and greatly enjoy it."	10
 Filler	Just a review so my profile doesn't tell me to write one.	8
 good	Its very amazing movie .. good job the shawshank redemption	8
 Classic	Hope...is a good thing good things never dies, nailed it with perfection	10
 great film	Would say it again and again. cannot get bored of it.	9
 simply put good but so so so very overrated...	Most defiantly not 1 of the best movies/...While in many ways presents things I...n A different light it's not that amazing... If you'd ask me... (without giving spoilers) the movie in general... humanizes prisoners much much more then most prison movies (a especially for the time and...)and that's why I believe it snowballed so much attention and simply caught onbut at the end of the day it's not that original it's not that good... It's fine even a good movie but not a 10 or a 9 not even a 8....it's Unbelievably over rated...you should watch it.... but after you do think before you rate go over the plot again and.... there's also a need to separate the ending from the movie it's self.... again at a closer look it's not that! amazing... good but over rated....	7
 Best Movie of the Film History	Although the film did not win many awards, it is considered by the authorities to be the best movie of the movie history.The movie directed by Frank Darabont and relased in 1994. Drama and mystery the type of the movie and Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are playing the lead roles.Andy dufrense was a succesful banker and he blamed to kill his wife.he found guilty, he got life imprisonment and went to the shawshank jail.And the events develop.I think this movie is best movie in the film history.I have watched it several times.Especially I affected the frendship and the mystery.Words are not enough to describe this film.	10
 Must See	It sure would be a shame to go though life without seeing The Shawshank Redemption. It is a classic that draws emotions from start to finish. It is a long film, but you still won't want it to end. I will be watching again soon!	10
 super overated!	Out of usa, this movie never has ranked as high!it is great movie, indeed but not a classic as the godfather, or other WORLD WIDEacclaimed!	8
 I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking 's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	10
 Good but the best?	This is not the movie on the top of Imdb's best movie list that i want to see.	8
 Fantastic film	A great movieWith brilliant games and spaceFull of hope and perseveranceI loved this movie so much and so far saw it and enjoyed every rainfall.	10
 One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope.	"He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	9
 THR's 1994 All time greatest movie		10
 Overall good	Movie is really good butI don't think, it is the no 1 top rated movie...	7
 The Best Movie I Ever Saw.	"""The Shawshenk Redemption"" is not a regular experience. It's a compeling story about two prisoners who's holding to the only thing shawshenk is trying to break for them - hope. Darabont delievered one of the cinema's finest production works, and personally for me the greatest movie ever made.He knows at which points to touch, at our most universal and deep points.And I think its length is just a plus because in its first views you feel like all its heaviness falling apart towards the end has been recharged for almost two hours.I've seen a lot of movies in my life, no one touched me at all points like him."	10
 The best movie	Why do I want to write the comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	10
 Stephen King's Prison		10
 Best Movie Of All Time	One Of The Best Ever In 20th CenturyThe Acting And Drama And Great PlotThe scene That Andy Escape From The Prison Through The Tunnel Was GreatMorgan Freeman Was Fantastic In This FilmProbably This Is The Only Film That Has No Mistakes	10
 Exciting prison drama from the King of horror	Written by Darabont on the basis of a story by Stephen King contained in the anthology Different Seasons, The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly balanced prison movie. An excellent script, a good direction, perfect scenarios (the one that in the film is the Shawshank prison in Maine, is actually a prison located in Ohio, used for filming) and a fast pace. Brilliant.	10
 AMAZING MOVIE	I like this is movie ... This is movie is amazing ...	10
 The Best Movie	There is only 1 plus in this movie, it is there is no minus.	10
 good	Its kinda overrated but its still a very good movie	8
 Perfection!	I'll watch this any time I see that it's on TV. Doesn't matter if it's 5 minutes in or halfway through. As soon as I've watched one scene I'm sucked in and will watch it right to the end.There's something mesmerising about it. The visuals, the soundtrack and voiceover combined with a great story and characters make it.I still remember the first time I saw it on an old VHS of my parents and was blown away.A must see film for everyone.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10

 What do I in fact Know about Good Film or Story...?		10
 Unexpected	Story unfolded in an unexpected way. And that was really satisfying.	9
 The best movie i have ever seen	The Shawshank Redemption is one of those perfect movies in my opinion, has it all, great story, great characters and perfomances, great scenes, many emotions, a great moral: ETERNAL HOPE, and a perfect ending. I don't know if it is the best movie of the history of cinema, but certainly one of the best.	10
 The true freedom is out there	"My Review will be in 5 Main Parts:1- The Goal (10 out of 10): The Movie Goal is ""freedom"" and it's only right image (main character point of view), The movie portrayed some image of freedom for some people ""The person who used to slavery did not afford freedom, the one that was as same as the first one when he found a goal for his life he found the true freedom and the main character of course who did not forget the meaning of being free.2- The Excitement: (10 out of 10) It found here in suffering of the main character which was touch the heart.3- The influence: (10 out of 10) The movie have portrayed alot of joy, suffering, sad, happy, ... etc situations which was truely good enough.4- The Vital (10 out of 10): Was there absolutely in every part of the movie.5- Overview (7 out of 10) As general it was very good movie *BUT* There was no need of the scene of his wife with the traitor, but what can i say: it is the dirty cinema ""Ecstasy for money"".My Rating: 47/50 == 9/10"	9
 nice	Prepare to be movedspeedreid8 February 2001I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film,'s top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	9
 Fascinating	The movie is brilliant. Acting on point. Morgan Freeman is outstanding and should have won an oscar. Tim Robbims character is one smart and patient cat. Moving. Some parts shocking. Makes you think. And corruption is ongoing. Justice.	10
 Wow	"The Academy Awards ""Best Picture"" is chosen by instant runoff voting. Instead of voting only for a single Best Picture nominee, Academy voters rank the nominees in order of preference. It is up to each voter to decide what criteria use in determining their order of preference."	10
 One of the most motivational movies of all time.	"The Shawshank Redemption is such a powerful example of how people can overcome any hardship, and it gives fantastic insight on the value of time and how its never too late to live. Encapsulated in the line ""Get busy livin, or get busy dyin."" With powerful performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is a once in a lifetime film expirience"	9
 good movie	This is a very good movie.I watched this film with my family DETECTIVE story	7
 Slow Movie But Dont Know How It Amaze me	Story about how Andy Dufrense live in jail for crime he isn't commited.Im the kind of man who usually got bored by slow pacing movie. halfway is mostly nothing really extraordinary. but after that you know how great is Andy Dufrense. this movie is entertaining at it best, the only moment that for me is extraordinary is only the escape scene.still i rated high this movie because this movie is deep and smart.	9
 Awesome	"This movie is highly underrated and thought of as just another ""new guy in prison"" type of movie but, the messages of friendship make this movie one in a million."	9
 Great movie	I've seen the film years ago, but I enjoy watching it again.	10
 Best movie	Great movie I watch over and over Great movie I watch over and over Great movie I watch over and over Great movie I watch over and over	10
 Best movie	A must watch, great all time classic seen this a thousand times over and still every time I watch it moments take me by surprise and still make you feel as emotional as the first time you watched it!	10
 Perfect film and encourage people	We may meet something which is not fair in our daily life. We will be angry or sad with these things. After seeing this movie, I can face more things peacefully. And I learned we need to insist on the thing we want to do. I like this film. I see this movie many times.	10

You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 It redeems you of your heart	If you want to know inspiration, watch this. If you want to know of a story that is thrilling and with ends you'll never expect, watch this. If you want to love a movie after watching it, watch this.Maybe overrated to be the top Imbd scorer, it is yet the one that deserved to be one of the top scorers.	10
 If you don't believe in religion at least Be free in your world	If you don't believe in religion at least Be free in your world	10
 Very good	A pretty good film this is exactly wat I've been looking for in a movie.	10
 Beautiful Movie i watched ever	Having read this I thought it was really informative. I appreciate you taking the time and energy to put this short article together. I once again find myself spending a lot of time both reading and leaving comments. But so what, it was still worthwhile!	8
 So amazing	The emotions, the plot, originality, everything tied together so well at the end - normally I criticise the way movies end, but this ending was phenomenal, not cliche at all. The brutality of the prison was well portrayed, and made me feel sorry for the characters.All the characters were believable and had depth, and none of the scenes were dramatic, but there was tension throughout the film. I'm going to stop fangirling now, but this movie is my favourite tied with the Godfather!!	10
 Best ever	The only film I gave 10 stars , i can't help watching it every-time I find it on tv, really amazing.	10
 is good	Relay good movie i think tats not the best movie ever, but its one of the best movie in the world its master peace	9
 like it....	I like the script and the way it handles the plot..	9
 Perfect	It is a masterpeace. I never saw a better movie than this one.	9
 good movies every time	Love this movie for watch bwest movies every time and good ratings	10
 MASTERPIECE	In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.	9
 It's OK.	It's fine. Not bad, the story is good, the plot is wonderful, not the best, but it is not bad.	8
 Aww	This film is so interesting and I say you YOU NEED WATCH THIS! ^-^	10
 Awww	This film is so interesting and I say you YOU NEED WATCH THIS ^-^	10
 I was there	"I was there ... I was there with Red, he walked through a warm, sunny field, against the wall by which he had a ""compass"" left by him, the closest person in the world.I looked at the TV screen and felt the smell of grass, I could smell the air in this field, I could taste the freedom. This story touches, not speculating in feelings, but makes you experience fear, pain, peace, freedom and a sense of hope."	10
 Mind soothing	Well, I had expected some suspense in this. But i was not at all disappointed for no suspense. The friendship is too pure and it actually calmed my find. Come on Tunnel had to be behind that poster. Well, No 1 for a reason	10
 Amazing movie	One of the most beautiful stores of all time. The movie is a sure deal if you want a good Friday movie. I told my colleague to watch it and we haven´t been talking about others all day.	10
 The Four-Hundred And Twentieth Person To Gush About Shawshank	Shawshank is a movie I find little to no flaws. It doesn't feel it's runtime at all, impeccably cast, narratively sound, no filler, emotional, an crowdpleaser ending, and narration that actually feels necesarry. Almost every character is fleshed out in a subtle and fitting way that doesn't take you out of the movie, and it doesn't cliche the prison workers. The film takes place over twenty years, giving it stakes and a reason for the emotional connection between characters that would be manufactutred in a week in a lesser movie. The way the prisoners interact with and think of Dufrense grows and develops in a believeable and natural way. A ten/ten emorional rollercoaser that I'll never forget.	10
 impressive movie	The way he got out is really impressive and unexpected.	10
 Absolutely flawless.	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best classic movies of all the time. No wonder it got many nominations. I think everything about this movie is pure gold starting with the story because is a movie that makes you feel all the emotions; touches the soul like no other, we go to an experience that lasts 30, 40, 50 years .. men imprisoned, physically, morally and sentimentally deprived of the most basic things, the long is cruel and central, he touches and shocks, talks to the viewer through the most felt privations of detainees, the story is very complex and keeps you interested from beginning to end. This movie is really a jewel and I strongly believe that is a candidate that can't be missed in the list of films you should definitely watch before you die.	10
 Without a doubt.....greatest movie ever	No need for comments.......it's just that good. From beginning till the end it's a true TRUE masterpiece.	10
 Trance !!!!	Movie starts with a murder and everything goes normally, the dialogues and the feel of this movie are too diplomatic and at the end its like a parabola,everything reverses .	9
 Director	The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.	10
" ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a 1994 drama directed by Frank Derabont starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the leading roles. Movies based on the novels and stories of mastermind Stephen King enjoyed massive popularity for now almost half a century, some as critically acclaimed masterpieces (""The Shining"", ""The Green Mile"") and some as mediocre but cult classic flicks (""Pet Semetary"", ""Christine""). Although they never fail to entertain it's not always easy to predict where an adaptation ranges. In this case though, it's obvious.  I mean, could 2.2 Million other cinephiles be totally wrong? I guess not. This film definitely deserves the first spot. As a bookwork who loves the original short story it's satisfying to see how well adapted it is and how true it is to its source material. It had slightly different changes, but they were all for the better. I know, in the novella Red is a red-headed Irish man, but who would dislike a story narrated by Morgan Freeman? Additionally, he and Robbins performed outstandingly and acted together so well. This film is a melancholic and simultaneously hopeful journey of a falsely convicted banker and depicts how he manages to fulfill his dream of freedom. It's wonderfully filmed by the legendary and somewhat underappreciated cinematographer Roger Deakins and he really knows how to capture the devastation and the depressing tone of the story. Each and every brilliantly written character was spectacularly portrayed by their respective actor. Unlike other prison break movies this film addresses the dramatic and philosophical aspect of a lifetime sentence: What distinguishes an inmate from a human being? Of course most people commited a crime, but is it really necessary to take them in for a whole life? This film sensitively tries to answer these questions and shows us that although everything they have done, the inmates are still human beings. It's social criticism at it's finest, extremely emotionally shown through the story of Brooks. The ones who served their whole life in prison never get the chance to rehabilitate and reintegrate into society. It's simply devastating to see at times, sometimes the brutality shows itself by violence and sometimes by unexplainable human behaviour. Despite all those prominent aspects this film also depicts the hopes and dreams of a man and inspiringly tells us that it's never to late to dream and that we as humans should never give up. All in all, this cinematic masterpiece lives up to its reputation and gives us an unforgettable experience that gives you goosebumps by its packing narrative and outstanding performances. This one of the best dramas ever made and will always be a milestone achievement in the history of cinema. Brilliant!"	10
 A classical movie	I have watch this movie many time and it is great. So I will definitely recommend it to all people	10
 Best movie ever	There is not much more to write. It's a fantastic movie, please watch!	10
 very good	It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save anotherHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever diesI find I'm so excited. I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hopeFear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you freePrison life consists of routine, and then more routineThese walls are kind of funny like that. First you hate them, then you get used to them. Enough time passed, get so you depend on them. That's institution alizedI guess it comes down to a simple choice: get busy living or get busy dyingI have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock hem up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend	9
 Greatest Movie of All Time	Poetic Art .....be a long time before we see a movie of this caliber.	10
 best	Hard to pick a better movie. had me from the start.	10
 A masterpiece!	This is literally so good i wish i never watched it so i could watch it again I really love it, every scene is well done and the ending was something else!! Idk why but i cried like a baby i give it a 102920192/10	10
 If you are in a dark place ...	"And searching for the light at the end of the tunnel, then watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"", you will be doing yourself a favour.That's it, I'm not going to talk about how good the movie is, as it has all been said before."	10
 Great	THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION at Metropolitan Ensemble Theatre At The Warwick Theatre. Nice Little review for our premier in Kansas of our stage adaptation. standing ovation every night so far I hear	8
 Story, Acting level and the direction put it on 1st	No doubt about it's position on 1st.I am a commerce student and i can related how smartly he played with money and tax. amazingly executed script.	10
 perfect acting movie	After long time i will watch this kinds of movie..but sometimes movie is boring and not..so funny..funny but so so..Regardshappyrealization	7
 Javabetsport.com	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 Well... It's a really good one!	Everything is said, just gonna say it's a freaking good movie.	9
 the shawshank redemption	Very good love this app and movies that are available to watch for free	
 inspiring for everone	"When I SAW The Shawshank Redemption I had bad moment in my life because I failed in my university,my girlfriend left me so I want to suicide my self but this movie change my life.I ""HOPE"" again because found a reason in my life.I learned we should not disappointed we must try we must fight for everything even in the most terrible situation."	8
 The best	I'm really happy to see that this film is still on the very top of the ranks all these years, and rightfully so, I'm glad that most of us agree to it. Amongst many films, Shawshank Redemption touches our souls in the most humane way. A film of art indeed, but it serves its purpose to the fullest extent. It is a movie that touches the souls of real lives. It makes us feel human.The messages in this film are worth consideration, whilst the ending is one of most beautiful ones in cinema history. But enough has been said already, and I'd repeat most of them. As a conclusion, I'm proud to have watched this film. And it won't be the last. Rejoice for Shawshank Redemption.	10
 An major classic.	Will forever be known for an amazing piece of work.	10
 Precious	I love this movie. I've seen it 30 times and I like it a little more every day.	10

 The Number One	This isn't simply a film, it is a work of art, beautifully crafted, that you learn to appreciate even more after looking under the surface.	10
 An Absolute Masterpiece In Cinema	I'm sure in the 6,825 reviews there are currently for The Shawshank Redemption, anything that I was planning on saying would have already been said and more eloquently than I would.If you haven't seen this film, just watch it and thank everybody later. It has a rating of 9+ for a reason.	10
 A Prime Example of a Great Film		10
 A masterpiece for all	A movie that feels like a book, every time you rewatch you learn something, you feel something, every time is a pleasure. I carried this movie throughout my whole life, from teenager to adult years and I pretty sure I'll be watching in my late years. This is a timeless masterpiece and I hope you watch it. See for yourself.	10
 A perfect movie	If I get to choose one movie that will remain in this universe forever, it will be The Shawshank Redemption. It has all the right ingredients that makes it enduring and timeless. The screenplay is flawless and the casting, perfect. I thank Stephen King for writing the book and Frank Darabont for making the movie.	10
 Hope is a good thing	This is that kind of film that every one will love. I have watched this film 5 times and will watch it again. This film gives you hope when you are lost. Nothing short of a masterpiece.	10

 True Classic	This is one of those movies every man should see before they die. I love this movie. The acting, the direction, etc. But the ending is one of the most vindicating and the most satisfying I've ever seen. Pure excellence.	9
 Best movie I have ever seen	There are some movies that go through the brain for a lifetime. You can't remove it if you want. The shawshank Redemption movie will enter your mind.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is the main character in the story. Who is a banker The secret of Andy Dufresne's lover is in the relationship. One night, who killed his lover and his lover's lover, and all the blame fell on Andy Dufresne. Aladat sentenced him to life in prison. This is where the story begins. The picture shows how his life was spent in jail after that.The story has been told so beautifully, I was just fascinated. One of the Best Screenplay Just fascinated with such a beautiful dialogue.If you have not seen the movie The Shawshank Redemption is full of drama and mystery. You won't get another movie like this.	9

 The Shawshank Enigma.	The most confounding film ever made. Much of it is generic prison fare which we've all seen dozens of times before but is able to rise above most other films due to some genuinely inspired scenes powerful enough to melt the hardest of hearts.	10

 The best one so far!		9
 Best Film Ever Made	I'm not exaggerating it when I say this is the most amazing thing I have ever been exposed to. The Shawshank Redemption is a moving, deeply emotional drama faithfully adapted from the equally brilliant novella by Stephen King. It would probably take all my strength to not punch someone in the face for saying anything against this film.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	Great movie from beginning to the end, very well thought out and an amazing cast, have watched several times and will watch it again I'm sure	10
 wonderfull	Very amazing..one of the most amazing movies I've ever seen	10

 Great Movie Period. One of my favourite movies.	Nothing else to say, just well done. Amazing cast of actors	10
 A classic	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red."	10
 The best movie ever	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 Good movie	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods."	8
 Flawless	A1 storyline.A1 scripting.A1 casting.A1 directing.A1 cinematographyA1 costume.A1 locations.How can you beat this?	10
 nice movie	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	10

 Get busy living or get busy dying	For me this is one of my best movie of all timewhat is interesting about this movie is how the events are more and more intense and exciting to reach an end that is blowing and satisfying.this movie has a well written story and it is full of lessons that can change how you see life it also has many quotes that will stick in your brain and make you think about them very long and sometimes compare your view to life to those of the characters in the movie.the acting is of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just amazing.	10

 HOT	Amazing Film! I thought the film told a realistic story while also adding great acting thought out the film.	9
 Hello	Really nice headtitle, movie is great i will watch it 100 times	10
 My Personal Favorite movie!	"While it may not be what I consider the best movie of all time (Pulp Fiction and Apocalypse Now) Critically, It is my personal favorite movie at the time of writing this review. To start I would just like to say that Stephen King has some of the best book-to-screen adaptations of any author, several titles come to mind such as ""The Shining"" (although Kubrick used creative freedom and not ripping straight from the book), ""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"", And ""The Green Mile"".First I want to say that this is all personal preference and not to take anything I say too seriously.Narrative: The movie is not clear cut from the book and so some things are added (in my opinion for the better) to the movie. The movie has several messages that can apply to real life about perseverance (""Get busy living, or get busy dying""). never have I observed a plot hole of any sort in the 20+ times viewing. The progression of the plot is also steller. and the ending is one of my personal favorite aspects.Characters: I think every character serves its purpose well either as a protagonist and antagonist. all show real emotion from their actors.Emotion: This movie has a great range of emotions that you will still experience after several viewings. Still makes me tear up when Brookes commits suicide and the last shot of the film.Cinematography: I'm no expert in this subject but from what I see , each shot shows professionalism and beauty.Music: The score to this film is always pleasure listening to it during those emotional scenes to add to it.Overall this is an amazing film for anyone to watch, I think in fact I will watch it now...This is my first official review of any film, Thank you for bearing with me!"	10
 Excellent movie	One of the greatest movies of all time. Direction and acting is superb.	10
 One word to describe it	A masterpiece , full of hope . inspiring and not like any other prison movie !i watched it when I was 19 , my english was not good , so I watched it again yesterday I'm 23 now and I'm so happy that I gave myself another chance to watch it .	10
 Loved it	One of the most well rounded story telling and well executed.	9
 One of the best movie ever	"Hope, endurance, and unconditional friendship are core themes of the film. Corruption, manipulation, and betrayal are also present, but they're shown to fail in the end. The problem of ""institutionalization"" is shown and discussed -- a prison inmate has spent so much time in prison, he has forgotten how to live outside the prison walls. Integrity and perseverance are major themes."	9
 Forgot how incredibly good this movie is		10
 The Best Movie	The BEST movie ever made.	10
 One of the BEST movies ever made....	I too, will not go into the plot details, etc. We actually visited the Ohio Reformatory in Mansfield Ohio today, where it was filmed - it's the 25th Anniversary and it was well worth the trip and tour. After we returned home, we viewed the movie (just finished it), and having been there, it gives new depth to the film. If you ever get the chance to visit the Shawshank Trail, or just tour the Reformatory, do it.	10
 Perfect	Lost count of the number of times I've seen this film and how many people I've talked with about this film. Legendary movie and will stay in the top 5 of the greatest films ever made for a very long time.	10
 Great Movie	Very very good! Go See this movie now because it is so good!	10
 MASTERPIECE	MASTERPIECE

 Best movie	One of the best films ever, It really deserve to be in this rating, made me think more about the art of storytelling in movies.	10
 Best Ever	The Greatest Movie ever made by human beings. Don't know about Aliens though	10

 There is a reason it's number one!	Perfect performances from Freeman and Robbins! Great use of a real prison in Mansfield Ohio, The Ohio State Reformatory.	10
 flick	I have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.	10
 Riveting, Through Provoking, Moving	This is a must see title for anyone. Amazing in every way!	9
 The best movie I've ever seen	I like this movie.It has a great-deep message about life,freedom and friendship.	10
 Damn super	#TheShawshankRedemptionOne of the Best movie from 90'sWhat a movie a well written movie. This movie showcases the friendship b/w two prisoners hopes,dreams. Not for a sec it makes you bore. 1 of the best movie ever I watched of 90's.	9
 How to do everything right in a film.	If somebody was to ask me what a truly phenomenal film was, this might just be the example I would give. Everything in this film is literally perfect and I don't think I need to justify that point. Just read almost any other review of this film and you will understand. There isn't really anything else to say, as it's all been said over and over, yet I still must emphasize how perfect this film is because it really does deserve it's endless praise. It's a film I would recommend to anyone and everyone so just watch it if you haven't already, I can honestly say you will not regret it. One of the best films ever!	10
 Before Watching: The Shawshank Redemption (1994)		9
 Best movie ever!!!	Its a movie about hopeAndy is an innocent man who was sent to Shawshank for the murder of his own wife. He had hope that he will get justice but the only thing he gets was time enough to break though the prison. He spent 19 years in the Shawshank prison but he never lost his hope.While Red is a man who was sent to Shawshank prison when he was a kid and he had no hope for his life outside of Shawshank. He thinks that Shawshank is his life and he will spend his rest of life in the prison but after he meets Andy his point of view changes.	10
 If You Havent Seen It, Check It Out!	Great movie and absolute must see! One of Morgan Freeman's best performances and an all around amazing production. Cast and direction all on point. This, like the green mile, began as a simple short story and was made in to an epic film. Takes a man wrongly convicted of a crime and tells an epic story of his struggle to survive in prison after a life sentence. If you like Stephen king, you might have mixed feelings about this one. For fans of his usual supernatural horror stories...this is far and away from that type of storyline. However, if you like a movie with great story and plot twists that rival that of The Usual Suspects, then buckle up and watch this one! You really can't go wrong here.	10
 The Best Movie Ever	In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.	10
 Good Job	It's definitely one of the top five movies I've ever seen.	9
 Marvelous	This is undoubtedly the best movie i have ever seen..i will never be tired of watching this movie over and over again. the story, the acting of the actors everything is just toooooooooooooooo good.	10
 Good and exciting movie	Good and exciting movie.Acting on top.Pretty good shot for 1994	8
 love it	Ts amazing good keep it up and touch the sky and thats your great and biggest disteny	10
 So good	I give it a single thumb, I would give it two but my second one is currently putting the HD dvd back into my Xbox 360	10
 This movie tops them all	Alot of people say that there is nothing wrong with sitting down and enjoying a movie. But there comes a movie that ticks all the boxes and more something that is almost impossible and should be.Every actor does his character like a champion I could see every person become a real life person never happens.	10

 So Amazing	I use to watch video and with this video i watch today i will let all my friends watch it more and more, I love the video and i will keep watching your video always.	10
 Belongs on Mt. Rushmore of Cinema	"This film is about an ""innocent"" man who goes to prison for the murder of his wife. In prison he makes friend with an inmate and their friendship develops over several decades. He learns how to survive. Endures long hardships. And accepts responsibility. There is an incredible reversal in the final half hour of this movie, and I remember when I watched this in the theater - I have never ever seen a crowd in a theater cheer louder in my life. This is one of those movies you can watch a million times and it never gets old."	10
 Patience is a virtue	Awe-inspirting story, wonderful performances. Simply astonishing.Persistence, patience, hope, tolerance and creativity, if well combined can really set you free.	10
 A classic.	We already know that this movie is amazing. What can we say more. The people who hasnt watched it yet. Hurry up and watch.	9
 Master class movie	One of my favorite movie of all time it's a amazing that characters are well placed and put up there 100% in acting...must watch...	10

 One of the best	Simply stunning picture and a cant miss for any movie buff. Such a good story.	10
 Great Movie Great Acting Fun Story	This is really 1 of the best prison movies of all time if not the best. Plus the acting is fantastic. A must watch if you have not seen it before.	10
 believer	"FROM THIS FILM WHAT I UNDERSTAND "" IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO START A NEW LIFE""JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF................."	10
 Better than expected	I just wonder now, why I still didnt try to watch it, considering I was in love with Stephen's stories in my childhood.The episode looks really realistic and profound, like I love. The characters are deep, not two-dimensioned, like it is always now.In one moment of the movie(Andy led some talks about setting free from the prison with Morgan) I was wondering If Freeman was expressing his real emotions, because it really looked like that.So. I recommend it to everyone without any doubt! enjoy the watching and amazing play!	10
 Good	Very goodhejdhshjsdfhjjsdijsikjikdasfkdgskoasdkogjdfsijasdorgg	
 For my Father ...	This is my Dads favorite movie of all time. We have watched many movies together and this was one.	10
 great movie!	Great movie! I could watch it so many times.My favorite part is the beginning middle and end	10
 THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD	I WILL KEEP THIS SHORT.... If you haven't seen this movie you have wasted your life. Watch this movie as it will change the way you look at life. I have made it a priority to watch this movie at least once every year.	10
 Masarclass!!	Every story has its own flow. Shawshank reminds how to be calm in hurdle situation. I only loved the film because of its story telling.	9
 Finally watched this film!	I was finally able to watch this film, let me tell you it is an amazing cinamatic masterpiece. Recommend this film!	10
 Music	"The score was composed by Thomas Newman and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score in 1994, which was his first Oscar nomination. The score consists largely of faint piano music, and tremolo strings during more active or humorous moments in the film. The score's two main themes only appear two to three times. The prison theme, first heard in the beginning, is a four-note ascending line in the bass, which is developed and reaches its climax when Andy is standing in the river in the rain. The second theme represents freedom, and is first heard when the inmates are sharing beer, feeling like 'free men'. This theme does not reoccur until the final credits, and is then grander, with fuller orchestration. Zimmer himself has credited the score as the one ""that has influenced everything the most"", and stated that Newman expanded the harmonic palette of film score"	5
 Awesome	Best movie... I cried at the end...Watching in 2019 still AWSOME...Masterpiece	10
 awesome	Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red.	8
 Exceeded my expectations past where I can describe	I was told for years that this was a great movie. I always had thoughts about watching it. But then I saw Green Mile. I always credited them in the same category before watching them. Green Mile was okay and all, but it did not exceed my expectations. I did not have high hopes for this movie. Then I saw it.I was enthralled from the minute that Andy unwrapped the gun in his car. But then again, thats just me. The real action begins the minute Andy steps off the bus. The minute Hadley picks his first victim. And then it picks up the minute Andy gets his friends a couple beers each.This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I can see why it ranks number one over all. The revenge scene near the end is awesome. Never mess with Andy Dufrense. Watch this movie any way you can.	10
 I'm in love with this masterpiece	When I watched this movie for the first time I didn't know that It's the best movie ever. when I finished it I clapped my hand for this masterpiece and I re-watch it at the same day . Each time I re-watch it I find details that I wasn't notice.I am in love with Morgan freeman voice, it takes you deep inside the movie, it touch your feeling, and you will never forget his tone. He has a gifted throat.The bad point of this movie that you won't be able to like any other movie after shawshank, you can't find any movie inspire you like it.	10
 YEAH	This serie is the best serie for me.. i love any series with action and intelligence	10
 One of the best movies ever seen	How to describe a movie like this - other than simply amazing? Always recommends this one to people who haven't seen it yet!	9
 Wonderful	Truly amazing movie. Great story, great acting. The whole package.	10
 Greatest movie of all time	Incredible story. Incredible message. Incredible acting. Incredible score. This movie encompasses everything that makes movies great. You won't finish this movie without feeling every emotion possible.	10
 A classic that holds a great story, and holds great characters.	Such a classic. Even though they are in prison and cant do much, they give a lot of good advice in life and its very enjoyable to say the least to watch their characters.The movie is a roller coaster ride of good feelings and bad.	9
 its a good movie	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	10
 Amazing film ,great story.	Amazing film.It is a poiganant story about hope and friend .How friend looks like and what hope will let you to do.Belive me you will see this film more than one and each time you will say amazing,grest film.	9
 An unforgettable movie...	I've seen this movie many times, and I think it's my favorite film of all time. Great, great, great movie. I love this movie! If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend you see this movie!	10
 Hope	This film expresses from the theme level, let the audience deeply realize what hope is and what hope is important to a person! The beginning of the film is very suspenseful and characteristic. Until the film sees the middle section, the audience really understands that the protagonist is not the murderer who killed his wife.	9
 Absolutely amazing	Absolutely forever changed my life due to this movie. It is a movie of hope redemption and deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.	10
 good thiller movie	This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.	9
 Good film with a twist at the end	One of the best film I have ever seen. The plot was decent and narration drives you into it's world but finally delivers an unexpected thrill to viewers	10
 The ultimate prison break	When you look back at the year 1994,it gave us three gem movies- Forrest Gump,Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. But till movie is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have played it to perfection. The slow prison life with the usual routine is depicted in a very realistic manner. The way the plot builds is unexpected . This movies takes a sudden turn in the last 30 minutes when the world turns upside down for most. A great movie and highly recommended for everyone.	10
 BEST MOVIE EVER	Best movie in the world, Everyone should see atleast once in their lifetimebest screenplay , best direction, best acting.Must Watch	10

 Amazing film	Honestly when I saw this movie in high school it changed my perspective	10
 great, not the best	This is the most upvoted movie by the imdb community an a few other polls. it is a masterpiece and a must watch nothing less. i see people saying it is the best movie of all time. well it is not. to major motion picture organizations and critics it is not even the best of 1994.	8
 My favourite movie of all the time	Watched this movie for a first time with my father when I was a little kid. Since then I can watch this one every time when I have a chance to do so.About honour, friendship, determination, rules.Just love it!	10

 The best of best	Am not a person to review this movieAs per my knowledge this is one of the best movies which i have watched in my lifeA good study material for a filmmaker	10
 Unmissable	The Shawshank Redemption is a classic though-and-though. Stellar performances from it's protagonists in a bleak yet hopeful setting helps the viewer to really tune-in to the humanity of the film. At the core, this film is about freedom from strife in a strife-stricken situation. Watching this film is enough to cure anyone of the blues. Highly recommended.	9
 Best movie ever seen	Best movie ever seen Best movie ever seen Best movie ever seen	10
 Hope! And Hope!	It's fair to say that it's worth visiting several times; every time you repeat this film, you will see new concepts in front of you. This movie is full of existential concepts. At the same time, you can be free! Hope is the most important message of this film.	9
 One of the from all time !	Why everyone need to whatch this movie ? Cause its amazing!	10
 MASTERPIECE	Like never before seen, such a gripping and intelligent film with great acting.	10
 The greatest movie in history	Andy, being accused of murdering his wife, gets a lifetime imprisonment in the world's most heavily guarded prison, The Shawshank Jail. During his time in prison, we get to see Andy's fascinating prison story alongside with his best friend Red.	10
 Beautiful	Finally understand why it's such a highly acclaimed movie. Don't bother renting it. Just buy it so you can watch it over and over again throughout your years	10
 Outstanding Movie	This is such an amazing movie I have ever seen.The director and all other crew knows how to integrate audience with story.	8
 best movie ever	there are places in the world that arent made out of stone. there is something inside; they cant touch. it is yours. hope.. (tim robbins)but hope is a dangerous thing. hope can drive you insane.(morgan freeman)	10
 One of the Best!	One of the best movies that I've ever seen! I can't forget the first time I've seen.. I think I seen it like 3 times since I first saw it back in the days..	10
 Satisfaction	Probably the only film a blind man can enjoy, Morgan freeman's lines should be made into and audio book. People hate narrators in films which yes can get annoying but this is one of those examples that work, that's all I have to say.	9
 Perfect movie!	The mood, characters, score, setting, suspense, drama and humor are blended into a perfect movie experience. I could watch this movie over and over again.	10
 Amazing	Ten outta ten. Couldn't create a better movie if you tried.	10
 Best movie ever	It is the best movie ever. I have no words. It has a wonderfull story. Watched it, I think more than fiveteen times, never get sick of it. Just a beautifull movie.	10
 Life changing movie	This movie gives me a great motivation.First of all i want to thank frank darabont to direct this legendary movie.Each cinebuff should watch this movie.	10
 Shawshank's redemption is unforgettable	This is a classic film with a strong sense of generation, far-reaching significance and unforgettable. Whenever I feel confused about life, I always think of this film. When I am confused and confused, I always see the film's hero crossing the sewer on a stormy night. Yes, maybe that's the invisible influence of the film; although the film has penetrating lenses on some ratings, it has not the slightest meaning expressed by the film. A movie about prison and embarrassment also has a good ending like many high-score movies. At the end of the film, the friends the hero met in prison were released on parole to fulfill his agreement with the hero, and they found an iron box. Finally, they met again on the blue Pacific coast. Although the ending was good, they also had a vengeful vent. Yeah, thanks for meeting it. It's unforgettable!	10
 Best movie i have seen	No comments, best movie. Good actors plays, plot so intersting, hmmmm	10
 A romance for the best movie in the world	So what about this great surprise? This film is a true masterpiece of cinematic history. This great feat will teach you life and what's better than this !!! By seeing this unique film, you will understand the meaning of life, and this film will take you to a world beyond the boundaries of movies and cinema...i love this movie and i am sure you will love this movie too..thank make my dream	10
 Movie for one who seeks great moral in real life.	"If you born, you must watch it.Great Story.Great Actors.The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty.this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Superb Acting.adding to this Screenplay and Dialogues are Extraordinary."	10
 If this movie is playing you will stop to watch it	I don't care what part it is on or if it just stopped playing and restarted, once this movie is playing it is impossible to not sit down and watch it. It's not my favorite movie of all time but it sure is the most watchable movie of all time. If there was a channel that played this movie non stop 24/7 and didn't run credits the human race would be doomed. It would steadily collect the entire populace and without a way to escape its beautiful clutches we would perish. Borderline flawless in execution. If it was based on a space station it would be my favorite movie, but then it wouldn't be what it is. Perfect.	10
 Best Movie I've ever seen	Life, Death, Friendship, Brotherhood, Love, Extortion, Justice .. I don't know what to say, this movie was a Masterpiece! No words needed to describe the greatness of the plot, the directing and the characters, everything was perfect, I'm grateful i had the chance to watch The Shawshank Redemption!	10
 Nice feeling 10/10.........	Best directionBest performanceBest cameraBest musicBest castOverall best story and script 😍😍😍😍😍😍	10
 Awesome!	I really like this Awesome Movie! I really like this Awesome Movie! I really like this Awesome Movie!	10
 Best movie i have ever seen.	The Shawshank Redemption is a really good movie if you into crime.	10
 The best movie i have ever seen!! They just don't make movies like this anymore!!	One of the finest films that ever graced a movie screen, it's that damn good! Tim Robbins is at his finest work as Andy Dufresne a very determined and emotional character with some memorable quotes that you will never forget along with the legendary voice of the famous Morgan Freeman narrating the whole film. Every scene was crafted with heart felt emotions and full of happiness it's just so remarkable and well directed and it puts the viewer in a sad emotional yet feel good state all at the same time entire film. They just don't make masterpieces like this anymore!	10
 my godmother	I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.	9
 A film that you want to watch again and again.	This is a legendary film. But each new time you look like the first. Everything is excellent here, starting with the play of actors and ending with music. If you have depression, then you need to watch this movie. He washes away all the bad.	10
 The story	This movie deserves to be spotted n1 The acting it has the actors the drama the story every minute is enjoyable in this movie i like it but not my favourite.	10
 Amazing movie	Very well directed movie, fantastic cas group :-). I am still looking to find a movie that has the same level as this one (Drama).	10
 Shawshank Redemption	This film is thought-provoking and encouraging. I think, every people must watch this movie...	9
 Be prepared to be moved!	The Shawshank Redemption doesn't deserve 10.. it goes beyond all ratings.. such movies come once in a lifetime.. and I can say, undoubtedly, that this is the best movie I've watched so far .. across all languages!! Makes u go deep down into ur soul.. makes u realize the true meaning of freedom.. makes u realize the importance of being hopeful!! It's 2019 and I'm definitely late in watching this movie.. but better late than never!! Truly beautiful..	10
 amazing movie so farrr,,,	The best movie i had ever seen. the story , direction every thing is just amazing	10
 Forever watchable	I can't help but watch and love the Shawshank Redemption EVERY time it appears whilst channel hopping, how the hell was this not a box office success? Just goes to show, box office isn't everything. This is movie perfection.	10

 Amazing Movie and under rated in Box office at the time	If you have seen this movie you will go and rewatch it again if you haven't you missed a lot	10
 best movie for good	Too many points, too many feelings. It is the best movie for good, however times passes and things changes	10
 Must watch movie	Movie holds you till end.... The performances are good	10
 Hope springs eternal	An outstanding prison film, it seems almost pointless to write another glowing review of a film which has amassed a 9.3 average rating on this site. What I will say is that Morgan Freeman's voice over narration as Red is arguably the simplest and most effective I have heard in any film. It adds another dimension to the on-screen action. In fact, Darabont's screenplay, which should have won the Oscar, is perfectly executed, with its strong dialogue, finely wrought characters and balanced structure. The whole film moves along beautifully, with hardly any weaknesses of note. Already a classic, this film will surely stand the test of time as one of the greats.	
 'The Shawshank Redemption'		9

 Amazing	Such an amazing film,recommend to watch! I watched it with my family and it was the best thing I ever watched in my life, I found it so interesting but cool at the same time	9
 Inside and out, a beautifully sculpted movie with great life lessons.	"I think that I am a little late to the party on this one. This movie has rightfully been acclaimed as a cinematic masterpiece for quite some time now. The naked viewers eye may not have caught everything that this sentimental film has to offer.On the upper level of film analysis, we find the film very appealing to our physical senses. The basis of every great film is great writing. The film's dialogue rarely came out as cheesy, yet still carried an impactful punch. The conversations between characters always felt ernest. I found it easy to share the characters sentiments. Being someone who has worked in lock down systems such as prison, I can testify that the dialogue and writing was spot on. Something that should definitely be appreciated. 9.5/10 for writing.Still on the upper level of film analysis, the cinematography was amazingly put to use. I have never liked it when strong color tints, over done close ups and wide outs, or crazy angles are used in film. Shawshank Redemption avoids the overuse of anything too drastic with its filming style. Perhaps a smidgen overuse of the slow-paced close up technique; however, for the most part this technique really works for the films dialogue. Most conversations in the movie tend to boil down to a simple thesis put at the end of the scene. It only makes sense that the cinematography matches the flow of conversation, by narrowing in to what the audience should specifically take away. 9.9/10 for cinematographySet design is another component which was important to this particular story. It was important that there was a transition of color and feeling between each location in the film. This film truly puts the audience in locations of freedom and entrapment. 10/10Editing and directing was spot on. The film felt well paced.Now, for the lower level of film analysis (the deeper meaning). This film is a field of gold when it comes symbolism and life lessons if you ask me. This film is not only about redemption, hope, judgment, trial, captivity or freedom; it is also about the world we are uncontrollably born into. The film is sprinkled with symbolism towards birth into situations beyond our control.The film is also a symbol of the life of Christ-- Andy being that sort symbol. For example, he is a sinless man put into suffering conditions for a crime someone committed. He is depicted as soft spoken and humble lamb who is led to slaughter. He creates his first service to his fellow inmates by supplying alcohol, a parallel to how Christ began his earthy ministry, turning water into wine at a wedding. He teaches others, he helps those who are his enemies, and he suffers at the hand of his rulers. One morning we find that his cell, the place he is to die someday, is empty- much like the tomb of Christ. He then finishes the movie by redeeming Red, the ""only guilty man in Shawshank prison"".I could go on and on about these lower level film analytics. This movie is filled with all sorts of lessons which will shine through for different audience members.Side note, I watched this movie on a editing system which took out F bombs and other foul language. For those who would only ever see this movie if edited, it is definitely worth it."	9
 Movie Perfection	It doesn't get much better than this. Perfect performances throughout, wonderful direction... just amazed it didn't do well when first released. Time put it in its rightful place though... top of the tree!	10
 Perfect entertiament	What can you say about this film. spawned from a short story by Stephen King and adapted into this pure masterpiece with amazing acting - highly recommend	9
 Amazing movie	The Shawshank Redemption was one of those movies that I had heard the title to at some point in my life, though knew nothing about. One day, I was scrolling through Hulu and came across it. I decided to watch it. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made. It was enthralling to follow Andy throughout his journey in prison, and I loved that Morgan Freeman was not only a major part of the storyline, but he narrated it, and it followed his story as well. I have seen this twice now, and would definitely watch it again.	10
 I like this film	Iam so like this film.Although this film was produced in the 1994s, content and techniques were not bad. Image quality is also very good.	9
 great its so nice and cute i love it	So nice perfect how are u i hope u have a nice day	10
 Unique story	There is a movie that you should watch throughout your life	10
 An amazing and thought provoking film about so much more than the premise suggests that can teach us all something about life, respect, hope, and how all films should be made.	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the greatest film that had ever been made I have viewed it multiple times over the years and it never gets old. It is the story of a man imprisoned for a crime he did not commit, and then he must try with all he can to escape from there. It is a story we've seen or heard a thousand times. It is nothing new. And that is the beauty of it. We think we're here to see the same old story yet again, however, it will shock and surprise you as it unfolds. It is a story of brotherhood behind bars, of an unlikely friendship that last a lifetime, and, of redemption.	10
 One of the best	I can watch this over and over. The cast, the writing, directing, the story is spot on. I loved the ending. Never gets boring or old, full of emotion. Excellent movie.	10
 My unique classic movie	Fear can hold you prisoner. hope can set you free. a strong man can save himself. a great man can save another. You know some birds are not meant to be caged, their feathers are just too bright.	10
 Slightly over rated	Fantastic film but honestly, I don't see why it's number one on IMDb. 8 at best	8

 1	Boi, this movie this movie this movie.where do i begin? the movie is just... everyone knows what im talking about right? the effects, the acting, the soundtrack, everything is what it is.When I saw this movie, I really saw this movie. I felt like I was watching a movie.In the end though, this movie has its issues. For example, there is one scene in particular that everyone who has watched the movie will know what im talking about when I say it hit hard, maybe a bit too hard. On the other hand, it blew me away.	8
 No good things ever die.	Why it is greatest movie ever made.No beautiful heroine in movie.No nudity.No good looking hero also (with 6 pack abs).No love story. (Remember it release in 1994)It is era of love story movie yet no single second of love story in this epic movie...And so on.may be there are movie in future with 4-5 Billion dollar grossing, but never beat this movie.	10
 BEST YOU CAN EVER SEE...	Probably the best movie ever made... Motivational... Quotes are simply amazing...	10

 Highly performed Actors	This Movie is just as good as the Actors who perform in such a great Way.I felt like im in Shawshank myself, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins made this Movie so amazing.The Story behind it is even more impressive.	10
 Its #1 for a reason(interesting story look it up)	So yeah this is probably the best movie ive ever seen in my life. Its brilliantly shot(roger deacons of course) magnificently scored, perfectly acted by the entire cast,heart warming,heart breaking and uplifting in equal measure. Its a classic for a damn good reason and I hope it gets a 4k release for its 25th aniversery.	10
 Why I began working in film...	This movie, The Shawshank Redemption, is that reason. It was so theatrically performed to such a high degree its hard to surpass. I recommend this movie to everyone.	9

 An all-time gem!	This is one movie I never tire of watching. 27 times and going strong!!!	10

 Amazing Movie with Amazing Story	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	9
 Perfect Movie		10
 me	I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for.	9
 me	I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody.	9
 very good look!	This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!	10
 Timeless Classic	I believe this to be the best movie made. It never gets old even after it is played in marathon on television every year.	10
 aaaaa	This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!	8
 what's goeing on	I am so comfused_this movie is perfect acting and writing annd........This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!	8

 Great movie	One of the best movies that I have ever seen. The casting was brilliant. storyline was fabulous. A movie that you can watch over and over and never get tired of it.	8
 Shall be considered Prison Break season 0	When I seen this movie in Top250, I could not believe it, thought it was a joke. It is probably some boring old movie, maybe even without colors. But I was amazed. Similar to Prison Break series, just older version of it. Adventure, Lesson, Inspiration, Motivation, Insight, Experience, Confidence, Emotions...all in one. Good ending too. It lacks nothing. It teaches us to fight for freedom, and not just ordinary freedom like from prisons or psych wards, but freedom from people, diseases, poor life, anything negative or bad. It gives insight into feeling of being released from some institution for those who have not experienced it.	10
 Awesome Movie	Good direction and perfect cinematography brings this movie at its best.	9
 Very touching movie	This is one of the best movie of all time! Don't waste any more time and go watch it Now!	10
 Amazing!!!	Watched this movie a thousand times! It's emotional and intense. I discovered that was based in a Stephen King book just few years ago. I think he is the best horror writer ever!!	10
 the most common review	It's the best!!!it's the first!!!and ... it deserves this...!!!	10
 Profesional	I love this film. I hope it's similar to these films	10
 Best Movie Ever	"Best Movie Ever That i Watched On The UniverseIt is an unusual remark to make about a film set inside a jail, however ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes a warm hang on our sentiments since it makes us an individual from a family. Numerous motion pictures offer us vicarious encounters and speedy, shallow feelings. ""Shawshank"" backs off and looks. It utilizes the storyteller's quiet, attentive voice to incorporate us in the narrative of men who have shaped a network in the slammer. It is more profound than most movies; about coherence in a lifetime, in view of companionship and expectation."	10
 good movie	GreattttErrrr... I guess that's supposed to be enemies. But in any case, who needs those extra nice-to-	7
 Movie of all Movies	My favourite movie since I was a child. I can't imagine going into the profession of acting without the hundreds of viewings I seem to have given this title. Stellar acting and storytelling, not a single wasteful moment of screentime and the music choices were incredible.	10
 Emotional, intense, yet human	THis movie is one of the best that has been released over the last couple of decades and to me it is a timeless one as well. I truly believe that the story line and acting will hold up against anything out today, This movie provides viewers a story that is raw and emotional, though it is a simpler film than some it leaves an impression upon the viewer and touches something in the deepest part of our humanness.	9
 The GOAT	Greatest Movie Ever, captures everything you'd want in a movie. Even a love story, an amazing bromance (I hate that I used that word) but 'shrug'.	10
 Mare than 10 times.....	I have watched this movie more than 10 times and still I'm speechless. This movie gives me strength to live in hard times. After watching this movie first time I always speak to myself that don't give up HOPE. But it's very much hard to find friend like Red or maybe prototype like him in real world. This movie gives me strength to move on and never forget those people who left you in in your bad time, so when the RIGHT time comes you can smack them hard. Always love to watch this movie whenever I get time.	10
 Great Film	A really good film , Loved it.Well worth a watch.	10
 Best of the best	This movie and the back to the future trilogy, is the best you can watch if you want a really good one. Clever, interesting, long but you dont realize it because is so well done and so interesting that you never get bored. I higly recomend to watch it if you didnt yet. For some reason is the number 1 ;). Watch it, you wont regreat.	10
 This movie proves that no walls can ever hold us back from hoping.	The Best in the History, the genius performances, the greatness of the story and the beautiful simple end that make you adore the movie and forget the suffering that the characters face, everything is extraordinary	9
 one of the best movie has ever made	This movie has lots of passion lots of actors that goes deep in their roles i recommended to every on watch this fabulous movie.	9
 I am delighted!	Great movie, deep meaning, I have no words, every second of the movie keeps suspense	10
 Masterpiece!	I watched this movie a long time ago and I only can say it is a masterpiece!	10
 BEST EVER	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. giving 8/10	8
 Worthwhile to view.	I don't know why I had selected the film on Hotstar, may be due to the look of Freeman on the thumbnail. But after completing the viewing there was a calm fulfilment of mind. The depth of the storyline, the conservative attitude of direction, the mesmerized background music, the excellence in lighting made the film so matured. Freeman was good as well and Gunton was superb. Thanks to the director.	8
 Just amazing	You could sum up this movie in just one word: Amazing!The actors and the screenplay is fantastic and unlike anything I've ever seen.	10
 Classic movie	One of the best movies of all time. I just loved the movie. the storyline is amazing and really catchy. The cast is perfect and did a real justice to the movie. The lead actor Tim Robbins looked like a lame character initially but as the movie progressed he just got intense and was totally hooked to the movie and kind of got institutionalized with the movie lol.!	9
 Darling, Never, ever lose your HOPE...	The most exciting movie I've ever seen and it has an impact on my life attitude. Even if your dearest love betrayed you, even if you are in a prison and in fact you are innocent, you have to keep faith. Work, work everyday and never lose your hope. The god will be with you.	10
 Best ever	We cant see movie like that anymore. Evrybody most see this masterpieces before dead.	10
" ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	"Shawshank Redemption is a simple but amazing film with an everlasting message.Although there's no action or special effects, this movie keeps you interested from the beginning to the end. You have friendships, difficulties, dreams and most importantly: you have hopes. All that Shawshank Redemption is about is ETERNAL HOPE! And I think this theme is what makes this movie so special. Not only you find something relatable (even though the circumstances that the characters are in probably have nothing to do with you), but you think about the message, about the movie. And after you watch it you feel motivated, even grateful for what you have. You feel hope. And that's exactly how you should feel because as the movie says ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	8
 This film will challenge your worldview and inspire you!	Andy Defrene's character is a proxy for any man or woman who honestly wants to achieve something in their life, and meets obstacles with tenacity and ingenuity. A wonderfully told tale that inspires we every time I re-watch it!	10
 A must see !	An amazing story with a great narrator throughout in Morgan Freeman. There's tragedy and irony and wraps up in a very satisfying and pleasing way !	10
 It's all about good story for me.	When i first saw this film i was abot 8 or 10 years old. Now i am 21 and what can i say about it? This film make me fill batter in all possible concepts because of people who created it an especially Stephen King because he is my favorite author. This film is all about freedom and justice in the world that we lived and how can you fight with your own fears in your life and never give up on your dreams or hopes.Everybody must see. Thanks. Peace.	9
 Good.	Very good. A very good movie. Yes.I was 2 years old when this movie came out. I remember it like it was yesterday.Very good.	9
 Get busy living or get busy dying: A Deeply moving tale with a perennial message.	No words to describe this movie. This is the best movie I have ever watched. It felt flawless ! It truly deserves to be the first in IMDB top 250. Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman are amazing.	10
 Awesome	Great acting, magnificent story. Nothing more to be said	10
 Legendary film	Felt like it was real , such a good acting and direction. Hatsoff for good story line script , acting , location and last but not least the direction.	10
 the best of the best	This is one of my top 10'S. the drama is real along with the situations of human struggle. i could sit and watch all day. and it is a must have for my collection. The Shawshank Redemption did an amazing job of making the audience feel in the cell along with the actor . 10/10	10
 Definitely recommend	This film is one of the best films I've ever seen. It gives you a realistic story line of how the prison system works. My friends first Persuaded me to watch it, while I thought it was going to be very boring, and now it is one of my favourite films. It makes you go on an emotional rollercoaster and the ending is so unpredictable. My friends and I still quote this movie and having seen it a hundred times we still all love it. It is a great film to watch with family and friends and is an all time classic to watch.	10
 The greatest movie of all time	This movie is the absolute pinnacle of human creativity and intelligence. One of, if not the best movies I have ever seen in my entire lifetime and that we will ever see in human history. The movie touches upon all parts of life from respect, accountability, intelligence, decency, friendship and much more. The movie tells us so much about us as humans and how even at the lowest moments in our lives, one can and must redeem themselves. The bond between Andy, Red, and the viewer is absolutely unbreakable and I shed tears even time I watch the movie. As I have said before, The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest movie of all time.	10
 Shawshank Redemption it's just flawless.	Director Frank Darabont not only created the movie of the year, he created a movie of the century with stunning yet beautiful cinematography to both Morgan Freeman Tim Robbins performance that makes Shawshank Redemption is one of the best.	10
 Without ruining the best film of all time with spoilers	I think irregardless of whether or not you've gone through the judicial system in some formality, every American can very much appreciate this culture rich, drama of pure Spielberg genius!Just because I saw it when I was 10, I wouldn't suggest letting your kid see it lol!	10
 BIG LOVE	Without a doubt - one of the best movies I ever sawI highly recomend it for everyone looking for a good movie.Might be one of my favourite ones!	10
 GREATEST Movie Of All TIME!	What a movie! can't describe with word, a Movie i watched more than 10times!	10
 Amazing film	I wached the film 4 times and i loved the film every once	10
 One of the powerful movies I have ever seen.	It was pretty much exactly what I expected which is a really enjoyable and lighthearted film with some funny moments and that will be enough for most people but it just didn't blow me away. No way this is a 10 like some are suggesting and to nitpick, adult Billy acts nothing like young Billy at all. Don't get me wrong - its still a fun movie which I can recommend.	9
 Yes or no ?	Fantastic movie and maybe the best ever... enjoy !	10
 perfect	Perfect in a single word..it was my first film to watch in a cinema..	10
" Maybe not ""The Greatest"", but it's a triumph nonetheless"		9
 Best Movie EVER!!!	I NEVER get tired of seeing this movie. I like period pieces. And the acting and cinematography is ON POINT. This is my favorite film.	10
 Must read		9
 The Shawshank's Redeeming Reputation		10
 the best movie	I've recently watched this movie and i found this movie the best one so far	10
 Really Good	Good movie to watch. complete movie really interesting to watch.	
 One of the finest movie	One of the finest movie. I have ever seen. The Shawshank Redemption is all about friendships, emotions, hopes, dream, hardships. No one can beat this movie when it comes about the direction.	10
 Quite simply the best film ever made	There is no better film than this, it's just incredible. Morgan Freeman is absolutely brilliant.	10
 Perfect movie	It's Great !! if you love a drama movie you will love this too	10
 I think it is not rank1 but it is a good film that have to seen.	"I was a little surprised at first to see this film because it is rank 1 in imdb but when i saw this film, my opponion is ""it is not rank 1"", some other film like pappilon is better than it that has a same subject. Start and end are attractive but middle is afew boring."	7
 i love it.	This movie was great. I hope that such films will be produced in the world	10
 One of the best films ever!	"10 of 10 I can't find flaws really. highly recommended :"")Btw this is my first review on IMDB!"	10
 Good film	Best film which i seen all time. Many films about of action, good.	10
 Classic	Im gonna sound like everybody else when I say this, but the movie is great from beginning to end. I never even planned to watch this movie it just came on while I was watching tv one night. The movie is a classic and if you have not watched it yet please do!	10
 I love true story	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 We've Got to Get Out of This Place!	"At this writing I see that there is already 6,329 reviews of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on IMDb so what the heck, I'll throw in my two cents worth.""The Shawshank Redemption"" was adapted from a Stephen King novelette about a wrongly convicted murderer's 19 year odyssey through Shawshank prison in Maine. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. We don't learn until later that he really was innocent. Andy is taken under the wing of veteran lifer Red Redding (Morgan Freeman) who shows him the ways of prison life.Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) is a strict Bible thumper who together with his sadistic Captain of the Guards Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown), maintain order within the prison. A convict named Bogs (Mark Rolston) sets his sights on Andy for homosexual purposes. Andy is continuously attacked by Bogs and his friends. While working on a roof top, Andy overhears Hadley's complaints over taxes on a small inheritance. Andy tells Hadley of a way in which he can avoid any taxes. As his ""fee"" Andy asks for beer for his co-workers which puts him favor with the group. Later, when Bogs and his gang rough up Andy, Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp and renders him a parapalygic.Warden Norton sees possibilities in Andy and re-assigns him to the prison library being run by lifer Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore). Andy through an exhaustive letter writing campaign, manages to gain funding from the state to expand the library along with a supply of used books. Andy does Income taxes for the guards and tutors some prisoners as well. Norton is impressed Under a scheme where prisoners are loaned out to the community for work on public projects, Norton develops a kick back scheme and employs Andy to keep the books for him.A young convict named Tommy (Gil Bellows) comes to the prison and after gaining the confidence of Andy and Red, tells a tale of a prisoner that he had shared a cell with who admitted to killing Andy's wife and lover. Andy goes to Warden Norton to seek a new trial. Norton not wanting to lose Andy because of his accounting skills, refuses to help him. An argument ensues and Andy is thrust into solitary.When he is released from solitary, Andy becomes distant and becomes a loner. What he is really doing is hatching an elaborate frame-up of Norton and his cronies while also planning to escape. One morning g at roll call Andy does not answer and......................................................................................This film deservedly was nominated for seven Academy Awards. The acting is superb. Robbins and Woodward are tremendous as the two main characters. Gunton and Brown are great as the main villains. But veteran James Whitmore almost steals the movie with his sympathetic portrayal of the paroled lifer who tries to adjust to society after 50 years in prison.A great movie."	9
 Purely Amazing	There are many reasons why this movie is rated number 1. All reasons I understand, The music, the acting , and more importantly everything. Although I have rated The Green Mile higher, that's solely just on preference. This is by far the definition of films. Until today I never knew this was Morgan Freeman's fist time doing narration, and you would never guess that it was his first time dong one based on how perfect he does it in this. Tim Robbins is the perfect fit for this role and I can not see Tom Hanks as Andy Dufrense. The story telling in this film is marvelous and the entirety of the film has a deeper meaning. There's a reason you study this film in High School, there is so much to analyze and study. For me the best part of the movie is the ending that sweet shot of the camera zooming out of the beach and Andy walking towards Red and the music in this scene almost makes enough for you to cry. Considering how little Frank Darabont had to work with considering this film is based of Stephen Kings short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption he was able to stick entirely true to the novel and still make it a feature length film. The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film of all time and if you haven't seen this film, I don't know what your doing with your life as this is a much.	9
 A true time classic	"It started the ""prison escape genre"" with a number of movies referencing scenes from this. A true masterpiece."	8
 Amazing	This movie got it all, comedy, drama etc. It also based on a true story that makes the movie even better. It's a incredible story about this young man and his journey trough life and the obstacles he need to overtake are not easy.	10
 Wonderful Character Development and Storyline	The building of characters and stories behind each one is wonderfully done.	9
 What makes movies 'art'	A truly astonishing film that encapsulates messages of life, institutionalization and redemption. Memorizing story and acting, the first film that I watched that made me accept film as a medium of art.	10
 perfect	A classic piece of unforgettable film making. and a great movie to watch. I would recommend it to everyone. without spoilers and watch yourself feeling happy	10
 what i think	I dont think it good as name..........................	7
 I can watch this a million times over!	Absolutely one of the best films made.. It is made with such art and talent.	10
 Perfect	Very nice movie players have played very nice. director's camera angles were nice	10
 Fxr the best mxvie I have ever seen		9
 A must watch movie	We must have to experience this movie.An awesome creation	9
 Unforgettable movie	It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.when you see the movie you will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 What a great movie!!!!!	It is masterpiece by morgen freeman and tim robbins.A movie about passion and freindship	10
 Timeless	The review says it all, timeless. Smart educational film. From the beginning to the end. Tim Robbins at first, you assume he is either a wrong person but when you gradually continue watching the film. His characters rub into you, converting him to be a good character. The story-line was terrific for sure one of my favourite movies of all time. The incredible story-line, highly recommend to watch it if you have not seen this before.	10
 Best	It is movie that inspires me always.The best movie i have ever seen.	10
 2019. 25 years later...	I watched it first as a 13 year old and somehow back then at that age was able to comprehend how powerful and meaningful this movie is. Now at 37, I still smile and my heart still aches when I watch the last minute of this terrific film.It's my favorite film. Was my father's as well. I watch it at least once every 5 or so years and despite knowing its every beat, I still love it as much now as I did when I first watched it.It timeless. There's just something about it. Friendship, hope, and never give up. In other words, get busy living. That's what it wants to say and succeeds in doing so.	10
 Fabbbbbb 😍	This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!	9
 Magnifique	Excellent film about the will to overcome any odds and stay positive.	9
 Amazed	The dramatic experience we have never ever seen before.... Amazing ;-)	10
 must see	Probably the best movie you will ever see and must buy on DVD	10
 Lovely Rita, Meter Maid	Currently this is the top rated movie on IMDb Top 250 -- and has been for many years -- and the reason is that this story can relate to everyone. That's not to say that, like Andy Dufresne, everyone was literally in prison, no, but in a quietly profound way it addresses a fundamental aspect of the human condition that everyone can relate to. Whether it's a housewife who's lived the same day for twenty years, or her workaholic husband who's also lived the same life for twenty years, it seems many people, judging by popularity of the film, consciously or unconsciously see this film as a metaphor for their own lives. Freedom is the issue here. Freedom from monotony, from despair, from death. Freedom to build boats or listen to Mozart or feel the sting of rain on your skin. What Andy Dufresne wanted was what we all want in our quiet moments, perhaps in the evening while we lie in bed, or in the rare instances when we have nothing to do and nothing to distract us. Andy Dufresne is us, magnified. The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie and that's what great movies do: they provide a mirror in which we can see ourselves.	9
 The Greatest plot twist of all time	I saw the move 2 times and every time experience it again .. Great move great acting and directing .	9
 Everybody see this movie.	This movie is very good fun.Everybody like to see more times.All character is very good show.Thank you for this movie.	8
 Forget the goofs.	I was so much into this movie that I couldnt realize even one mistake listed in the goofs.	10
 It's worth watching	Must Watch Movie! Total justice to the IMDB No. 1 stature.	10
 The Shawshank redemption	Such a great story line one of my most loved movies to watch on a Saturday night with family and friends would recommend to anyone that loves the thrill you get from movies	9
 I love this film	I'm now expert reviewer by any stretch at all. But by films end if this film doesn't bring as positive tear to my eye every time (which is a crap load) what's to say it isn't a 10/10! I love this film I always will. It's timeless and inspiring.	10
 Best	One of the best movies in history of cinema.Strong content, Beautiful and spectacular theme.	10
 The best movie ever	Shawshank redemption is one of the greatest movies in the history of movies production ...This movie has drama suspense Comedy and it aced all these categoriesBefore talking about this movie we should mention that it wasn't the great movie in the year of its production ...hadn't a great success in cinema because in 1994 there were alot of magnificent moviesBut actually this movie is the best and we easily can prove it by looking at the top 10 movies in IMDB and we could easily understand that it's the 1st since I was bornI rated this movie 10 and i was pleased watching it	10
 masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption was my favourite movie for many years, but it was beaten after i watched the good the bad and the ugly; but that doesn't change anything a felt about this movie and how brilliant it really is. This movie has the best character development in movie history! It shows the way prison life has on people; especially those who have been wrongly accused, the slow decent into madness and depression as the years go by. Also, theres not many movies that make you truly hate a character because of there wicked and evil acts, Warden Norton and Captain Hadley are deceptive and cruel to the inmates of the prison, and i smiled when there story came to an end. The leading Actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman display some of the finest acting in movie history, their skills make the audience feel sorry for them at emotional times in the movie and its difficult for a movie to make the audience feel that way. As for the script, it is written perfectly and is major highlight the movie, again; this is improved further because of the amazing performances from the cast. the story is a story of loss, hope... and redemption, it may seem like a normal prison movie at first, but soon enough you'll really begin to appreciate how inspirational the movie really is. As the for the climax, The Shawshank Redemption has one of the most bitter sweet endings of all time. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time, it will be remembered in the media until the end of days; this is the movie the directors of today should watch to see what cinema is all about.	10
 Simply a masterpeice	Greatest of all time! the pace of the movie is just perfect	
 Magnificent	Best movie EVER!!! The cast and director are perfectly matched together and created a masterpiece.	10
 One of the best movie ive ever seen	Trully a masterpiece of the resilience of a man who fulfilled is redemption trough a journey in a world to whom he does not belong. In the end, a human experience in the underworld of the prison life. A just man who unjustly embark on a journey on the path of the murderer of his own wife.	9
 one of the best movies	Really dramatic movie. this is a film that is experiencing a combination of patience and determination	10
 One of the best film	One of the best film. I love the background score.Everybody was best.	9
 40years I've been in here	Morgan Freeman great leading actor. Stephen King short story novella such a great non fiction.	10
 The film conveys emotions to viewers	I have considered a lot but the emotions never changed, it made me feel like I was getting into the movie.	10
 good movie	I can't get enough of this movie it is really good to watch	10
 Beautiful movie	One of the best exciting movie.I enjoyed it. I hope to see it again soon.	9
 Nice one	Such a nice movie. Quite interesting storyline and nice actors.	10
 Nothing is impossible	No one can take away your hope in your mind. 19 years' waiting in the jail. Nothing is impossible.The movie showcase an intense passion to crave for freedom. The man utimately regain control of his life. Every single man on earth should live a life as the male lead does. A very encouraging film.	9
 A beautifully heart-capturing drama	The film shows the sinister circumstances of prisons in the US in former times. The plot tells of an unbreakable friendship that has grown for all these years behind bars. Hope dies last...	8

 For freedom and life		10
 LOVE IT	GreAT FILM AND LOVE IT SO MUCH and great story LOVE IT	6
 Just Brilliant.	A very compelling movie. The acting is impeccable and the suspense is real. The plot was not predictable something that is unusual for a movie. All I have to say is that this is probably one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!	10
 Stephen Kings best movie adaptation	"Based on the Stephen King novella ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Of the many Stephen King stories that were made into movies, this is the truest adaptation. It was nominated and should have won best picture in 1993. The movie was cast perfectly with outstanding performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Clancy Brown."	9
 A Study of Humanity	Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite films of all time. The story of Andy Dufresne characterizes the ups and downs of humanity.	10
 This is the review number 6264... not bad, huh?	I clearly remember reading the novel by Stephen King before the movie was even conceived. Yes, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb in this movie, as well as any supporting actor. And yes, Frank Darabont made a stunning work to transfer the story onto the screen, but to me Stephen King remains the real reason why this film is still the number one here on IMDb. Story and characters are magnificently powerful already on the book and the film director managed to follow every page slavishly.	10
 BLOODY EXCELLENT	This movie is just bloody excellent, brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way)	10
 Great!	Great movie! The acting and the story really draws you in.	9
 A real redemption	I want to start my review with confessing that it was my best film everAlso the standard time of the film is one and thirty minutes , some times I think to myself how can a film (this cilm) have such heavy meaning with this shot time in different subjects .And other side of the powder of film was goddam good actors and also a supernatural screen playWhen I Want to talk about weaknesses of this fim I can say nothing but optimistic parts of scaping from prison and the other parts but it can't be flaw maybe it's how director see things .Mahan fekri	9
 MasterPiece	How can I explain this movie in one simple review! It's impossible...Excellent work	10
 Cool	Cool i really love this genre of movies because i'm a really huge fan of this director	9
 nice movie	Amazing like it. how beautiful freedom is so important	10
 Great movie	This movie is so good. I like it.	10
 Great movie	I finally watched this movie today and I should have watched it way sooner. This is probably the most interesting movie I have ever seen; It has a very intriguing plot and there isn't any dull moments. You will feel so connected with the characters who were portrayed very well I got to say. Its a disgrace this movie did so badly in the box office. You should definitely watch this movie, even if you're not into drama movies because this a very intriguing movie.	10
 Great Movie	Really shocked by the true feelings of this film, it is worthy of a long-lasting good film, other feelings, I believe that you will experience the natural experience.	10
 Wonderful movie with touching storyline - An emotional rollercoaster	"There are very few movies which have the power to change a person's life. A two and a half hour movie which has the power to turn your long darkest hours into the most delightful moments if you are really willing to feel every bit of the movie. This movie gave me a hope and reminded me of a quote that ""tough times never last but tough people do"". There are a lot more things to learn from this movie. Don't miss them because you may never come across them in your life so beautifully. This is my first review which I strongly felt to be posted."	10
 A Best film I have ever seen	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus	10
 awesome movie	This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen.	10
 There's A Reason It's The Highest Rated Film On IMDb	This is one of my all time favourite films. As it is for loads of people. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances, as well as the other cast members. The characters are also very likeable, thanks to said actors. Now this film has little to no action, but it doesn't need it, everything else in the film is just as interesting, so my mind doesn't wander. The film is emotional when it needs to be, it's funny when it needs to be and it's always entertaining.	10
 Movie of the century	Its one of those movies that teaches the appreciation of life. The movie is masterfully crafted with an incredible story line. Every dialogue is deep, hard hitting and intriguing. There is not one forgettable character in this movie and it is a pleasure to watch how their stories develop and intertwine with the protagonist.	10
 A really good movie!	"The Shawshank Redemption is such a good movie and it's definitely worth your time watching. Not only does it have a great plot, but the acting is very good as well because of the two main characters Tim and Morgan. I really love Tims character, Andy Dufresne. The way he thinks and acts is just cool and I think everyone can agree to it.One of my favorite scenes is when he escaped after crawling through poop. When he stood in the rain the look on his face just reassured that he actually escaped and I think it's really cool. My other favorite part was when Red ( Morgan Freeman) was released from prison and he finally reunited with Andy. I think their friendshipIs pretty cool and it will have you smiling the entire movie. My favorite quote in this movie is when Red said "" Andy Dufresne. Who crawled through a river of sh## and came out clean on the other side."" This quote really reflects what happened in the story. Andy went to prison even though he was innocent and experienced some rough things, but he ended up escaping and is now living his best life. His escape is definitely epic and I recommend this movie for everyone."	9
 A complete classic	Watch it if you haven't.I've watched it a about 15 times and it always get goosebumps at some scenes.	10
 Inccreible Films	This film is encreible the best film in te word.I like this film	10

It is a classic and an amazing film thanks to incredible writing & outstanding acting.	10
 Pioneering	This film paved the way for prison films and series of a similar style. The acting was beautifully done. A bit too long- my only gripe	8

 Legend!	The movie deserves to be first movie of top 250. i think it was a flawless film in all respects.	10
 Greatest movie	The greatest movie of all time.... absolutely brilliant	10
 best drame movie ever	I Can Not Say This Is The BEST MOVIE I Have Ever SeenBUTI Can Say This Is The BEST DRAMA MOVIE I Have Seen	
 TOP MOVIE OF ALL TIME.	TOP MOVIE, BEST MOVIE EVER MADE. They don't make movies like this one anymore. it's kinda sad.	10
 Amazing Movie	In my opinion it's the best movie everthey all did the best performance	10
 Long rainy nights of the prison	You have to live this movieI didn't know it after watching it 10 times but finely I got the feelingSome masterpieces should be watched listened and read for 10000 times until they'd be comprehended completelyLong night of prisonYou'll never get outNo hopeNo fairytaleBut there might be redemption	10
 Amazing	Such an amazing and inspirational movie. One you can watch again and again... 👍🏻 Full stars from myself.	10
 Best Scene	This is the Best Movie Ever in the World and I Watch this Movie in three times.I Recommend Every One to Watch this Movie	6
 one of my favorites	A great movie that is now a classic. definitely in my top 10. some of the best characters and best character development i've ever seen in a movie.	9
 Great but then nothing more than that	This is a movie where you can't point out a single flaw or mistake in it and that is rare and the only reason I gave it 6/10. Not having any flaws or mistakes or simply just not enough for it to have a higher rating. There is nothing really to interpret in the movie and everything is pretty much laid out for you. It is a classic and you can always watch it without feeling bored throughout the movie but if you are looking for a movie with a deeper meaning this is not it.	6
 A true classic film	Took me a long time to see this movie, but finally decided to watch it and wasn't disappointed. Probably most movie fanatics know the movie so I won't focus on the movie that much, but the feeling of watching it. This one truly feels like a classic story with the storytelling, having a clear plot, but still keeping us on your toes on what is going to happen. It depicts in a real fashion on how life can be and not being boring at any point. Story guides on one direction, but every moment feels like it could turn to a different direction. Really great storytelling, creating the feeling of hopelessness, character build and classic plot from start to finish. I truly enjoyed watching this from start to finish, nothing felt superimposed.	10
 Filmfrtghfghfghfgh	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	7
 TOP	The best movie I've been watching for the last couple of yearsFrom the acting itself, the script, the direction, and everything else. One big bravo	10
 The Shank	Absolutely enjoy this film. It puts you in the perspective of being within the system and in a mans head to escape. Probably one of my favorite.	10
 Never get boring from this icpnic movie	Every time I watch this movie I feel like it was the first time	10
 An ode to hope	Simply awesone, it goes much beyond the Stephen King's short story.	10
 Excelent	I dont't have any words best !!!! this movie inspired me and asked me at the same time recomande	10
 One of the best movies in the world	One of the best movies in the world. Still in 2019 an very impressive movie.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie.	8
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994) / Review	"""Hope can set you free."" An extraordinary film well oiled by it's cast. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver. This Stephen King novela turned film, immediately captivates the audience's attention with the murder of a wife and lover. The shifting point of view from Andy's character to Red in the beginning of the film also guides us into wondering ""Who is Andy Dufrense?"". Morgan Freeman's incredible narration paints a canvas of life behind bars and how vulnerable they are outside it. The best film of the year despite also being the most underrated. Over the years, like fine wine, it has cemented its place in the archives of cinema. If there's one thing to take from this film... ""Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying."""	10
 Masterpiece	Got me right in the feels. Was speechless after watching, so breathtaking in every way	9
 Good Film	The movie is very interesting and you can watch it more than one time the story in this movie is very interesting cool too watch	9
 Absolutely best movie of all time	They just don't make movies like this spectacular piece of art	10
 One of the Masterpieces I have seen	First thing you need to see this movie is real patience. I am not kidding. This movie will test your patience. Story moves real slow but if you watch it completely, it's real worth it.	10
 Fantastic Movie !	Looks so great movie ! i like it to much !I hope to be able to watch an exciting film like this again. I'm waiting for an update on the latest video from this site	10
 Best Movie Ever	This is one of the best movie I have ever seen. I usually do not have patience to watch a movie in one sitting. But for this one, it kept me interested and I watched it without missing a single dialogue. Morgan Freeman narration is one of the best part of this movie.	10
 About a very very long escape from prison	It's amazing how long I could not watch this movie. However, I became interested in them only after reading the book. And the book is very good. However, the same can be said about the film. Yes, there are some nuances ...	10
 One of the Greatest Movies of all Time	Genius. Perfect. Great Story. Great Actors. One of my favourite movies. Too bad that nowadays they'll never make a movie as half as good as this	10
 Best movie I have seen	This movie is one of those kind of movies that would move you on the power of bond and friendship. This movie tells to us that life with friends there to comfort you would make life worth all the pain and the obstacles. I was completely moved.	10
 the best movie	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films of all time, and is considered the best drama ever. If you ask the people on the street what is the best movie ever, you will probably hear the name of this film. Although it was built without the expectation of a high box office, it produced a great interest in the whole world, which attracted great attention (this type of film was called sleeper). morgan freeman and tim robbins' best films wouldn't be wrong. The story of two prisoners who met in prison and were close friends. An impressive scenario, flawless acting and a legend. As if you are having the movie you are caught up in the story. so much so that no one could have been touched in the final with no sense of age. Many scenes and dialogs on the internet are still breaking records on the Internet. a film that definitely and strictly needs to be monitored.	10
 Extremely well acted	I loved this movie, its one of those movies you can watch over and again and never get tired of fantasizing about a different outcome. The reality of long prison sentences and what that does to some individuals was well depicted in this film. One of my all time favorites!	10
 Mind blowing	The best movie ever made people think that the end makes it an incredible movie but it's not because of the end it is how Red and Andy build chemistry together it's one of the best movies about hope. This is my favourite film of all time and it should be everybody's favourite film I don't know how Forrest Gump won best picture over this nobody praises Forrest Gump anymore but people still praise the shawahank redemption because it's that good so yeah I would highly recommend this film you will not regret the it.	10
 BEST MOVIE EVER	IT IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN JUST THE END TWIST AND THE BEGINNG WHICH TOLD US IT I A SERIOUS MOVIE	10
 The touch of the deep side of my heart	This film gave me the maximal inspirations and deeply touched my inner heart as I finally knew how to cope with everything when the whole world goes against you, and the way to get over everything when the god unleash the hell on you. For me, I am now facing the greatest challenge ornament my life as I have to conquer all sorts of difficulties to successfully get the good grades in my university	10
 Hi	One of the nicest films ever and immortal in memory	10
 My Lord this is the best film of all time.	How one can go through his/her life without having seen this film baffles me. On a technical level, the film is essentially flawless. but it succeeds even more on such a greater level. Film was not created for the mind, to be over-analysed and critiqued to the point of removing all feeling and stripping a piece of art down to its individual frames. Film was created for the heart, and there's a reason Shawshank is rated #1 of all time, and will never be beaten. The raw emotion and empathy we feel toward Andy throughout the film says much about the successes of humanity, and more importantly the power of hope. Everyone involved in this film caught lighting in a bottle and made quite possibly the greatest piece of art of the 20th century, if not of all time. Beats Forrest Gump any day of the week.	10
 wonderfulllll	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 shawshank	Hmm..see other reviews and this give me wish for watch this film, and lets begin watch today.	
 The best movie of all time	A masterpiece! A movie you will never forget! The best storyline and the best actors!	10
 Best ever	This is not a depressing movie, it's about hope and the reality of life. I will be forever grateful for this movie.	9
 A little overrated, but still phenomenal.	This film is a little bit overrated, but is still one of the greatest stories EVER told, and has one of the greatest conclusions I have ever seen in a film.	9
 Love this movie	It is always a movie i will watch when i have nothing to watch or just want to watch a good prison film. The Shawshank Redemption my best film ever	10
 They don't make movies like this anymore	It's only the best movie ever. If anyone hasn't seen it yet I don't know what the hell they are watching	10
 Truly a redemption!	A rush of mixed feelings- confusion, disappointment, anger, huff, altogether creating a decision, and the aftermath becomes regrettable! A life sentence to prison brings an innocent heart among the minds of criminals, and strict prison security. But, as time passes, the truth and the beauty unfolds. Everyone in there is innocent. Just the lawyers screwed them! Also, the friendship grew between two people, and how they turned the prison into something else, something much more beautiful than the outer world. Spending decades in there gradually becomes living in there. The struggle, the livelihood, the fun, the everyday life, turn the people Institutional! At a point it'll feel like, We belong there! Altogether, the discipline, the rules, the cold bars of cells, the lives, the dreams, the hopes, the redemption, these all just put one's whole life in front of your eyes!Jack may have a family now. Many people have also been there, after Red. Andy can see his customers go fishing. And yes, We now know a good use of the Bible!	10
 Very good movie	The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.	10
 Probably the best movie of all time	This film has some of the best movie line that will inspire me through all the time.whenever i fell bore or something this film make me keep going.when i see that man who had a dream , dream that all he had.that dream, that freedom of life, that his wisdom of thought.in all those movie i watched in my life there is some of them that inspire me,that give me strength this movie is one of them.one of the best line that is to sayhope is the best thing , probably the best of thingand no good thing ever dies.	10
 Amazing movie	I've seen this movie several times because it inspires me.	10
 ...	One of the best adaptations of some King's. The film is one of the trademarks of the 90's and is on the list of my favorite films because of acting, acting, choosing actors and everything else.	10
 Musharr	Musharr, the only word you can use about this film and fiction. I saw Jondin once, and I could not see any flaws or mistakes in the movie. Definitely the film of Shoshrooz is one of the best films in the world. If the movie was high, I could say that the best film in the world is in terms of impact on the viewer.	9
 What a movie!!!!	Oh dear, one of the finest movies that I have ever seen!The story of hope, belief, friendship and never giving up!!	10
 good job	I very like watching to movie. old movie and i always watch	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	This movie really deserves to be the first on IMDB's list of 250 Top rated movies. Everybody should see it at least once in their life. My sincere recommendetion.	10
 Confident and compelling movie!	Ast and crew have done a full and fantastic job. The continuity and confidence in the story is remarkable. The idea behind the nature of the human behaviour and comprehension of its depth is clearly visible throughout the scenes.	10
 Good movie, but best movie?		8
 GREAT Movie	I Have Seen this movie 3 times and each time i enjoyed it ! it's Awesome!	10
 Hope.	A good movie about hope that shows the persistence of a falsely accused man. Tim Robbins does a good job at Andy Dufresne, but I think that without Morgan Freeman as Red (Ellis Boyd Redding), this movie would not be the same. I read the book, novella, whatever you want to call it, and it was different for the better, and there are multiple inside jokes/references to the book. The imagination of Stephen King formed into a movie that is hard to find something as good. A great movie about Hope.	10
 Best of	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Great!	Great movie about an escape from Shawshank prison.	10
 Im really cant believe with this film, unexpected	I has seen many film alr, but this one is the real movie with unexpected ending.Awesome	9
 You have to see this movie.	This was one hell of a movie . I mean really it got everything you need in a movie whether it thrill,drama,crime ,'prison escape' .Except for that one part about how andy knew about a pipeline after the wall.	10
 Amazing Movie!	This is one of the best mind changing and super conceptual movies seen so far! A big thumbs up for the makers of this amazing The Shawshank Redemption!	9
 My favourite movie	One of my absolute favourites. So thrilling movie. The actors are great and i think the worst part of the movies story is that the murderer doesn't get locked up.	10
 Great movie	A very good movie, but not the best :) Check out spanish movies, you will be amazed.	10
 Extraordinary	From a purely emotional standpoint, this is quite simply the best film ever made; epic in scope, travelling as it does over many decades of our hero's lives, it does not disappoint in any area.The two films I return to again and again are this and Blade Runner, and despite their obvious differences, both films share many characteristics: sweeping score, wildly atmospheric, fantastic individual performances and both have aged beautifully.A resounding, joyful, 10 out of 10 to this phenomenal film.	10
 An ok movie	I remember this. I just forgot about the whole thing. I watched last night and forgot how good this movie was. Well done!	
 Hope	Its a masterpiece. never miss this film. The film make me believe about hope a thing more often people ignore, but it is very much useful in real life and facing real life problems.	10
 best	Very good and funny i love this movieactors is stars movie	10
 this movie is realy the best	When i saw this... my mind was full of hopei realy love this moviethe actors are so good	10
 Unforgettable	This movie is a must watch because of directing, acting and an excellent script. Morgan Freeman is the star of the movie. He played the best role of his professional life in Shawshank redemption.	9
 The meaning of the freedom	Never stop watching this movie every time they show it	10
 LOVE IT	Based on Stephen kings 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' this movie is a modern masterpiece that I could not recommend more, upon watching it just once it has instantly become one of my favourites. Touching and heartbreaking at times, yet at others disturbing. A grim look on the lives of the prisoners. The characters leave you attached to their individual personalities each creating a sense of sympathy from the viewer. Characters such as Brooks, an old man who looks after a wounded bird within the prison, truly shine and their individual stories leave you feeling as they feel. Brilliantly directed with touching themes such as hope, friendship and humanity within prisons makes this film truly worth the hype. Could not reccomend more. Closest thing to cinematic perfection and story telling that I have come across.	9
" ""The Shawshank redemption"" Review"	The Villain in this movie played by Bob Gunton inst just the Villain because hes the warden and the protagonist is an inmate, but because of his despicable actions that make him one of the greatest villains in all of cinematic history.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances as Andy Dufresne and Ellis Boyd Redding respectively.Time in this movie is portrayed expertly by Morgan freeman's character getting parole every 10 years and the tired expression on his face just shows.frank darabont's direction goes a hell of a long way with the direction of brooks character played marvelously by James Whitmore shows what time and captivity can do to a man it's very unsettling to think about.the scenes with Andy and the sisters and the one where Andy is in the hole just feel so real.this is one of the best movies ever made and also a personal favorite of mine.	10
 The movie must watch before die	I don't know how to express my love. What incredible movie I've seen ever. Hope is a wonderful thing, maybe best thing for lives. Never give up. Nothing is impossible if hopes is alive.	10
 pretty awesome	It's really a amazing movie 🍿 most good ratings & rating worths ! keep watching and really a must watch movie it is .	9
 a wisdom sentences	It had very attractive thoughts, wisdom sentences, and new way of thinking...i like it very much....	9
 Reviewing A Morgan Freeman Movie	"In My Opinion, the movie teaches a great lesson about friendship and survival when two people in jail together are able to endure their hardship and become friends in the process. This is a great movie to help me discover what it means to be ""human""."	7
 A perfect movie.	This movie is perfect in everything that it does and is at this time my favourite movie. I would recommend it to everybody.	10
 One of the greatest films ive ever seen	One of the most emotional films i have ever watched. From the escape to the tool in the book to a certain old man commiting suicide, the movie had me captivated and was a rollercoaster of feelings. Its easily one of the greatest pieces of movie artwork ive ever seen and there are only a handful of other movies that come close to shawshank. Morgan freeman,James whitmore and Tim Robbins carried this to greatness.	10
 One of My Most Favorite Movie	One of the best movie ever made. Can Call it a masterpiece. Just awesome. Movie making, Storytelling, Cinematography, Sound mixing and music all of them are too good. I like it so much. These kinds of movie give us the appreciation to watch more movie.Quality movie.	10

 very nice	The shawshank very nice and this movie a shortly man, maybe lelah ....	10
 A really epic movie	This movie is containing the real epic sessions and parts of life. It shows you to the sad life of a good man.	10
 Amusing Movie	I saw this movie when I was young and I am writing this review almost after 10 years watching that. Still I can remember the screenplay and the patience of the mastermind which succeed in the end. Very good plot and acting of the main actor as well should be praised without doubt. Though the movie is little bit lengthy comparing with the movies nowadays but I hope someone will not get bored while watching it. A 'must watch' movie.	9
 Slow at Start but best ending and good lessons	Movie is a bit slow at start but takes turn at the end. This movie has some greatest lessons for life	9
 It's a great movie!	Good story and cinematography, I watch it several times and every time I discover new things.	9
 when i was a little boy	I Believe In Justice delayed is justice denied,Now i glad i still trust that.	
 verrryyy goooood movie i love it	"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other."	8
 one of the finest movies	This movie is one of the finest movies produced ,the storytelling is really appealing.	9
 Unforgettable	Love this movie. Great story, great actors, Shawshank Redemption has been in my top 5 favorite movies of all (my time), a long with The Green Mile. Never get tired of Shawshank.	10
 Simply the best movie ever!!!!!!	The first words that I said as I walked out of the movie was this was I believe this was the best film I have ever seen. My wife friend and I had seen hundreds of movies preceding this in the '70's, '80's, and 90's.	10
 What more can I say?	Probably one of the best movies I've seen. Everything I could possibly say has been said but definitely a blueprint on jail scenes...	9
 it's a F masterpiece	No words can describe this movie , 1994 looks so close , when i rewatch this movie i feel like it's my first time	10
 A beautifully crafted Masterpiece	This movie is not made this is crafted and it is so much beautifully crafted that you feel mesmerising after seeing it. Entire movie will keep you spellbound. There is no doubt why the movie tops the chart in IMDb. For me this is one of the best movie I have ever seen. Beauty redefined.	10
 If you don't love this movie you are broken	"One of the finest films ever made. This jockeys for 1st or 2nd in my all time list, depending on when I'm asked. This movie is a thoughtful, poignant and brutally honest examination of the human experience in the face of extreme adversity.The overall theme boils down to ""Don't give up hope"" and that the evidence of that hope is the focusing of one's will into a sheer, unstoppable weapon for change. Andy is a wonderfully rounded out and active protagonist who you root for even before you know him well.This movie has been played repeatedly on cable, but do yourself a favor and watch the unedited version. Bring tissue in case dirt gets in your eye."	10
 A powerful drama	A powerful drama that reminds us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning.Many of the most powerful stories are the soulful ones that teach us not to despair, not to be swamped by sorrow. They remind us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion which can give our lives substance and meaning. Writer and director Frank Darabont draws out strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins as soulmates who support each other while doing hard time. Red sees hope as a dangerous thing that can drive a man insane, but Andy believes it is fuel that keeps one going against all odds. The Shawshank Redemption is a jubilant tribute to hope as an essential quality of soul	9
 Good feeling movie	It is a simple film, good feeling, mind blowing and satisfied.Must watch	9
 !!!!!	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them.

I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever"	10

 Amazing	One of the best story lines in movie history. Morgan Freeman was probably one of the only few that could of gave the best narrations for this film. This emotional and impactful film will have you remembering famous lines and scenes.	10
 this is the best		10
 He shines when it is his time to go back	"He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	10
 A solid Stephen King adaptation	Personally I do not think this title deserves a spot on the first place of the top 250 movies list, but it was an enjoyable feel good movie nonetheless.	7
 amazing amazing	Sueperb fantastic, perfect screenplay, prefect direction, all actors performed very well, i am glad to see this film and amazed	9
 A Motivational movie	Those who fed up with their life once saw this movie may their motivation can be rejuvenate.	6
 review summary	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	7
 What it feels to be Human again	"When the VOICE of the Century - ""Morgan Freeman"" is narrating a feel good story, that digs out all the hidden emotions inside of you, you only wonder, WOULD HOLLYWOOD Ever make a movie like this again !!!"	10
 Fantastic movie	One of a kind, great watch, this movie will withstand the sands of time until it is no more.Great performance and fantastic lines, there has not been a movie like this before and never will be.	10
 Hope	I liked this movie, so inspiringmany quotes I've written from it	9
 Good movie	A very touching movie that will make see things in whole. .new outlook on life	6
 US Lawyer is sent to Shawshank prison for life, charts his experiences, friendships and influences on the prison whilst maintaining his innocence.	This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form.The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.	8
 perfect film	I very like this film because flashback to my life at the home wite my girlsfrend	10
 wow what a film	That was ggreat. I really liked all of it. Really hit the haertstrings	9
 It deserves its ranking, almost	"This is without doubt one of the best movies! And what makes it great is also what makes me somewhat ""unhappy"" with this film. This is a film best enjoyed the very first time you watch it."	9

 The Meaning of a Cinematic Masterpiece		10
 Masterpiece	This is a masterpiece. Great movie and plot. Very deep and well written characters	10
 The bestest crime drama movie ever	Don't waste your time reading this review and go watch the movie	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"".The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."	10
 One of the most ive watched movies !	It dont matter how many times i watch and i still feel like its the first time im watching :) just great! I think most of you knows what i mean by that. Great by means	10
 no fear	This movie has a grea message.tim robbins gave one of the greatest performance ever.	6
 Morgan Freeman!	The best lovie ever made! Morgan Freeman forever. A+++++++++	10
 Amazingly structured and captivating.	One of film industries classics and one that you can watch repeatedly.I admit I have watched Shawshank over 50 times and it is definitely a masterpiece.Every actor has a defined fantastic role and I have great respect for the producers who picked the actors for their specific roles.Would have been nice to see a Shawshank 2	10
 What a classic!!!	Brilliant movie,I'm so glad I can see on a big screen at cinema. Marvellous and how interesting,also the cast just a fab . Highly recommended to watch	10
 One of the Greatest Films Ever Made	This is by far the best character drama I have seen. The acting is believable and powerful, the shots are perfectly framed, the story is interesting and keeps you hooked, and the comedy, while in short supply, is appropriately dark. Andy Dufresne is a relatable protagonist, and thus it is easy to connect with his struggles, and understand how he feels about being thrown into the life of a convicted criminal. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give us incredible performances, along with everyone else in the movie. On top of that, the ending is one of the best ever put on screen. I would recommend this film to everyone who likes the industry, and consider it a must-see cinematic classic.	10
 Amazing movie	Awesome movie. I like the story and all characters and also the technical aspects.	10
 This movie is why I wanna become a actor	This great word is spoken in this movie the facts of life and all I'm watching again great movie the Shawshank redemption is the best movies	9
 Great.	One the All time greats! I watch this movie every time it's on. Luv Morgan Freeman. Must See!	9
 Captivates	Shawshank captivates human emotion on a deep level. The characters are believable and deep, the story is immersive and captivating, and it is long enough to truly paint a canvass. The performances are powerful and true. I do believe this to be one of the ten to fifteen truly timeless pieces that will never age. It is amazing.Definitely own it.	10
 A Masterpiece In My Eye	One of the best movies with prison theme I've ever seen. It is one of the films that should be watched. I wish we could watch high-quality productions like the Captivity. I thank everyone who contributed to the film.	9
 The best	This film deserves to be at the top,of the list. Career defining roles for Robbins and Freeman. Sometimes the movies that stand the test of time won't win the biggest awards but gain the loyalty of fans for generations. This will be one of them.	10

 Unbeatable	Not in words to describe Shawshank redemption.....	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is a marvelous story about friendship, salvation and desperation!	"The Shawshank Redemption is easily my favorite Drama movie ever. It is beautifully written and the acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing and flawless. This was my first time watching this movie and I absolutely loved it. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.I found it surprising that Andy escaped Shawshank prison. I thought that he would get parole just like Brooks did, but I was wrong. The amount of time he spent planning his escape was undeniable and fascinating. Andy never lost hope. ""Hope can make a man insane"" is a powerful quote said by Red, but was quickly contradicted by Andy who wrote in his letter for his pal Red that ""Hope is a good thing.""After 40 years in Shawshank prison, Red finally was released. He realized that he has nothing in the outside world and misses his friend Andy. However, he did not commit suicide unlike Brooks, but honored the promise he made to Andy. Andy's quote ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" stayed in Red's head and motivated him to travel to Mexico and see Andy.The iconic shot of Andy with stretched arms and closed eyes in the rain was brilliant and symbolizes freedom. After 19 years in Shawshank prison he escaped and is finally free to do whatever his heart desires.The Shawshank Redemption is empowering and leaves the audience covered in thoughts about the strong message behind the movie. The message the movie conveys is that one should never give up and always have hope.I loved how the movie referenced the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" by Alexandre Dumas. While not having the exact same plot, the Shawshank Redemption and the Count of Monte Cristo both share similar aspects. For instance, in both the movie and book the main character escapes from prison.To conclude, this is by far my all time favorite drama movie and understand why it is the top rated movie on IMDB despite being a box office disappointment. For those who have not watched it, I recommend it due to the powerful friendship between Red and Andy. The Shawshank Redemption is in many ways an all time classic movie."	10
 A Masterpiece	The Best Film in Top 250 is One of the Great Films I've ever Seen in this Masterpiece you can find a way for life crisis The Shawshank redemption is a film for Relaxing especially end of it when red came to Andy I Think this sense even better than red's Escape but why many of world people love the film? I Think everyone can enjoy it length of film is 142 mins maybe more for a film with no action sense but I think no one end of it but a question for me is why darabont can't make masterpieces like it and green mile rhythm of movie is an important thing for addressed in the Shawshank redemption rhythm don't tire you and characters are not superstars with more ability than a human Andy could find a way for escape because he was an innocent man and don't kill his wife and prison is a character in this film like green mile maybe you loved like or hate this movie but I am one of the fans of darabont's masterpiece	9
 The best film I have ever seen	I first wathed this movie at 2018. Before that I read many reviewes about this movie. There were both positive and negative. But most of them were positive. Then, when I saw the trailer of film on TV, I decided to see that. So, I saw film and was amazed. Why I havent seen this masterpiece before.Start over. Shawshank Redemption is ideal film. Ideal cast, ideal plot, all what I saw in film was ideal. I cant understand people who dont like film, Is it possible to hate this ? Who knows ?I would recommend you this film, If you still dont see. Bot I am sure you have seen. (I KNOW MY LEXICON IS TOO BAD. IT IS BECOUSE I AM KAZAKH(DONT JUDGE STRICTLY)TANKS)))))	10
 A very rare gem	As someone who loves great movies, I must say this is my first review only because this film deserves every accolade it has received and will receive throughout the years....it is a rare priceless gem, a shining example of film perfection...I don't think I will ever see such a great film ever again in my lifetime. Everything comes together flawlessly in the movie, the actors, the plot, the direction, the cinematography, all of it producing a film for the ages....if Stephen King never writes another word, he and director Frank Darabont have given the world an amazing gift in this film...A sincere thank you just doesn't seem enough but you have my undying gratitude for this movie.	10
 Mr. Darabont ?? I'll pay more!!	This may be decades behind. But after watching this for the 159th time on a censored station, is this the greatest movie ever, period, as well as the one movie you beg for just 5 more minutes of screen. The fade out from the oceanside was perfect. Yet Frank. Just show them playing chess on the boat. Not sure bout all the pieces. Who cares. We would cry with every chess move and surely every drink to freedom. But sure that's what happened anyway.	10
 AWESOME MOVIE	I ALWAYS WATCH IT AND IT CAME TO SLEEP I WAKE HAVING DREAMS ABOUT THE MOVIE LAST NIGHT AND NOT ONLT I WAS IN IT MAKING MY OWN DECSIONS IT GAVE ME ROOM TO INVENT MY OWN PERSON	10
 Good stories are good movies	"Before watching this movie , I red the script and it was as good as the movie which I watched 1 year after it . I now believe ""Alfred Hitchcock"" was right by bringing this fact that "" any good movie has 3 things . A good scrip , a good script and a good script """	10
 the best	Well balanced and well played by the actors of all the film best prison break	10
 Timeless	I've seen this dozens of times, it still moves me. Aside from the compelling characters and story, I've come to appreciate the strong cinematic timing and the narration by Freeman.I have a feeling I'll never be done enjoying this film.	10
 Still the best!	I've seen this movie over 10 times now and it only gets better and deeper! Thank you Frank.D and Mr. King for creating this wonderful story and movie!Best of all time	10
 Undeserving of this placing	This film's acting and attempted realism is most likely the sole reason this film is ranked so highly on the list. The two main roles are good at conveying the proper human emotions during the right scenes. It may be just a personal disliking of the plot itself, but the whole film feels rather drug out, as if the director was trying to look for thing to add in. This movie could have been a lot better if parts were cut from the finished product overall it just feels desperatley stretched.	8
 The movie	This is the movie every director will be jelous for his entire life what more can I say	10
 Ofcourse the best film I have ever seen.	Almost perfect.Every performer has choosen right.An absorbing story and a great director of photography.Great lessons for life.If you only have the chance to watch a movie just watch this one. You will never forget this taste.	10

 best movie i have ever seen	The shawshank redemption is my favorite movie of all time.it deserves to be the highest ranked movie and it will probably be forever.great story, great directing, great actors.this movie hits every emotion possible.it taught me that hope can help everyone to keep going.well done. 10 out of 10	10
 Excellent movie!	Excellent Movie! A must see for everyone! This is one of the best movies you can see even though it's from 1994 (old, but gold)!	9
 Time, patience & loyalty	There is life & humor in it, and warmth in the friendship. There is even excitement & suspense, although not when we expect it. Mostly Its about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. Its perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe thats part of the idea to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.	10
 Overrated	Too overrated. The only thing going on is: he tried to escape prison. And then what?	6
 The Shawshank Redemption	This movie really helped me think about how the good and bad of humanity can be found in all people. Through the relationships forged and tested, we see how circumstances can influence a person's destiny.	9
 Story about perseverance	One of the best stories about perseverance and friendship in times of despair. A must watch.	10
 Must watch for everyone	Hats off to director and team. Every scene, dialogue can't be missed.	10

 Guter Film den man gesehen haben MUSS!	Einer meiner Top Lieblingsfilmen.Sehr Spannend gemacht, einfach toll....	10
 Movie Defeats The Book!!!!!	As an omnivorous reader movies are always second to books to me. I believe....movie can never defeat the book because while reading book we use our own imagination....and movie narrows down the imagination.....it only allows us to see how the director has imagined the book.	9

 believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to	"Therefore, in defense of both Tolkien (whom some on this website have maligned) and Jackson (whom many have maligned), I forward that both are imaginative creators in their own right, with different and completely acceptable offerings to the world. Those who cannot tolerate either for ""mediocre writing"" or ""atrocious film-making"" should offer forth their literary or cinematic offspring instead of cunningly-worded diatribes of their deep dissatisfaction with all that does not conform to their inner reality. Then, we few who believe in and trust the creative ability of all will be able to see how those critical inner realities (so authoritative in exposition) match up with the rest of our perceptions."	9
 Awesome	When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and a violent masked villain (Tom Hardy).	8
 best movie	A thumpingly good ode to friendship hope wit wiles and wisdom	10
 The Gold Standard	The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film. One of the reasons why I got into filmmaking. It's an inspiration and should be required viewing for any filmmaker.	10
 not a 10-point film	Nice movie but a bit over-rated for top ten. film about two imprisoned men and their story. there isn't any intresting thing that will be up to top film.	8
 Best movie about prison	Great movie and absolutely best movie about prison but i think this movie isn't the best movie of all time.	8
 Must watch	One of the all time great movies. Its a must watch.	10

 Watch it, outstanding characters and plot	Anything by Stephen King has to get your attention. This movie about a fellow who finds his way to prison after a job in banking. The experiences of prison life and the characters who interact with him make this movie great. This award winning movie is worth your time.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	Love this movie Morgan Freeman was a brilliant actor in this movie	10
 Great. Absolutely Great.	See it over and over again!Another one I watch every time it's on.	10

 Best movie about prisons	Best movie about prisons because shows how really is in 9/10.	8
 Muy bien	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 The Best	One of the best or I should say, Best of best movie.	10
 Best movie ever	I could watch The Shawshank Redemption, 10 times in the row... over and over again! OMG, what a movie!!!	10
 A perfect movie	Story telling at its finest. A movie that makes you care about its characters and what happens to them makes this truly a movie to love. It's also a movie that everyone can watch and enjoy, not just a subset of viewers. If you've not watched this classic movie you're doing yourself a disservice. Perfect in every way possible.	10
 Melodramatic...Feeling Rehabilitated	One of the finest adaptations of Stephen King's novels, par or even beyond 'Stand By Me'. The two and half hours spent for this movie was totally worth it. The movie was a box office bomb, mainly due to other magnificent movies like Tom Hank's 'Forrest Gump' which were out at the same time. But the movie was a great success in home video, breaking records for the most rented video. No wonder it has a magnus IMdB rating of 9.3 and tops the list of 'The most rated IMdB titles'. This is the best work of Frank Darabont and he was successful in adapting the novel well. Even after two decades,this movie is still considered as one of the best movies ever made by senior critics.The movie takes you to the prison life of Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding(Morgan Freeman) and Andrew Dufrsene(Tim Robbins). Andy is serving a life sentence for a murder charge of his wife which the prosecution says he did after he caught his wife on bed with some golf pro. He befriends Red in the prison and he gains respect of his fellow prison mates and the guards through his unique behavior. The corrupt jail warden Mr. Norton(Bob Gunton) makes use of Andy's financial skills to earn thousands of dollars. Andy decided that he had been there for such a long time and need to get out of there when Norton and Capt. Hadley(Clancy Brown) glooms his last ray of hope of being free from the charges when they murder Tommy(Gil Bellows) who claimed that he know the real one who committed the crime for which Andy was serving his sentence. Not only that he break out of the prison, he also make the warden and captain pay for what they did. Andy also took all the money which was deposited at the bank which belonged to Norton as all the details of the fake account holder were set by him only.The movie shows the limits of human endurance. The film's firm foundation is its meticulously chiseled screenplay. Thomas Newman's exquisite music scores are deep and takes us to another realm. With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. You can undoubtedly say you saw some of the most convincing performances you could witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, the supporting artists too were not any behind. Brooks Hatlen played by the veteran James Whitmore is just an example. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations.I have lost count on how many times I saw this movie and I have recommended it to many of my friends. None said they would give a rating below 8. I am a huge fan of Stephen King's adapted works and loved 'Stand By Me', 'Cujo', 'It', etc. But this one is beyond description.	10
 An amazing movie...	...with a powerful message. watched it several times.	10
 Amazing Movie. Must Watch	Amazing Movie. Must Watch. Very Well Made and it keeps u glued to ur screen	9

 A must watch film	Brilliant script and amazing film line.Along with the wonderful actors, the direction of the film is a+.	10
 Nice movie ,extroordinary photography and graphics	Nice movie ,extroordinary photography and graphics	10
 Good movie!	This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!	7
 perfect	The film is perfect. I would recommend it to everyone	10
 Hope is good thing.	One sentence:Remember Red, hope is good thing, may be the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.	10

 The Best	The Best of the best. Flawless script. Motivating. Just amazing.	10
 MASTERPIECE	"Best movie ever made. The plot of the movie is so good it impressed me to watch it over and over again. Every time I watch, it gives me utmost satisfaction. I recommend everyone who hasn't watched this movie to watch it without any second thought. The acting, directing, screenplay and the story line is out of this world that is why I say this is a ""MASTERPIECE"" ever made."	9
 The Shawshank Redemption after 25 years	A really good constructed film with fine characters and an amazing story! Strong and powerful message, astonishing performance of the actors, wonderful lesson.	10
 awesome and perfect	I can say without any doubt this movie is one of the greatest movies of all time . in many thing story acting music camera ,light control and evry 7 art make movie .but for the people don't understand it i can say only a word to them and that word is be be patient and see everything and feel and realise anything you can see,hear,feel,logic or sentimental dos not matter just do it.	10
 Objectively the best movie ever made...	"In my subjective opinion, Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best movie and my personal favorite... But this movie, this movie is just soooo good... While it is not my favorite movie, it deserves the title of ""Best movie of all time""...It's never Boring, the characters are fun and relatable, and the motivations are just AMAZING!This movie is worth a watch, any time"	10
 Eye Opening	It truly gives you a perspective of the people at the other side of the world. Makes you see how one feels to what they have experienced throughout their journey. Great use of story telling to touch one's hearts.	9
 Best prison movie of all time!	It is a movie that catches your attention from start to end. Besides the great storytelling, what I most love about this one is the great cast with strong performances and the fact that the main character is indeed intelligent. He is very smart along the movie, so clever most of us didn´t see his plan coming. Every character in the film has a very defined personality and adds to the plot. The ending is great.	10
 Final Verdict	An amazing plot with beautiful performances by actors of a different class. I strongly feel the music should have been more driven. This movie really deserved an iconic soundtrack. Nevertheless, everything else is exceptionally to-die-for stuff.	10
 review	Its one of the best movie i have ever watched .	8
 The Shawshank Redemption	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.	10
 Amazing	This movie is from other world, nothing more to say	10
 most gripping story	This movie is my most favorite due to its gripping plot and beautiful dialogues and amazing performances by the castHighly highly recommended	10
 Yesyes	Oh yes hahaahha yes oh yes i know wtf yes yes Hzhshwisjsxhajwjajaaoakzhzhahahaba shashshxhsjalaosjzhzHs sjsjsjsjaksjxhaajwozksjs sjsjxjxjwkwjsjdjsjdsjsjsjiyifjyfjfhtdhtdjyfkugiy jycjyfhtdgrshyfjugkhvkuvujjhchtxht jhcjtxhtxhfxhgcjycjycjyyhc	10
 An oldschool masterpiece	I come back to that movie various times in my life, always when in need of a emotional cheer up. Its worth the watch.	8
 such a good story	You know the story of this movie is one of the best stories I have ever seen and the actors , they really feel what character are they playing the rules and else.the way that play the movie you feel what they are feeling like happiness anxious or other things	9
 best movie ever	If you die before watch that this means you're in full of sin	9
 life is begin	Thats movie change a lot of things in mylife, my oppinion and behave. realy so real and feeling	9
 excellent	How am i supposed to describe this absolutely fantastic and unbelievable film in words? I don't know. But I'll give it a shot. Here goes.This movie is just bloody , brilliant, fantastic, unbelievable, not a thing wrong with it, shocking (in a good way), heck, pretty much every single good comment word you can think of.	10
 SUPERB	I like it so beautiful movie this movie graphics is amazing	10
 good film	Good film. I will try view this. It's retro film, which i fill good.	10
 One of the best movies ever made	I saw this movie for the first time when I was 17 or 18 years old on VHS :) The nineties surely produced some of my favorite movies, like Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption.This movie is too good to be correctly reviewed because it's very hard to explain in words all the feelings that the prison story of Andy Dufresne sends to you, but at the end you can feel this movie is an all time classic.All characters have stellar performances specially by the 2 main characters, portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, and you are left with the ambiguity of Andy's verdict, which makes people wonder what really happened and discuss about it.The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece that cannot be missed.	10
 One of the Best Movie in Hollywood	I loved the movie so much. Direction is fabulous, Action is superb as well.	10
 Re watch over and over	If it's on.....I'm watching it. Regardless of where it is in the movie	9
 A classic everyone should watch	One of the few cases of the movie being better than the book in my opinion. An absolute classic that never gets old.	9
 One of the best movies I've ever seen	It has a deep story.Well chosen cast.Can imagine, that it's based on a true story.I wouldn't recommend it to younger (2000's) generation.	10

 excited - i don't believed	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	9
 Awesome	Considering the time movie was shot, the acting, storyline and plot twists, this movie is a masterpiece.A must watch movie which will fulfill your expectations.Movie is 85% misery and 15% happiness. Dialogues are good. Background score hits at right place.Watch till the end.	10
 Amazing	Absolutely amazing movie, watching this every year for the growing hope inside me.	10
 A great gem of the seventh art	It's a moving story, with a profound message that allows us to be aware of the injustices that are experienced in the penitentiary system, but also goes further, encompassing the development of human nature, of the struggle when one has the impression of that there is no hope, of the redemption of life after losing everything.As other comments have already said, it is a film that should be recommended as an antidepressant by therapists, and that everyone should see more than once in their lives.	10
 Masterpiece!	Best movie I have ever seen in my life.It will keep you mesmerized the entire duration and all you wish is to see more. Great acting and a interesting story. Highly recommended.	10
 I love this movie	Last (ending) scene gets goosebumps. love it!Morgan freeman is amazing actor!	9
 Best From Hollywood Side	Frank is really genius person. he always thought out of the box and make it awesome to his viewers	10
 All time best	"I have not seen any better movie than this in my my life. It's so heart touching script and the acting ohh my god it's fantastic. The direction the music screenplay all is exceptionally good. My all time favourite.. I want to watch this movie again and again to get motivated. ""Hope is the best of things"""	10
 Touching prison story	I'm gonna start like this: The movie touched me and I think it is great, but it does have flaws.First off: Good production, well casted and great acting, one of Freeman's best roles and setting, camera, costumes, props etc. have a high standard.I think the plot was good, but for the most part predictable, nothing surprised me, still a smart and touching prison story.Yet I caught myself doubting some parts of the happenings and sometimes the production looked too slick.I don't think it's a 10 since there are small things I would've done differently, giving it 9/10 since it's still a great movie.	9
 one of the best	Best movie everchanges your lifealways re-watching ithope this comes on $k	10
 Deserves all stars	Amazing movie You can't get what is going to happen next	10
 /	"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every"	10
 Best movie ever!	I believe this is the best movie ever made! Direction, action, story, everything is great. Many congrats.	10
 Best Film Ever	It's the best film I've ever seen, i watched it with no one else, and i think it should been viewed alone.	10
" Its a good story thats scream ""Never give up!"""	It a really beautifull, almost life story of everyone. Life is a list of black and white stripes, so don't forget changes is coming	10
 Film Liquet on The Shawshank Redemption		9
 Classic film that never seems to age	24 years old and this film never seems to get old. Each time I watch it, it just gets better and better. There is nothing more I need to say.	
 A must watch	This is not just a great movie, is a must watch! The movie is a classic, it brings many truly dramatic moments, with some real life experiences and everything is just in the right place. As said, a must watch!	10
 Best movie for my darkest time	He made me get through the darkest days of my life, and keep moving forwar.	10
 Shawshank Redemption(1994)	This is one of the best dramatic-Mysterious Film of the Century.The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank DarabontIt tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne,who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife & her lover,despite his claims of innocence.This Movie Filmed the Reality of a Murderer's life inside the Prison.The Movie Seeds Excitment in Viewer & some Mysterious Moments Twist's the Normal Flow of the Movie and brought changes in his life.Good movieMust WatchI will Give 7.5/10🌟🌟🌟🌟	7

 am	Odlican!baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa	10
 Just watch. Sometimes you will think about it and want to watch 1 more time :D	It's Perfect. about man's dream, brother hood, lively hood and humand kind	
 A MUST WATCH POSITIVE MOVIE!!	Such a nice movie it is.Very thought provoking. It taught and gave a lot of HOPE.Shown the beauty of FRIENDSHIP.And most of all proved that THE RESULT OF HARD WORK IS ALWAYS SWEET.	10
 What a guy!	The reason I'd give this movie 10/10 is because of this brilliant character, Dufresne, who is a quiet and deep thinker. His pondering, resonating silence is felt through the film through Tim Robbins' amazing talent, and the viewer falls in love with him almost at once.The beautiful, well drawn out character is one of my strongest fictional role models.	10
 A truly amazing movie	This is Stephen King's greatest adaptation of all time. The Shining is a close second. This movie's message is absolutely incredible and Tim Robbins gave his greatest performance to date and it is one of Morgan Freeman's best performances. It shocks me that metacritic gave this movie a 80 but I can see why people don't like this movie but I adore this movie. Acting-10/10 Plot 9/10 reason I have seen a better plot in movies. Ending-10/10 when Red sees Andy in that place he always wanted to go to and starts talking about hope is a phenomenal acting job and one of the best acting scenes I have ever seen. This movie is a 9.3/10	9
 great life	We all need to face difficulties in our life.It's a struggling make us strong.	10
 Perfect artwork	Life is full of surprises. and don't give up.Life is full of surprises. and don't give up.Life is full of surprises. and don't give up.Life is full of surprises. and don't give up.Life is full of surprises. and don't give up.	10

 MY FIRST REVIEW @IMDB	Redemption of freedom.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 best best best	Good cinema very good people ... people and world life gravity selectionfavor will win	10
 Hope of liberation	Omg what a absolute wonderful movie. Very well written.	10
 Incredible	Considering the fact that The Shawshank Redemption is #1 on IMDb, and also considering that it has been drooled upon by so many people over the years, I had high hopes. I've seen it a few times now, I first saw it when I was 13. No issues with the storytelling or character development, but just not as perfect as people say. Still a magnificent film!	9
 Fab	Great movie. Seen it 50 times easily. Recommended.	9
 Simply one of the best prison drama films!	Sure, during it's initial release in 1994 it didn't match the revenue or profits of aneo-noir genre film like Pulp Fiction, which was released during the same timeline.Although Pulp Fiction is one of my all time favorites this movie definitely is as well. Definitely not a comedy in the slightest however.	10
 To all a must watch	Best movie to watch. Rent it and you want be disappointed at all. Seen it over ten times	10
 The Shawshank Redemption(1994)	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	10

 Good but shouldn't expect too much	Good overall definitely but I don't think one should expect too much. Still i would recommend it.	8
 One of the best movies I've watched	It is a must see movie! What makes this movie of of the best, in my opinion, it is the message it sends.	10
 Freedom, good and evil, self-realization - a timeless theme	First of all, as I said above, the film depicts some timeless themes. As long as someone exists, as long as people still exist in the social structure in the form of independent individuals, then these themes will never be outdated and will always be worth pondering and discussing.Moreover, the film was completed in the 1990s, and the old shooting and performance techniques were completely eliminated at the time. So there is no ubiquitous deliberate and artificial in the old movie. It looks natural and convincing as a whole - although it must obviously be classified as a romantic genre.	9
 Mind Blown	This was one of the film I have ever seen since a long time in ages.Till now it is on of the best your you will ever see in hollywood cinema as it really really connects with audience and everybody life.	10

 Best movie in my list.	The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. 10/10	10
 The Shawnshank Redemption	This movie was one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. I've never been a fan of really long movies but this movie made me think for a long time.

Go ahead, watch it.	10

 The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	10
 Shame on you if you have yet to see this masterpiece!!	From opening scene.. to the very last scene this movie is phenomenal.	10
 One of the best movies you can see	Without a doubt I would consider this movie one of the best that I have seen and I watch it every so often and no matter how many times I watch it I get the same experience, I cant really say that about really any other movie, this movie is well worth the watch, in my opinion. It has one of the most satisfying climaxes in cinema history as well which is a great plus.	9
 Brilliant prison story.	The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time.The movie keeps the viewer thrilled and excited, because in every minute, something could happen. The dialog is good, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both great actors, shows and outstanding play.A brilliant movie. My rating 8/10	8
 Amazing	Amazing Movie ..................urehfrueyhyufg7trefgc6tfgec7ewgc78	9
 Beauty Is Felt, Not Said By Words	I have made a point of watching IMDb Top 250 Movies for quite some time. Wasn't aware of such a list, until I stumbled across IMDb & realised I had seen all of Top 50 (Almost) while some movies remaining. But, I see why Shawshank Redemption is #1.Writing review about the movie would be an injustice. The movie shows Human Relationship at its core, when opened to its core upon extreme adversaries. Watch this movie, not because it's #1 in IMDb Rating but because the 240 minutes would be the moments to reflect your whole life on.	10
 Shawshank	Brilliant movie. It's about friendship that develops in a prison environment.	10
 One of the best films I've ever seen	An amazing story that caughts you from first minute.	10

 Good Movie - Highly Overrated	"Good Movie, Good Film, Good Actors, Good Director, Good Crew all around. Highly overrated - this does not meen that this is s bad movie. - I just think, personally, that ""No Country for Old Men"" by the Coen Brothers is better... I recommend this movie - it's good, Good Movie, Good Film, Good Actors, Good Director, Good Crew all around!"	8
 good	Really good movie. Intense story and great acting. Intemporal and a true story about redemption and courage.	10
 This is the Muhammad Ali of movies!	The Shawshank Redemption is to movie history whatMuhammad Ali was for boxing, GOAT!Yeah, I get it, some people mention the cheesy end but how could it end any different?2 1/2 hours to then watch Andy pass away?Come on.Perfect movie, perfect actors, just PERFECT!	10

 Breathtaking.	To everyone who is asking why this movie is this highly rated: the story, direction, the casting, everything is amazing. It is absolutely beautiful and tells a unique story. Adapted from Stephen King's novel (which I love), this movie tells you the struggles and lives of men in prison and their life after. I suggest everyone to watch it. :)	9

 Fantastic	Absolutely fantastic film from start to finish, watched it to dress of times and still gets better every time i watch it	10
 Filmmaking Redemption	"It's hard to find a decent picture nowadays. Our screens are polluted by the filthy and unimaginative trash that we in the modern age, and ages of recent late, call remakes, reimaginings, and, if you're referencing the gaming industry, remasters. But here is a film that couldn't in any way be reimagined, remade, or remastered. As well, films based on books, in my opinion, often fail to convey the thoroughness and whole-heartedness of the written word. But here is a film that [I'd say] is the exception.Here is a film whose actors portray their characters with such imagination of their own that it's hard not to like them and relate to them. You may think that Tim Robbins, wearing that sneaky grin and sometimes straight face throughout the film, is a lifeless individual, but in reality, it's that muck-eatin grin he dons on occassion that let's you know, yeah this guys up to something. I knew it from the moment Andy Dufraine presented a simple exploit to the prison guard, Byron Hadley, allowing him to could keep his money instead of having it taken by the IRS, those bloodsuckers. In the days following, as Andy watched his ""co-workers"" sip cold beers, he simply sat there, grinning facade, basking in the glory of his deviousness and the formation of what would become his master escape plan.It's the simple things like that that made this film such a pleasurable viewing experience for me. The minute successes and acts of kindness and the subsequent feeling of pride and accomplishment from the two main characters gave me, in a way, my very own sense of accomplishment.This is a rare feat. It's difficult to create a film that actually allows the viewer to feel as if they are living the life of the character, in whatever moment of said character's life said film is taking place in. By the end of the movie, I had a renewed feeling. The only other time I can recall having this reaction is when I saw The Silver Linings Playbook (2012), another excellent and good-feeling film in which the main character undergoes a traumatic experience and we see his continued suffering, post incident. I felt as though I was with him through every moment of his struggles.In conclusion, and this seems to have become the theme of my review, it's thr simplest things that give this film its great vibe, and compells me to continue watching all the way through to that very last scene in which Andy and Red (Morgan Freeman) share a distantly viewed hug alongside the lightly rolling waves of the Pacific. Simple, yet beautiful, and heartwarming."	10
 I really good movie	Well, talk about humble beginnings. You can take so much from this movie. And know at the end, he came out on top, in so many ways.	10
 like	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 Good	"I'm very like this ""The Shawshank Redemption""! The or or hints"	9
" ""Geology is the study of pressure and time. That's all it takes, really. Pressure... and time. That and the big goddamn poster."""		10
 Simply Amazing	All time favorite and a classic movie to watch. No wounder it is on top of the IMDB all-time best, slow at the beginning the movie develops into something mesmerizing.I can only wounder what producers and director(s) went through in the making of this movie.	10
 The best movie for ever!	This is the best movie I have ever watched and advise everyone to watch! Hope and there is nothing else	10
 One of my favorite movies	One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous!	9
 Legend	A film about hope. It is definitely one of the greatest prison films of all time. The movie delivers great messages and displays concepts, like the concept of justice, very well. Freeman and Robbins both deliver great performances, and both portray seemingly likable characters. This film is just very well written and just overall an excellent production.	8
 the best movie	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	9
 Masterpieces	A perfect fiction flawless acting is a film that leaves a significant mark on every person's life.	10
 A must watch!!	I got lost for words. Strongly recommend this movie	9
 Doesn't get any better!!!	Thank you Stephen King!!!!####!!!! !!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!###!!!!!	10
 An enternal masterpiece	Watch it again.. when you feel down or need an uplift. This movie shows how a movie can motivate others life.. it's the ultimate example that proves movie is the best and unperishable medium to perform literatures	10

 Top movie made by Hollywood	This movie i watch many time, and every time I see it very motivated	10
 Simply amazing. The absolute GREATEST movie of all time.	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 Amazing movie	This movie will make you think in so many ways. It's so good! Such a great story, great acting, great directing, the list goes on.	10
 Excellent!	One of my all time favorite movies. At first I thought this was going to be a regular life in prison documentary. It was so much more! It showed how Andy (main character) was innocent and held out hope to escape. The main characters are played well, the set is great. Characters are likeable. Acting is great and the plot was classic as well. His escape in the end was what made me the happiest, seeing Red and Andy reunite!	10
 fear can hold u prisoner hope can set you free	This movie is something i cant explain to new comers ,has lots of great quotes ever1; some birds aren't meant to be caged,their feathers are just too bright2. get busy living get busy dying3. brook was here,so was Red	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	I highly enjoy this movie. and i hope this movie is enjoyable to every one.	10
 Storytelling at Best......	It touched my heart it fullfilled my heart with all type of emotions you can find sadness anger depressing happiness excitement it is very directed with perfectism with proper editing screenplay and music is what makes this movie special .It brilliantly potrays the idea power of hope this all movie is about hope if you are a prisoner only hope will save you so you damn have hope in you.The dialougesbetween main characters is special seeing their bond grow break again grow by meeting a friend after long time with consent of hope if you watch this movie carefully you will find this movie 's power on your mind.As Andy Dufrene said __ fear can hold you prisoner but hope can set you free..............	10

 One of my all time top 5	As a high school teacher and coach for the past 23 years, many films have come and gone in various levels of popularity. Whenever teenagers ask about movies, favorite movies, etc, Shawshank is ALWAYS in my top 5 of what they must see.	10
 Wonderful	"Awesome movie""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 Highly Overrated But Still Good		10
 Fun to watch	Every scene, every character, ever word was magnific. I really spent time time watching a movie like this, a calm, happy ending.Showed how looked like the life on the prison in the 50th. The religion in there it was very strong to follow.The main character, Andy, is used by the director, to laundry the money, but without no one knowing Andy scammed the money and scaped in a wonderful way.Really enjoyd watching, this movie will enter in my fav list.	10
 A Classic I Can Watch A Million Times.	An amazing piece of cinematic history love every second of this movie could watch it a million times what a classic.	10

 Maybe one of my favorite movies of all time	This is without a doubt one of kings best movies and to be honest with there isn't much to be said except that you need to watch it to get why it is so good. I wouldn't recommend it if you don't like dramas or slower movies, but other than that definitely give it a try. My only hope is that they don't give it a remake like the rest of king's films.	9
 All-time favourite		10

 One of Most Best Takes on a Classic King Novel	"The movie is all seemingly upfront.... A man named Andy DuFresne (Tim Robbins) is in court for killing his Wife and her Lover, He is found guilty and sent to Shawshank for the crime. While there he learns that Prison is not what he is accustomed to nor is it easy to ""Get Along"" easy. He does make due and make friends. Spends his years keeping upbeat. But after a SHOCKING REVELATION from Tommy (Gil Bellows) another prisoner brings to the prison from a cell-mate at a former place ANDY Gives up hope. But soon we realize it was all a Time game with a Very Very Smart man who has bides his time well! It is Narrated by Andy's Best Friend on the inside Red (Morgan Freeman) and Told from his perspective of the situation. All around a very great movie."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption was Simply Amazing	Director Frank Darabont arbitrates an amazing and compelling environment of corruption and police brutality within the department of corrections. Just simply astounding performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. This is quite simply a movie every human being alive should watch at least once!	10
 such a classic	Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.	10

 OMG	HOLY JESUS! A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	9
 I Love this film	"I have seen the film several times, we can only say ""there is no better"""	
 Cult Movie and Has a Cool Name	It's a cult movie and this movie has a cool name. This film tells the road to success despite difficulties. I think it's one of the movies to watch.	9
 Mind Blowing	It's a travel through an unexpected but inspiring life.Just watch this movie for first firsr 20 minutes. You could not stop watching it after that till the end. I had seen this movie in my college final year for the first time without any idea what this movie is about and I dare say I tasted a masterpiece in my life. The movie clearly shows us what is life and how to live it through the actors by making them live and so us with them in the prison. I am happy that I watched this movie while I am starting a new life because it gave me the Hope which is the movie is all about.It's not this sad ending movie that they try to make everytime to grab an oscar or something. I can assure you if you watch this movie you would be more motivated and expect to value your life more than you ever had.	10
 A Classic	Whenever I'm in the mood for a classic film I find myself going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. It's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.	10
 like it	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."	7
 Familiar	Fiery time I watched this film I was already familiar with the overall story of the main character wrongfully accused of murder, spending time away from the world, making friends and then escaping. It is the emotion of each connection everyone makes with eachother that has the greatest impact on me everytime I watch it since.	8
 AMAZING	ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING MOVIES WE ´VE SEEN ON THE SCREENS.	9
 Basic	Classic film that can be revisited. I think they should bring the characters back for a reunion and do a sequel.	10
 Fantastic Film	This is an excellent movie, watch it.It's heavily engaging through great pacing, writing and acting as well as well-crafted and interesting characters and circumstances that can end up making you look at certain things in a new light.	10
 Hello	Its amazing if u watch this u will predict this film	10
 The Movie that changed almost everything.	""" The Movie"" that gained much recognization in the late 90s (& still rocking in everyone's favorite movie list) changed everything. I mean, it literally changed almost everyone's prespectives regarding life.Nothing to say about Direction & other relatable things (bc there's nothing to say about it, everything was pitch perfect.)Many filmgoers compared Andrew's story to Messiah (Jesus) changing everyone's life (directly or indirectly that matters to that person) & yeah, they're not wrong. They also said that the movie is actually about Red's belief about friendship, truth about life, dignity, joy, etc.Oh man, I might need more space to write about this movie bc there's so much to say but I don't know how to explain it! Actually, this movie is to experience it & relate to your life. Free from whatever you thought that blocking you to live YOUR life fullest.Best FRICKIN movie ever, Period.PS - There's still some imperfections about this film but please while watching this just focus on the story & it's depth, not it's faulty things."	10
 Excellent	Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent Excellent	10
 Hope!	Life can be scary, and hope can set us free.Whatever you're suffering right now, you believe that everthing's gonna be just fine tomorrow.	10

 best	Just think about freedom just for life and for live	9
 Great	One of the best movies of all time, but what makes all the difference is its slow paced storytelling which adds so much value to the film.	9
 Not a great film, but a beautiful film in every way	"Not a great film, but a beautiful, enjoyable film in every way (and surprisingly entertaining for a prison movie). It's really unfortunate that it ranks at no.1 on imdb, since that stigma will smear it forever. Before the discussion boards closed, about 99 of every 100 topics about it were ""DOESN'T DESERVE No. 1 !!!"" in all caps, of course. And there were very few, almost no discussions about the movie itself, although it's a well-crafted film that deserves analysis.Take the scene, for example, when Andy speaks for the first time during the breakfast scene, and asks ""What was his name?"" about Fat Ass. This simple question, which nobody else thought of asking, sets the tone for the rest of the film in two aspects: One, that Shawshank is the kind of place where you can get out as soon as you come (dead, of course) without anybody even getting to know your name. And two, Andy is no ordinary prisoner. His simple question indicates that he at least has some sympathy for the dead newcomer, he's human, and thoughtful, qualities that have been long erased from the others by incarceration. A chilling quiet falls over the dining table, and heads bow.It's strange that although it was made a mere 25 years ago, it looks like a movie from another century. There is no way this movie would be made the way it is today: there would be some love story between Andy and Red, there would be Asian and Indian prisoners (so as not to offend the Asian and Indian convicts, who may feel they are underrepresented after all) there would somehow be product placement all along, and I'm sure someone would find a way to insert a lesbian relationship in a man's prison movie.This is pure storytelling that's faithful to the original material (only improves it, does not distract anything from it) and great attention to detail. Precise editing that makes the movie run smooth, without skipping a beat (how many people even realize that the movie runs for over 40 minutes more, after Andy's escape?) And of course, wonderful performances by each one of the cast.Too bad that whenever the word ""Shawshank"" is mentioned in movie discussions, it will forever be followed by someone yelling ""NO WAY IT'S NUMBER 1 !!"". It's sad that some people are so obsessed with every movie list out there matching theirs, that out of frustration, they can't even appreciate a good movie when they see one."	10
 This film is overrated	Although many praise the color correction in this film, I did not like it. It is clear why they did this (separation of scenes, etc.), but this did not go well for the film. It was physically difficult for me to watch this film. Regarding the script / actors, there are no complaints. In the film there is a certain tightness, and excessive symbolism in relation to the prison world. Therefore, the estimate 8.	7
 Super Awesome..Be patient and go for it ...	Just love how the movie turns out to be ... i am sure everyone who watches this one is going to be a fan.	9
 Some birds aren't meant to be caged	I will keep my review very short ... If you haven't watched this movie in your 20s, each day from then till you watched it, was wasted! Call yourself 'unlucky' (or stupid if you knew about it).	10
 A very inspiring and moving film...	This is a very moving and inspiring movie that will speak to many different people in many different ways. I feel that everyone will get something useful out of watching this picture. It touches on so many different aspects of friendship, being human and life in general. Watch it with an open mind and see what you gain from the experience. I highly recommend giving this film a chance.	10
 Masterpiece	The greatest movie I' ever seen and it will always going to be.If you want to know what is friendship you should watch this movie	10
 Beyond my expectations.	A beautiful film beyond anything I ever imagined, a master-piece perfectly written and directed by Frank Darabont. If you feel ungrateful for what god has given you, as well as envious, jealous of your entourage, then I recommend you stop whatever silly activity you are doing to sit your ass down and watch this film.A refreshing and awful experience of the harsh life lived in prison by inmates that will teach you the word appreciative.	10
 a must watch	It blows my mind every time i repeat this movie. Many films have been influenced on the story of prison break but this is one of a kind.	10
 pearsonj-89635	This movie was one of the most fabulous movie's I, and you will ever see. This movie is guaranteed to make you cry. Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.	9
 Awesome movie	This classic it's one of the best! Actors, lines, music everything it's perfect about it!! I strongly recomand it for everyone	10
 Beatiful.	This movie will be watched for generations after us. I can review it repeatedly, which I have been doing for many years, really thank you for such a serious approach to the script and shooting. Deserved top 1.	10
 mohammad4437	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	7
 One Word: Patience	The movie is a masterpiece when it comes to the story line. The ending itself gives away a shout of freedom. The cast was spot on movies like Shawshank are a rarity these days. A must watch!	9
 Absolutely Fantastic	This movie well deserves to be the most top rated movie in the history of cinema. Everything about this movie is top-notch. Acting, script, music, etc.It just saddens me that nowadays we don't see movies of this quality anymore.	10
 Competent but overrated	While definitely not a bad movie, I still am flabbergasted at the amount of hype, that The Shawshank Redemption received, long after it's diasappointingly low box office oppening. To me this story about good people that did something bad in their past, or even nothing bad at all, while being at the mercy of some very bad people, who are drunk on the power, they have over the prisoners, comes of as very schmaltzy.This movie had the opportunity to paint it's characters in a grey area, on both sides, but instead tries to bring home the point, that people who are prisoners don't have to be bad at all. While this of course being true, the style in which Tim Robbins' and Morgan Freeman's characters are depicted, feels sugarcoted and unsincere to me. So much so, that I get a feeling of secondhand embarresment, when watching the Shawshank Redemption.	7
 Perfect	Awesome :) Just top pick. Love it.Who didn't saw this now it's the time :)	10
 The best movie	Top 3 Movies I ever watched , includible Morgan Freeman performance .	10
 One of my favorites!	One of my favorites! I love the fact that it's not your typical prison rape movie. Psychological issues that Andy did Fran goes through and his 20 year endeavor is quite entertaining.	10
 Inspirational	The best drama film I have ever seen. The movie is very inspirational and made wonderfully.	10
 Simply masterpiece	Simply awesome, fantastic, optimistic, amazing! Masterpiece of all time..!!	10
 Movie to watch	This is the movie for hope and friendship which drives the movie very thoroughly that very movie must be like that. Truly fan of Stephen King. This movie stands the test of time. Watched the movie many times and still get more excited to watch more. A must watch Marked movie.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	One of the most remarkable films on the American prison world, A memorable music, very good actors, everything is united in this masterpiece. A film that I will remember for a long time.	9
 Nice Movie	Very Nice movie. I really enjoy that movie. And really	10
 As close to perfect as possible.	As a rule I never give films the perfect 10 score but The Shawshank Redemption comes as close to achieving it as possible. The Shawshank Redemption has everything you could ask for in a film. On first viewing it will make you laugh, cry and keep you guessing until the end.A review of this film doesn't have to be longer than three words: Watch this film.	9
 What can I say?	It deserves this rating. It is wonderful :) It is a classic movie which everyone must watch.	10
 A favourite	I love this movie so much. I think I've seen it around 5 times now and I love it every time. There is nothing bad I can really say about it. Even though they don't follow the book to its core I still think it really deserves its number one place here.	10
 Amazing	What can I say that hasn't already been said about this amazing movie.	9
 Good	Nice movie. Very good casting, directing, composing,	8
 ....	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 amazing	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles."	10
 Best Movie	This was very will done. very intense film and will deserved for its awards	10
 good	Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover	7
 Great	Being #1 on the list I expected a lot, and it kind falls short of 10/10 in my eyes. Its a great movie but i expected more.	9
 ...	I couldn't understand why this was considered one of the best films of all times untill I actually watched it...	10
 Kesinlikle izlemelisiniz.	Hayatimda izledigim en güzel filmlerden biri. Harika.	10
 Brilliancy summed up in one movie.	The movie leaves you wondering for hours. This inspires. This is power.	10
 One of the best movies ever	The shawshank redemption is a wonderful film adaptation that is far superior than its original story. With great writing and a fantastic story as well as some of the best acting you will see in film.	10
 Amazing Movie	Its a must watch movie for people who want o know about the german history	10
 !!!	It's a great movie. I'm glad I could see such a movie!	10

 Awesome	It's cool, bro. I like to watch movies about prisons.	9
 A Very Good Film That Does Little Special		8
 Old an' Better	"This movie was made and published 3 years of when i was even born (at 1997). this movie hold it's value in my heart just because it's older than me. im amazed of how good the movie is even when it's put against meta current prison breaking movies and series, such as ""prison break"" which to be fair most of the ideas are ripped of from this movie. The only thing i would've liked to see is more heart touching drama. i mean it's been 30 years for him in that prison and we didn't see him break a tear that whole time for his past or whatever. but instead we saw a cheesy smile in his face sometimes. other than that the movie is hella good and better than most prison movies."	9
 A genius movie	Still one of the best movies to watch over and over again. The beautiful piece of art.	10
 GREAT	Nice job Frank, very nice.And the writers offcourse.	9
 Acute cinema	No comparasion with this film from others.. one of the finest film ever made in the history of cinemA	9
 Wonderful	The movie has taught me patience and at the same time how well you should use your resources. A CLASSIC movie	10
 Hard To Argue Against Being #1	I saw this film back in high school after having read Stephen King's novel. I fought to give this film a nine, but the more I think about it, this is absolutely a ten film. It may not be my personal favourite movie, but I really enjoy it. If I see it playing on television I have to stop and watch. Shawshank Redemption is all about hope which is expressed by Andy. The twists and turns that play out keep you entertained for the entire runtime with a message no one will soon forget. I for one quote the movie all the time. It's absolutely brilliant and the epitome of film structure.	10
 10/10	Excellent movie. I don't watch old movies but this was GOOD.First of all, this movie has meaning. Like this generation movies is about nothing (I don't say that every movie but a lot). Second, actors were great, professional and knew their job.All in all this was best 2 hours of my life :)	10
 A Very Good Film	This film is one of the best films that I've ever watched and offering everyone to watch it as soon as possible.	10
 Wow	Shawshank Redemption has been my number one movie since it came out. I can't find one problem with any of the actors any of the acting the script is wonderful and the buildings are incredible. I find nothing wrong with this movie and all I have to say is good things. One of the best movies I've ever seen.	10
 wow	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	6
 one of the best work of Sir morgan freeman	If you are lover of slow movie with some great actors in it this is your movies guys	9
 Best Movie ever	I love this movie very much , best Decaprio's movie	10
 Great! Great! Great! Film	This is an older film but even today I watch it when they play the reruns. It really shows how innocent people today can get falsely imprisioned. Shows also the violence that can take place in a prison. This is one of my best films.	10
 good movie	The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	10
 A movie with context	Great Movie I can only recomend that you watch it...!	10
 The greatest movie of the history	"Who said Citizen Kane? Who said Casablanca ?. You can keep your mouth shut, because friends, this is the best movie in history.I can't understand how in 1994 a movie (Forrest Gump), also very good but inferior to this one, won several Oscars, including the best film.Also that year was also Pulp Fiction, another that is above Forrest Gump.The fact is ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has it all.A great script, based on the novel of Stephen King (the best novel of him, without a doubt), a relentless direction like that of Daranbont, a spectacular photograph that is accompanied by an impressive soundtrack, the editing is excellent and the performances are all magnificent, highlighting especially the always brilliant Morgan Freeman.My friends, if you really want to see good movies, do not hesitate to see this movie, you will love it, I loved it and it will remain, at least for many years, my favorite movie."	10
 Good one!	Pretty good actually. I liked the Movie as a whole but cannot give it higher due to the fact I've seen better Movies in the past.	8
 What a movie!	It's a movie not to be missed and indeed everyone in the movie plays thier roll very well	9
 Simply fantastic	There's not much to say about this movie. It's a cohesive, spectacular work of art. I don't know how long it takes for a movie of this quality and legacy to surface again, but I reckon it's going to take a while.	9
 An excellent movie - in my top 5 list!	This movie made me laugh and it made me cry, This is probably my 2nd or 3rd favorite movie ranked in my top 5 list. The movie is based in a prison, where violence, sexual references and profanity are part of the daily life. The story line is excellent with great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman especially. I have watched this movie over 20 times and still enjoy it every time I see it just as much as the first time.	10
 Overall	Perfect Movies from plot, cinematography, take, anything	10
 Redemptiom	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	
 Just wow!	Best film ever made,hands down..Actors was soo good..Music..Everything.	10
 abs	I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it	9
 Oldie always Goldie	Great movie, good story and character building. Great cast, alot if greats here.The story is so good and keeps you wanting to watch. It's a definite must watch. Great build good the whole way. Worth every bit of 10. Masterpiece, just go watch it. You won't be disappointed	10
 one of the greatest movies	Great and well planned movie with perfect acting and thrilling plot	10
 A wonderful movie	One of my favorite movies... A beautiful and taking story, with a fabulous casting	9
 Good movie	This is a great movie. Based on a book of a great writer Mr King. I was happy to see great acting and representing the book as it was written. Highly recommend it	9
 HOPE AND FRIENDSHIP	This movie leave me feeling refreshed...i loved the dramatic depiction of hope and friendship	9
 An unforgettable flick..till yet(2018) and till eternity	It was a surprise for me to see such an awesome gripping story in this film.. I'm watching it every month and whenever I realize I'm Timid and weak I watch this movie..it arises my hope everytime and I got back to the life again with +be hopes	10
 Amazing	Legendary. That is all. This film really made me understand the world from a larger perspective than I had before. Acting is amazing and it has an insane plot.	10
 The power of perseverance.	This movie shows us the power of perseverance. Whenever I felt low , I watched this movie. True masterpiece.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 Good but not perfect	Still need improvement in this movie. But boys you can't do it be careful for next time.	7
 You Need To See This	"I have always said that prison doesn't fix people. Prison just makes the rest of us feel safe and nice from the ugly. But true ""correction facilities"" actually correct and fix problems, not just lock it up in a cell somewhere to rot and then get branded when they are spit back out onto the land and expected to acclimate. This movie shows the truth in that. There is no ""debt to society"" that a criminal has to be paid that prison actually meets. No, prison is just society's way of ignoring the issues. If we really want to fix society, we will require restitution, not human branding. The message, the characters, the plot - everything about this film is so well put together and so powerful. It's rough to watch - not for the faint of heart - but try to plow through it anyway. This is a movie you should own - before it gets outlawed when people find out how anti-establishment it really is. This film is brilliant."	10
 Hatts off Morgan Freemen, Tim Robbins, Frank Darabont	This is masterpieces, this movie can not be made..any better nor can they .. Direction,Acting, Story, Dialogue 10 out of all 10....hatts of frank darabont..this movie my inspiration..i love this movie	10
 This is changed my life.	This movie one of the best movie in my life. This film greatest film in the history.	10
 Best Movie	One of the best movies I have ever seen, I can watch this every few months or so and still enjoy it.	10
 good good	Very good movie I'm so happy too see this !Thank you for all actors, It's very exciting !	9
 Just the best	I've been spending years rating films on IMDB to keep a collection of the films I've seen and how I felt about them, and this is the only film after years I've felt that moved that I'm compelled to add a review. It is simply stunning, the story, the acting; cinema doesn't get any better than this.	10
 Must watch movie!	Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner.	10
 Ok	Good film, i am very happy, sad and funny. I think the film make all human to respect	9
 powerful	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Best classic movie!!!	I love Morgan Freeman and have been to the Mansfield reformatory once. It was closed for the season. This Prison, has been used in multiple movies. Anyhow, back to the rating. I give it a 10, i love movies with a narrative setting. Also, loved the fact that he was in prison for a crime that he didn't commit, and he was able to have posters, especially of Rita hayworth in his cell. I didn't particularly, care for the SISTER'S theme, but I do know it happens in prisons, so i can appreciate the set-up for that scenario. I love how Tim Robbins character, developed a relationship with a younger guy so he could mentor him, and then he got killed by the warden's guards. I also loved the ending, when he got revenge on the Warden, and was able to escape with all of the warden's money. Best classic Movie!!! I do end up not watching the Sister's scenario, but other than that this is truly, one of the best classic movies EVER.	10
 good	Andy may well have been crawling through unspeakable filth in that pipe	8
 Best movie ever	You know that kind of movie that makes you feel better. It's perfect.	10
 Greatest movie of all-time	Simply the greatest movie to have ever been made. Exceptional acting, intriguing plot, superb ending, exploration of interesting themes, this movie has it all!	10
 I can't express this movie in words.	There are a lot of movies that tell us something important. But this movie is different from those. If we put all movies on one line,this one can't be put on it. We all should see this movie at least once in our lives.	9
 Great movie, go watch it	Everyone should watch this movie. Profoundly moving and very emotional. Amazing acting. A great watch, a true 10	10
 Probably my favorite movie of all time.	If you havent seen this movie you honestly need too. I am 20 Years Old and i just got around to seeing this movie last night. Obviously i was born after this movie was released and i am very sceptical about older movies but i decided to give it a watch....needless to say i will probably rewatch this movie tonight at midnight. This was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. Everything from the opening scene to the ending scene was incredible. Just another staple and gem to add to the morgan freeman collection. If i could rate this higher than a 10 i most likely would have. This was a fantastic movie	10
 The Best	The best of all movies I have seen. Really great. everyone have to watch this movie.	10

 Best Movie Ever (Review by Roger Ebert)		10
 Lovingggg this	I love this movie but at the same time it makes me feel sad.. i recomend this movie	10
 Very powerful movie	This is an amazing movie. The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing. Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant.	10
 Great story greater execution	No doubt one of the best film there is and ever will be. Everything about this movie, storyline, directing, acting, twists and turns and dialogues are great.One magnificent and rich story combine with excellent filmmaking. Doubt it any movie can replace this for me any time soon ...	10
 Shawshank Redemption	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 There's a reason it's still number one	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	10
 The best	BEST MOVIE EVER YOU GOING TO WATCH SPECIALLY ABOUT THE STORY	10
 Beautiful	One of the best movies, I' ever seen. Amazing story told in an amazing way.	10
 Good movie	I really like this, thank you! Mamaru from Ethiopia! And I wish to have this kind of movies more! I am looking forward!	4
 Amazing!!!	I saw this film recently on Netflix for the first time out of curiosity, just because it's been on top of best films on IMDb and in lots of people's list.I must say it's an amazing film! I never thought I'd like these genres of movies, but this movie has been an exception. Amazing acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I would recommend people who haven't watched it yet to do so. It's worth your time.	10
 the best	The best movie i have ever seen.. touching story...	10
 Best movie of the century	Best drama movie with suspense.Started watching English movies because of this movie.	10

 Fast words		10
 The Innocence and Reality of characters are so Real	I just watched this movie and I enjoyed the characters too much. They were so real for the story and had values that showcased the real life. Also the life of prisoners shown was heart touching and makes this movie MUST WATCHING!	9
 There's a reason it's still number one	This film is amazing and it will always hold a place in my heart. Great actors, great story, great sound and great cinematography. Nothing much else to say!	10
 Fantastic!	Just fantastic! Everyone should watch it The performance of Morgan Freeman is outstanding but the very best performance goes til Tim Robbins. The agony, hurt and anger that he transform into strength and motivation is inspiring, and everyone should definitely take a closer look at this	10
 The journey of life.	A good old tale. Two hour twenty two minutes of unsurpassable storytelling. A poetic dish served by the masterclass.	
 inspiring!	An amazing movie !!an incredible story and stars teach you not to give up no matter how life treats you eventually something good will happen	9
 One of the best movies I have ever watched..!	The story line is attractive, the performance of the actors in performing their roles is pretty good, the environment and customs are chosen carefully and the plot twist is fantastic...	10
 good for look	King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.	10
 Amazing movie	The movie had me on the edge of my seat! Everything about it was great. The camera angle and cinematics were on point. It's a movie to watch for ages to come. the plot is great. The cast of actors were amazing, as well as the producer and director.	8

 Great Movie!	I think the more time passed the better the film is cherished. A complete masterpiece of a dark steorotipycal genre that transform the film over the years.Morgan Freeman forever will be remembered as the greatstest taleman of Shashank and his carrer took over from that point	10
 10/10 - Phenomenal	This is the greatest film I have ever seen, period. If you haven't gotten around to watching this title I highly recommend it, in terms of the story, it is well executed and character development is superb. I cannot fault this film in any way, shape or form.	10

 One of the finest films ever made	One of the finest films ever made. Script perfection, beautifully acted.	10
 Extraordonery	"Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those ""Budget Theaters"" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good"	
 Movie of unbeatable hope	The man teach us a very simple lesson on having hope,through his actions, through his honesty and determination towards what he believes!!	9
 Awesome	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.Awesome movie !	10
 Great movie	Breathtaking, actors did a wonderful job. Best movie ever.	8

 Amazing movie!	I did not knew this movie so far.... i saw him yesterday and i am suprised about the quality of this movie. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in one of theire best.	10
 Hands Down the Greatest Movie Ever Made		
 The masterpiece	The suspense and surprise make this movie a Hollywood legend. It is awesome, the last 30 minutes are unbelievable. You can't catch what's coming. The acting performance by Morgan Freeman and his costars are incredible. This is a masterpiece.	10
 One of the Best	This film is one of the best films ever made. I watched this film on Netflix and was mad after watching I recommend everyone to watch this film.	10
 Good technical movie I had seen	Nice movie, technically very strong. Story line was too good.really liked it.Must watch movie.	9
 Just love this	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story at all as many think. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 This is best	One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.	10
 A human story...		10
 Best Movie - WOW	"This is the best movie I have ever seen. I love this movie. Always remember in my mind. Every one or two month I saw it. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Best best movie. I love it - No words can explain my feelings about this movie. This movie really touch my soul and drop lots of good sign i my mind. I have learned many things.Thank you."	10
 Beautiful, satisfying and quite glorious.	This is the greatest movie ever made of course, anything else than a 5 star for this masterpiece would be an insult. I enjoyed literally every second of it, from the opening court scene, to the reunion of the two friends upon the beach. Everyone has to see this movie at least once.	10
 Outstanding movie		10
 Shawshank	Overall great film from the excellent performances the actors gave to the wonderful cinematography i loved it great story from start to finish	10

 Supper	Very Nice Movie, Really Supper, i am very enjoy watch this movie imdb is very powerful platform	7
 Perhaps the All Time Best Stephen King Movie	I truly enjoyed this film. I read the book after seeing the movie, which is usually not recommended. But this was the rare case where I liked the movie at least as much as the book. Maybe it's because the written version was one of four stories in a collection of four stories, taking away from its focus by 75%. No matter how you slice it though, this movie is worth seeing, and as long as you still have a pulse it will probably make you shed a tear or two.	10
 Nice movies	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	8
 Amazing	Amazing. The Music, interpretations and emotions are absolutley stunning	
 Loved It!	I'm not a typical reviewer who will talk about screen plays and the power of the piece, all I have to say is that this film is amazing, tough to watch in places so be careful if you have a sensitive nature, but so needs watching. I loved it and read the short story by Stephen King straight after. The acting's awesome too so give it a go.	10
 One of the best...	...movies I have ever seen! Peculiar it didn't win an Oscar.

 The best movie in existence	There is no point in reiterating what has previously been said and there are no words that can describe this movie other than the best movie of all time. It's practically faultless and there is never a dull moment. You HAVE to see this movie!	10
 An Experience	This film... Where do I start?... I started watching this with a doubt from what I known about it and was proved wrong. From an Actors point of view this was unbelievable, watching all the characters and their characterisation helped my Acting in this type of character.	10
 Movie must watch.. before you die...	One of the best movie I ever scene..all characters performance are awesome.screenplay awesome..every movie lovers must watch this movie.	9
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	A film that is for all ages and generations...I can not explain the film because it was divided into two categories: one before the film one after the movieHossein Moghaddam form iran	10
 Absolute Greatness	This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever done !	10
 Best Movie of All Time	From the story, to the casting, to the acting, to the direction, to the setting, just couldn't be better. I saw this film on the day it was released and have turned hundreds of people on to it. I have never met anyone who doesn't consider this a classic!	10
 I Need To Say This	No one cares what the 5402nd user has to say about this masterpiece. But I need to get it off my chest; this movie was revolutionary. It was refreshing to see a movie so grounded in reality have a happy ending. It reiterated the fact that hope and happiness are concepts grounded in reality.It was quite cathartic. We sit through most of the movie as a sobbing mess, when different characters die unfair deaths or unspeakable things happen to the protagonist. The entire concept of the movie itself was quite depressing. But then the end comes along, and you see the rain and you feel relief. I remember just laughing as I watched the climax, because I felt genuine happiness for the characters. When a movie is able to do that you know it is good. The acting was phenomenal, the directing was strategic, the writing was fantastic and the cinematography was good as well. I absolutely love this movie, and recommend that you watch it as well. I assure you that even if dramas, or prison movies are not your thing, you WILL enjoy it.	10
 the best ever movie	This is the best of the best movie of all time...!!!	10
 shawshank redemption movie best	This best i have ever seen from the 597 films. Because at this film have important everything about of people. And very emotional	10

The plot touched my soul in so many moments, and in every single one of thoes moments I felt like this movie must be watched by the whole world. I have never met one person who hated this movie. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is just... I don't know, I don't know.Just watch it, you won't regret."	10

 ........... :)	One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship	
 best movie to watch	One of the best movie i ever watch. all actors done fabulous job	10
 Number ONe	There is nothing to say. All the words unsufficent at this point. Just SEE this art..	10
 M.A.S.T.E.R.P.I.E.C.E.	What words can describe such a great film as this . Limitless yet I only need one to compare this film to da Vinci's Monalisa, with such art that the generations to come will still be talking about this film , dissecting it to see what worked for many of us cinema bugs..Tim Robbins' greatest role is here in this film , unsurpassed and for Morgan Freeman , the thunder who never strikes twice at the same place , it is also here. What will you do if you were convicted of a crime you did not commit ask yourself ? I for one, most likely would not have survived as long as Jake and the bird, or any of the wayward pack , yeah boy, do we admire them for their tenacity against the abusive guards, and please remember that this film is set on an era where the inmates and the internal guvs are not as thuggish like it is now for the last 25 years and so, maybe if retold in the modern settings no one would have survived , escaped , got pardoned and let alone rebuild their lives. It is as touching as it can be , as marvelous as real gold in your hands and as clever as you would like it to be. Definitely in my to watch again and again list.	10
 Great film	An excellent script, with great performances and very well direction	9
 Amazing!!!	One of my all-time favorites! I have to watch it at least once or twice a year!	10
 As remarkable as it gets...	Maybe the highest rated prison movie ever... that represents a term that's a bit overused called 'Freedom'. The thing that we sure need in every moment, when someone is takin' it away we always feel it, but here is so direct and sensetive, so we can sense so much empathy for the unlucky bankar, who lost his wife and freedom in so short period. The whole cast, i won't comment.. everyone did a marvelous job. And there's happy ending for a reason a think, 'cause hope is never a thing to give up, if u give up hope, u will get Institutionalized, and quickly when out of prison u have nothing to live for, it definitly gets deep into the prisoners mind, so it will stay as one of the films i always love to watch now and than, definitly a classic.	10
 One of the best	One of the best movies ever.I think this film should play more on national television.	9
 One of the best movies	This movie is just the one of the best movies I've ever watched. It is really really good. Everything's good in it. Some sceneces made me very sad because it made me live the movie like it was my life, like it was me.	10
 must watch	Im sure you know by now that this is required viewing but i urge you to see it without a doubt you will not regret it!	10
 good	Good excellent amazing, i liket i lot.I will see it again	10
 In love	Amazing movie iv watched so many times perfect story perfect film I love it truly amazing xx	10
 Great movie	Great movie. The first movie i saw with Morgan Freeman when i was little. Truly a work of art	9
 HOLY!	This is one of the best movies ever made. The emotions in this flick is so amazing. RECOMMEND!	9
 The best film I have ever seen	This film totally changed my life.I could not tell how it impacted to my life but I become a strong man after watching it.	10
 It was deep	I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yeah	9
 This is so good.	It's a beautiful movie and it so sad. I hope a Spin-Off of this movie will came out.	10
 Guru Badal Bhargav Best Love Marriage Specialist Astrologer in India	Hello Everyone it's really very good movie, I saw this movie maximum 20 time....	10
 Super movie	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.	10
 Some People aren't meant to be caged	Best Movie on the seen. The only seen that effects ma as strongly	10
 Phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella		10
 A true masterpiece.	'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' is easily one of my favourite films of all time (top three material, for sure). It is a true classic that holds the honour of being the highest rated film on IMDb (with a 9.3/10) for good reason. Some scenes will make you laugh, some scenes will make you cry and some scenes will make you do both all at the same time. Each moment will keep you thoroughly entertained and riveted to your seat throughout. It's thanks to well-developed characters and a deeply-effecting story, one that deals with timeless and powerful themes of hope, that this remains such a seminal piece of work. A true masterpiece. 10/10	10
 Excellent movie with a wonderful message - Hope	This movie taught me what hope is. Fear will hold you a prisoner. Use hope as a tool to liberate yourself. Hope will set you free from all your fears.	10
 Simply Awesome	The best movie I have seen. The simplicity of it and the utter brilliance of the entire cast. I wished the movie never ended.	10

 new movie	One of the best movie that i saw , but there is a new movie and tha be infinity war	10
 Best movie	Nice movie American teen drama television series based on the characters of Archie Comics. The series was adapted for The CW by Archie Comics' chief creative officer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, and is produced by Warner Bros. Television and CBS Television Studios, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Originally conceived as a feature film adaptation for Warner Bros. Pictures, the idea was re-imagined as a television series for Fox. In 2015, development on the project moved to The CW, where the series was ordered for a pilot. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia.	9
 Shawshank Redemption will always hit your emotions	"There's a reason why this is No 1 in IMDB Why it has taken me so long to see this film is a mystery with people saying ""How have you not seen The Shawshank Redemption"" I always thought it was just another film inside a prison so nothing special but after watching it I hold my hands up and admit I should have seen this sooner.The relationships that are built come close to even unbreakable especially between Andy and Red. The writing is well thought and it shows through the script.The desire of control over inmates from Warden Norton to is nothing short of incredible.I have seen a lot of websites based on The Shawshank Redemption VS The Green Mile over which one will hit you hardest emotionally. But as hard to believe with The Green Mile was when making Michael Clarke Duncan a man with a child's mind and how well the director making it show as well as the writers. But how as much as this is seen as a to be a cornerstone as a drama class of film and how well it is also seen as at is easy to see why this film is a classic and in some people's mind is the better of the two. However as incredibly emotional this film is as a drama and how hard this film will hit you and will leave you heartbroken and emotionally scarred, The Shawshank takes the lead. admittedly not by a huge margin but not a close call either.Films based in prisons aren't not exactly my first choice of film and even then the ones I had seen before this minus The Green Mile are ones with over the top and unneeded sexism and are filmed to be aimed at teenagers. Shawshank is aimed to convey both minor and clear messages about a friendship between people either best friends or otherwise. Overall to call this film an absolute classic in all of films and one of the best films to watch doesn't quite give this film justice as to how good it actually is. In my opinion this isn't a film that you may need to see, this a film that you have to see."	10
 one of the best movies	Love this movie and watched so many times. truly a timeless classic.	10

It really is all the it reviewed for to be and continues to change movie making history as one of the greats.Reviewed 4.29.20189.1/10Joel Smola	9
 The Best Film of All Time	The Shawshank Redemption is quite simply the greatest film of all time. I completely agree with the other reviews in that this film is something of the soul and can honestly have a huge impact on you. If there's only one film that you watch in life I think Shawshank would have to be the one I recommend the most - despite not being my favourite film of all time I still think it is the best. Undoubtably a 10/10, a complete masterpiece.	10

 No words can give the justice that this movie deserves	The story....the cinematography...and the actors! And ol the actors are at there best.I saw the film for the very time tonight and while I did enjoy it, I felt it was a bit overrated. There's been so much hype and deconstruction of this film over the last 4 decades, it's hard to approach it with a fresh perspective. Th cinematography was really beautiful and the lighting especially in the indoor scenes really set a glorious mood just wow.	10
 awesome movie!	Such an original. love this movie it never gets old!	9
 A Masterpeice	My favorite movie of all time. Quality film in every way and most definitely the greatest voice over in movie history.	10
 One of the best films of all time	Shawshank redemption in my opinion is one of the best films every created. I just recently watched this film for the first time and I was blown away. Shawshank is falsely accused of a crime and is given two consecutive life sentences. In his time in prison he experiences friendships, hardships, and various achievements. Throughout the film I was constantly rooting for Shawshank and his friends, hoping that everything would work out for them. One of my favorite scenes came towards the end of the film. After collecting various items from his friend Ellis, he is able to dig through the wall in his cell and escape the prison by climbing through yards and yards of sewage. This reminded me of the time I visited Alcatraz. I remember hearing about three men who escaped through the wall of their cells by using spoons to dig through the wall. It was sort of like the film Shawshank redemption and I wonder if that's where the inspiration for that scene came from. Overall the movie was inspiring and uplifting and I would definitely recommend seeing it.	9
 One of the greatest movie	When I am in senior school, I saw this film in the classroom.	10
 A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.	A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.

 One of the best films ever ...	It's a beautiful story of friendship, disguised against the cruel backdrop of prison life.Emotional, harsh and pure genius!Should be oneverybodies must see list!	9
 Classic	A great movie to remind society that their are people behind bars that are wrongfully accused	9
 great	This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	9
 #1 Wonder	It's amazing movie and this is one of my starting movies to watch in English but I didn't more because of not much familiar with this language the I got a option of subtitle and then I downloaded the subtitle of this movie, then again watch it and then I started watching movies on English and got very wonderful movies collection on my IMDb watch list.	10

 First Review	One of my all time favorites. Tim Robbins is captivating. Morgan Freeman is convincing. The plot is well written and does a nice job of keeping your attention throughout the movie. A great story about a man's perseverance and test of will. Definitely a relatable and admirable character.	10
 Reality is just in Shawshank.	"If you don't want to watch movies and want to watch reality, then watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Thst's all it takes,really."	10
 amazing movie!	Definitely a 10/10! I would definitely recommend this movie to my friends!	10
 Classic	One of the best movies I have ever seen with such a redeeming quality to it. This is an emotional rollercoaster. I was so moved when I saw this movie and actually did not expect to be so touched. I actually decided to read the book after seeing the movie. It is just such a masterful film and so well written.	10
 One of the best	It is a great movie that shows how is life in prison. One movie that you should not miss.	10
 I'm not gonna waste your time	"I'm gonna keep this review short and sweet, because you shouldn't be wasting your time reading reviews when you can be watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"" instead.This is the best film of all time. Where do I even begin? The foreshadowing, the charm, Morgan Freeman, the emotion, the characters, Morgan Freeman. the music, the rewatchability, did I mention Morgan Freeman?There's a reason why this film is ranked #1 of all time on IMDb. I don't want to waste any more time. Just watch it!"	10
 Tough, ultimately uplifting movie	Stephen King has an interesting gift. He writes stories about painful topics - in this case, a man falsely convicted of killing his wife who has to learn to survive in prison. While a lot of the violence is implied, this movie can still be tough to watch at times.At the same time, King's stories often have a core that centers on things like hope and redemption. This is true here as well. At the end of the day, we watch the main character bring hope to his new friends and finds hope for himself.	9
 Good actor's game!!	"I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."	10
 Loved it	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles."	8
 This film is really an amazing	This film is really an amazing movie timeless. One of my all time favorites.	10
 Highly recommended	Undoubtedly one of the best movies in the history of cinema. Hard, direct, strong, sentimental, perfect. Highly recommended	9
 Great Movie	Awesome movie. One of my favorite movies. I didn't stop watching this movie again and again.	10
 Perfection..	In my opinion the greatest film ever made.Exquisite in every detail with Morgan Freeman's silky smooth narration taking you along on an unforgettable journey..	10
 Simply the best	There's nothing else to say, a must. To not see this movie is a travesty to film. Do yourself a favour and watch.	10
 This movie is a classic!	Worth every minute of watching. The bond between Red and Andy is something that today you won't see!	9
 Great movie but...	This film is an awesome creation but I don't think it deserves to be in the first place. Don't get offended. It's my personal opinion.If you have watched Prison Break Series (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455275/), I don't think you will enjoy this movie. Because, The Shawshank Redemption is a kind of shortcut version of Prison Break Series.But, I enjoyed the movie. Thanks	8
 The definition of hope	Growing up reading Stephen King I thought Stand By Me was going to be best film made from his pages. While Shawshank is a little different than King's vision, the cast (outstanding) and timing in this movie make it a masterpiece 2nd only to the Godfather	10
 3 hours well spent	Though its a long movie, its well worth every second. Daring and unique, this story is unlike any other. Expertly brought to life on screen, this is one of Stephen Kings best short stories.	9
 A unique movie drama with a great plot	One of the best movies I have ever seen. It just pulls you in into the story keeping you curious. Loved it.	10
 Shawshank Redeems Hollywood	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.	9
 One of the best movies ever	There is no doubt that this movie is great and have truly justify its position as highest imdb movie ever. If you really want to enjoy i would recommend to watch it alone with cup of tea. (y)	9
 amazing	Truly incredibly respectable from one of today's most rare and beautiful films	10
 One of the best movies I have watched	Amazing story plot, actors were great and since I've watched this film, I can't help but find another one that reaches it's standard and genre of film. Teaches so much about life and gives so much hope.	
 Best of the Best	Surely the greatest movie of all time in the history of movies.	9

 A Constant Re-watch, Moved Every Time	I don't get emotional over movies very often, but The Shawshank Redemption makes me feel so many different emotions in roughly two and a half hours that I can't help but watch this movie as often as my family and I can stand it.	
 It's a very good movie.	"""This is a movie that a man must see."" Everyone says that. But the mere distinction between sex makes the film narrow. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" broke the limitation of man is almost full of incredible, full of warm tone, and the film's theme is ""the greatest hope"". But when we encountered that prison like Shoschenk imprisoned soul free, we are helpless old Brook, frustrated Reed, or the wisdom of Andy? To use wisdom, to trust in hope, and to face the fear of fear, to defeat it? Classic movies are classic because they are doing the same thing - let you appreciate the beauty of hope from a different angle."	9
 nice!	Want to see this movie again...hope can set you free~~~	9
 one of the best films i have ever seen	Awesome film , that it will transfer you to another world and you will not come back to your world until the end of this film , i would say that it deserve more than 10	10
 my favorite movie	"As soon as he answered the guard and was dangled by his shirt at the edge of the building, I was hooked. This movie has friendship, hope, heart and indomitable spirit.The narration adds a great deal to this film, as it adds a dimension to the story that is overpowering in nature. it makes it feel like you have no control over aspects of what you are seeing.I was drawn in by the actors performances. Even the ""Bull Queers"" pop off the screen whenever I see them in another role. I have only ever been impacted as much by 2 other movies. Forrest Gump and The Green Mile.You can not go wrong with seeing this movie."	10
 Awesome	One of the best jail/prison movies ever created. This movie changed my life.	10
 One of the greatest book to movie adaptation to ever exist		10
 The most satisfying movie ever	What can you say, this movie is one of my favorites. I have to watch it every time it comes on TV. I love it!	10
 Amazing movie.	Great movie for family watching or watching with friends.One of my favorite movies. 10/10	10
 GOAT	GOAT..... absolutely the greatest movie of all time in my eyes. From the acting to the incredible story line, it keeps you enthralled the entire time. Great beginning and a better ending.	10
 Get busy living or get busy dying.	An incredible film, indeed one of the best movies of all time. It manages to connect with the audience in different levels and the message of redemption, and hope is powerful and valuable to anyone watching.The actors are incredible, they show sincere dedication to each of their roles and play them wonderfully. The narration of Morgan Freeman is exceptionally superb (as it always is).	9
 just amazed!!!	One of the best ever movie, i did really enjoyed it	10
 (y)	I need watchin' this film again. Epic story, everything is great. Good job :)	10
 A testament to the human spirit...	"Seeing The Shawshank Redemption for a second time reinforced my feeling of admiration for this splendid film. Although I am writing my review in 2014 -- twenty years after the movie's original release -- it seems as fresh and alive as ever. Top-notch performances by all cast members, exceptional cinematography by Roger Deakins, and masterful direction by Frank Darabont (who also penned the screenplay based on Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"") combine to make the film something special indeed.Co-stars Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins simply transform themselves into two unconventional prisoners. Their inspired acting helps us understand the virtue of patience and hope, regardless of how long and how much suffering one might face. Freeman plays ""Red"" Redding, a man who has adapted to prison life by becoming the institution's ""go to"" guy for various items from the outside world. Robbins is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. These very different men become friends who think decency and kindness are important, even in the brutal prison environment.That brutality may be very hard for viewers to watch, but those disturbing scenes are necessary to give the film its gritty realism. Sadistic Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) runs Shawshank Prison like it's his own personal kingdom, and Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown) carries out the warden's orders -- very enthusiastically.Things change for the better when Captain Hadley receives help with some paperwork from Andy. It's not long until Andy is assisting all the guards with their tax returns. Soon Warden Norton takes interest in Andy and uses him for his own paperwork. The result? The warden grants little favors that improve the lives of the prisoners. Unfortunately, a new prisoner (Gil Bellows) arrives with a revelation about Andy's case -- one that creates chaos for everyone concerned. The only thing Andy can do involves a daring escape. But how? And what will happen to Red if Andy leaves? Although The Shawshank Redemption boasts a number of memorable scenes, my favorite shows Andy broadcasting an opera selection to the entire prison population. All the men are stunned as they listen in awe to the beautiful music. However, as you've probably heard, no good deed goes unpunished. Especially at Shawshank. Released in 1994, this acclaimed motion picture earned seven well-deserved Academy Award nominations including a Best Actor nod for Morgan Freeman. The film also won the Humanitas prize, the Crystal Heart Award from the Heartland Film Fest, and was among the National Board of Review's Top Ten Films of 1994."	10
 PERFECT FOREVER	I Just want to say IT'S PERFECTI saw this movie many times and always I think that one was the first timeThe story is like an ocean !	10
 good job	That was a good and intresting film. I have been rated that 10 star.	7
 This is How Movies Should Be Made	"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want."	10
 Stupendous Movie	It teaches how important hope has a role to play in our lives and no matter what hurdles we face in our life, we must keep the hope and never give up. This message was beautifully portrayed in this film.	10
 One of the most touching Films	Why I am Ali writing another review? Just the confirm that the other 200 + reviews before me feel the same about this wonderful film.	10
 great movie	Great movie, if I had any real ambition I would aspire to be one of these actors.	10
 Not best movie I have ever seen.. but also great movie :)	I like this movies because The actors are amazing in this movie also this movie has magnificent subject and dialogue...	10
 Best movie of all time	The first time i saw this i was absolutely amazed. I have seen this movie many times since, and it's just always a great experience.I think this is a movie that everyone would love. This is with out a doubt the best movie i have ever seen.	10
 devan's review	This film makes me not wanna go to jail. But now I know how to escape if I ever did. The guy from american history x should of took notes. If someone you know hasn't seen this movie they should give there head a shake. Like get it together , you don't know Morgan freeman unless you have seen this movie. But I haven't seen the green mile. So maybe I should give my head a shake. Wow I guess i'm eating my own words here. But I heard the green mile is sad and I don't wanna cry. Whats the point of a movie if it just gonna make you sad. You don't just say hey you wanna watch Schindler's list than watch Saving private Ryan, and old yeller. No, that would suck.	10
 A Wonderful Movie	Best Movie about Prisons Life and Best Revenge I have Ever Seen ..	9
 Good	"This film is really an amazing movie timeless.One of my all time favorites.About the long-can write something in a movie.Masters said everything I needed There is not yet aware of the movie and I watched it for people to watch I would like to invite.Than You.Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 hope is everything	Just awesome movie about hope that you can not forget til you die	10
 How to start a film	Choose A Short Script. Although a filmmaker might be tempted to grab a camera and begin shooting impromptu scenes, a good film tells a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end	9
 An all-time favourite	A great movie that shows that brains beat physical strength. And that good triumphs evil.	10
 Best Movie I have ever seen	Good movie indeed. It is really attractive.I like it a lot	
 Amazing	One of the must amazing films i ever watch.. great movie, amazing story....	10
 Best movie I have ever seen	This movie is a movie that I never intended to watch. I had the movie on my laptop but never even bothered to consider to watch this movie. One afternoon, I had nothing to do so I watched The Shawshank Redemption. And I am so glad that I did. What a fine movie! I literally have no words to describe the awesomeness of this movie.	10
 Best movie of all time!	The best movie i have seen ever, Morgan Freeman just nails it!the story is one of the best.	10
 Like no others!	In this new world of green screen movies,with superhumans,superheroes and creatures, it's refreshing to see an old and real movie.With a great cast,who are delivering too the point,this movie shares the values of humanity,bringing back the good in all of us,that we forget too fast, in our day to day life.Make yourself a service and watch it!	9
 Best Movie ~Must See	The best movie of all time. Hope should never die.	10
 One of the most...	Memorable movies I have ever seen. Everything about this movie is fantastic.	10
 Great Movie.	This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. It has and still does stand the test of time. This film introduced me to the magic of Tim Robbins. Robbin's portrayal of Andy Dufresne hits you right in the heart. You root for him the entire duration of the film. Robbin's performance prompts viewers to empathize with his character, while Freeman's performance adds a certain grit that is needed for the storyline. The chemistry between Robbin and Freeman brings an authentic feel to this film.	9
 Fantastic!	"Ellis Boy ""Red"" Redding: I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him."	10
 it's definitely a 10/10 movie	I don't know that it's the best to me, ''best''s are always personal.but this masterpiece of cult movie can be one of the best of all.	10
 Powerful!	Let me make this simple, this is one of the best films that you will ever see. For me it just might be the best film ever and I've watched a lot of films.	10
 Great	One of the best movie. Everybody should watch this movie.	9
 Amazing	I liked the plot twist at the endone of my favorite movies	10
 Excellent performance by great actors	No matter how many times I see this movie I am not bored. I know the action, the lines, the characters reaction but somehow every time I watch the movie I feel something new. It's that type of movie that it's made for the right actors to have their best performance and I think that this is the reason that the movie is one of the best in cinematography.	10
 Not Sure Why not	Hmmmm simply best i was not sure why rating was so high but when i watched it got to know why. it simple and best script, act and etc etc.You will have fun watching it if you like suspense.	10
 Classic and timeless!	Super storylines in this movie! I was impressed that the prisoners in the prison yard were Steel workers from Ohio.	10
 A movie with Values and lesson!!!!!	A Astounding drama set which shows how life can change at any moment of time .....Morgan freeman's best performance!!!!!	10
 Amazing	Definitely one of the best movies I've seen. You wont be disappointed	10
 Great Direction & Story	Story is key. Nothing else matters. This film had it all. Great direction, cast, but most importantly, had a amazing story.	
 One of the greatest movies ever made	"I've seen a lot of movies and this is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This's one of the greatest Dramas i've ever seen. This's how a movie should be made! A good story, setting and most importantly, Characters we can relate to and care for. The reason being there's a part of them that we can relate to at some point in our life or it's just a part of our personality. How many of us have felt wrongly accused and punished for something like the main characters? How many of us felt chained and lost in this world? That's how Red and Brooks feel upon leaving prison. The story's about a banker named Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) who gets convicted for the murder of his former wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in prison.While struggling to adapt he befriends the other inmates named Ellis ""Red"" Redding(Morgan Freeman) and elderly librarian Brooks Hatlen(James Whitmore) who help him out. After overhearing the captain Bryon Hadley(Clancy Brown) complaining about the inheritance tax he has to deal with Dufresne offers his help which leads to him getting protected by the guards from these brutal inmates known as the ""Sisters"" led by serial rapist Bogs(Mark Rolston). Slowly and slowly the conditions improve inside the prison particularly the library. In spite of this Dufresne still knows he doesn't belong here and plots his escape with the help of Red. It's going to take more than hope to break out of this fortified prison. Bottom line, it's a classic worth checking out."	10
 One of the Greats	A very select batch of films maintain their impact upon third or forth watch - This is one of them - One of the chosen few and One of the Greats that is for sure. Perfectly cast, with the story perfectly unfolded to the audience - You'll never forget the time you watched The Shawshank Redemption, It just stays with you until the next time you come to watch it.	9

 ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I' VE EVER SEEN	ASTONISHING MOOVIE. EXCELLENT CAST. INCREDIBLE STORY	10
 A movie about time,also hope.		9
 Beautifully Written.	Perhaps the only flaw this movie has is that it may be a bit over-the-top sentimental, but that is the charm of it as well. I enjoy that we can see the good in these people who were always good. It gives us hope that we are all redeemable. Stephen King is a better writer with this type of story. Some of his horror falls into stereotypes.	9
 HOSSSPADE 9 OUT 10	KAKAYA GODNOTA PROSTO OHUET KRAJNE REKOMENDUYOU!!!!!	9
 I have never seen such an amazing film	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 The Classic that's gonna last forever		10
 Review	Great. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie, would recommend.	10
 Super movie. one of my favorite movie.	Super movie. one of my favorite movie. Its all about faith and struggle of a man in the jail.	9
 9/10	Masterpiece, another prison escape must-see movie.	9
 DEv	The Shawshank Redemption movie is Best, so I watched this movie many times, you must seen this movie too, good job.	8
 A movie that makes you a better person	I want to apologize for my English, I'm a young french guy, born in 89, and I have seen the movie first time on TV late for a kid, after 10 pm a bet, maybe in 98 or 99. I have to say that from since, the movie just changes me, and it changes me more every times I watch it. I may consider myself like a nihilist type of person since I remember. So I can't define myself like « full of hope ». But, back to the movie, when you see « Shawshank Redemption », doesn't matter if are living the best or the worth day of your life, you just see the bright side in life ! You just feel like, almost for a moment, maybe for a day, a week, there is hope in this world. Keeping hope in yourself, doing the best you can for the people around you, waiting for « your » moment to be happy is just the best you can do down here in this world. I just have seen the movie right before writing this, for the the twentieth time in my life maybe, but I just realize that I' m acting for years fallowing the « Shawshank Redemption » inspiration. I just let behind me bad feelings and bad thoughts, acting the best I can for my family, friend and people I care about, and that make me happy, like Andy in the whole story. Buddhism says that in every situation, you can stay with the good part, see the bright side. It's exactly what the movie is talking about: Andy get himself into prison, maybe not as a bad person, but maybe a bit selfish, maybe not using his knowledge and skills for helping others. He got out, washed of every single bad pieces of himself. He got out a better person. To me, that 's just the best movie ever, and that 's gonna be like very close to impossible to find a better one. An artwork that give you so much, and tries, successfully, to change you into a better person. How is possible to find a better impact for an artwork ?	10
 Cracking film	Top film,seen it at least 5 times. Not to be missed	8
 BOA	Best of all. i love this movie cuz this movie is near to real life , and if we wish something harder we can do everything. RESPECT	9
 Always On	I bet Shawshank is playing on a station somewhere sometime at every hour of the day. That being said I can watch it every time I come across it.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	"Brilliantly crafted film from beginning to end that has only gotten better with age. The cast gives career best performances, with Morgan Freeman cementing his place as Hollywood's favorite narrator in Red while Robbins is charming & mysterious as Andy Dufrane. They are surrounded by an excellent supporting cast, particularly Robert Gunton as the menacing warden & James Whitmore as the tragically fated Brooks. Behind the camera, Frank Darabont brilliantly adapts Stephen King's story and quite frankly improves it by condensing the story & characters (this, like ""Jaws"", ""The Godfather"", & ""The Princess Bride"" rank as films that are actually better than their books). His direction is nicely non-flashy & gives the actors plenty of time to breathe. He also doesn't cheat in building towards the brilliant ending (one of the best in film history) laying clues but not spelling them out, making repeat viewing all the more fun (notice how Andy is only presented from other's perspectives & not his own). Simply put, one of the best film's produced in the last 30 years and a classic by any definition."	9
 Very noice	..................................................................................... .......................................................... ............................................ ............................... .................... .......... ..... ...	8
 Awesome	One of the Finest and best movie I have ever seen in my life time and it never gets old.	10
 Powerful movie	Best mystrical movie of 94s and I love that huh the acting by andy us good	9
 Inspirational	A story of freedom and friendship beyond concrete and bars.	8
 Number 1	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Cried Real Tears	This movie has so many great moments, watch it. This review is only to complete my IMDb profile.	9
 .................	.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	10
 Love love love this movie	This movie has it all. If you haven't watched it do ur self a favor and do so	
 Don't let the name fool you.	I remember not having any expectations about this movie and was pleasantly surprised after the movie. The overview I got prior to watching was that is was prison-buddy movie, but it is definitely more than just that. It definitely grew on me over time and one of the few movies that I can re-watch over and over and still find it refreshing and new.	10
 Timeless classic	One of the most gripping movies of all time. Its a fantastic journey which has three characteristics:1. It would take a really long time to complete. He has a feel for how long it would take - but he doesn't know that exactly. And that feel changes every day as well.2. He can get caught at any point - in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end - literally on any given day until he is done - and if he is caught, all his efforts up to that point add up to nothing. The net effect of getting caught would be negative, in the form of additional punishment, added with absolutely no scope of receiving a parole thereafter3. The end result is binary: If he gets caught, twenty years' effort adds up to nothing. On the other hand, if he succeeds, he can be a free man and live the rest of his life happily.If you think about it, the exact same characteristics are shared by anyone working on a Startup (in addition to the fact that only fools would embark on a journey with these characteristics):1. It would take a really long time to complete. You have a feel for how long it would take - but you don't know that exactly. Besides, this feel changes everyday.2. You can fail at any point- in the beginning, in the middle, or at the end - literally on any given day until you are done - and if you fail, all your efforts up to that point add up to nothing. The net effect of a failure would be negative, in the form of lost investment, opportunity costs, and a bunch of significant 'could have beens'3. The end result is binary: If you fail, you will feel that your efforts added up to nothing. If you succeed, well.....It might be a strange observation to make from a movie about people serving life-terms in prison - but if you observe closely, the simple and most powerful message from 'The Shawshank Redemption' is this: 'Enjoy The Journey'.	10
 masterpiece!	This is my favourite movie!Every time i see this movie,i understand that hope and faith are the best things in the world!!The actors in this movie were perfect and the director awesome!	10

 Frank Darabont	The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption	9
 I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank	Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	9
 The best	The best movie I've ever seen and I'm not bored to see it always.	10
 Must See	This is a must see classic movie. I love Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I could watch this movie 20 times and not mind.	10
 Astonishing movie	Lovely movie, one of my all time favorites. There's not a single boring second, it's very moving and very well acted. I can't really think of anyone who won't like this, it's a masterpiece.

 Spoiler free review	After 24 years, watching this Tales of the Prisoner adaption from Stephen King novel in 1994. A brilliant and masterpiece film from Hollywood. This movie also banned from release in cinema in Malaysia due to the prior excessive content. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman just nailed it. This movie is still the first in top rated IMDb movies.	9

 Masterpiece Forever	I indeed think that this picture is forever going to hold the audience's attention. Never gets old and never disappoints.	10
 I have ever seen the best movie	I am not sure-almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said.But like so many other people who wrote comments,I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent dioiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	9
 Change	This movie is a masterpiece which can affect my life.In this movie, Shawshank was in prison more than twenty years. Some of them could not adapt the world's changes when they went out the prison. So they chose to suicide. Nonetheless, he kept learning even if he was in prison. So he lived a happy life when he went out the prison.I hope all of us can keep learning and can adapt the change of the world quickly.	10
 Change	This movie is a masterpiece that can affect my life. Shawshank was in the prison more than twenty years. He is really driven, Even if he was in the prison, he kept learning. You know, some of them, when they went out prison, they can't adapt the world's changes. So they suicide. Nonetheless, he can adapt the change and take some measures. It impressed me a lot.I hope that everyone can keep learning that you can adapt the changes of the world quickly.	10
 Best movie	All time favorite this is where my addiction to Morgan Freeman movies began	10
 Hope	Some people are like birds,they are ready to fly evert moment!	9
 Good but not for me	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the 1982 Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the prison warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, and James Whitmore appear in supporting roles."	
 GREAT MOVIE	This is the best movie ever that i have watched...	10
 Unforgettable	Prison, murder and mystery- as a teenage girl at first glance this film didn't sound like my cup of tea, however Frank Barabont created a film that both me and my family love!The acting is incredible, the qoutes are powerfull and the storyline is so cleverly written that the ending (and I can't put this any better) had me shock.It is probably the best film i have ever and will ever see.	10
 One of the best!	The casting is superb - every actor is perfectly suited for his role and does an excellent job!	10
 Brilliant	This is the best movie in the world. Other movies is not best. But this movie is the best movie. I am very to watch this movie. I love this movie content. Drama, Strategy, Romance	10
 Great!	One of my favorite movies! The acting and story telling was great.	10
" Do you agree ? ""Despite its status as a classic, The Shawshank Redemption is not quite a great film"", argues Robbie Collin"	"The satirist William Donaldson, writing in his Dictionary of National Celebrity, defined Stephen Fry as 'a stupid person's idea of what an intelligent person is like'. It's an ungenerous quip, but loaded with just enough truth to really sting - and by the same token, The Shawshank Redemption could be described as the all-time favourite film of people who haven't seen very many.Frank Darabont's uplifting prison drama has been perched at the top of the Internet Movie Database's top 250 chart, which is voted for by the website's users, since 2008 - one place above The Godfather, and 58 above Vertigo, the Greatest Film of All Time as triangulated by Sight & Sound magazine in their international poll of critics last year. Those same critics showed little love for Darabont's creation: against Vertigo's 191 votes, The Shawshank Redemption received just one.Why should that be? Darabont's film is a handsome, well-acted tale of physical imprisonment and spiritual escape - hardly box-ticking Hollywood product. It was the Hungarian-born director's feature debut, adapted as a labour of love from the Stephen King short story Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, and was well-reviewed on its release in 1994.Received wisdom has it that the film was a box-office flop, but that narrative doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny: after a slow start it recouped its budget in the US and took £2.3 million in the UK - hardly a record-setter, but by no means disastrous. It was also nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Morgan Freeman's rich-roasted turn as Ellis Redding, the veteran inmate of Shawshank State Prison who takes Tim Robbins's Andy Dufresne under his wing.Perhaps the reason we think of The Shawshank Redemption as unappreciated in its time is that in 1994, cinema culture was dominated by two very new-fangled films: Robert Zemeckis's Forrest Gump, which digitally airbrushed Tom Hanks into 40 years of US history, and Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, the snappy, scrappy herald of new American independent cinema.Related ArticlesThe Shawshank Redemption, Edinburgh Assembly Rooms 06 Aug 2013Review: Secret Cinema presents The Shawshank Redemption 03 Dec 2012Tim Robbins back behind bars - as an acting mentor 02 Sep 2013How could an old-fashioned prison break compete? King described his original story as having been written ""in the grainy old Warner Bros/Jimmy Cagney mould"", and in the film version, Roger Deakins' honey and pitch-toned cinematography certainly amplifies the antique mood. The Shawshank Redemption simply wasn't a conversation-starter: it didn't break rules, or start a revolution, or crown a movement, or change the business. It was just a good story, well-told, and that was pretty much all you could say about it.And yet when it comes to the actual business of what happens to a film's reputation after its theatrical debut - that mystical process the studios call 'word-of-mouth' - good stories, well-told count for a lot. The audiences who went to see Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction at the cinema spent 1995 catching up with The Shawshank Redemption on video, and then recommending it to their friends, who rented it the following week.Could that be a crucial part of the film's appeal? Few of us can remember ever being sold The Shawshank Redemption: we mostly discovered it under our own steam, which makes our relationship with Darabont's film feel more precious and personal than, say, Forrest Gump, the release of which was a media event measurable on the Richter scale.Almost 20 years on, one major point of contention still rankles: that schmaltzy Hollywood ending, resisted by Darabont but insisted on by the production company, Castle Rock Entertainment. The director wanted to fade to black after Red climbs onto the bus, with that sensational final line left hanging: ""I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.""Up to this point, the entire story has been pushed along by hope, and to remove it at the last moment, even by fulfilling it, is to steal the wind from the film's sails. The Shawshank Redemption is almost a great film, but not quite; its status as a classic, though, seems assured.ROBBIE COLLIN'S"	9

 Truly a great fiml	I enjoyed the movie, there is no more to say. I just watched it recently for the first time, worst of all it was for a school project, probably the best task I have ever had though. So i saw it in possibly the worst setting ever and still loved it. Seriously I have no complaint about it. Must watch!	9
 I like this film so much.	And I think it is the best film at that time! Andy is a superman.	10
 Permanent Winner in Film History	Never ever lose a point versus any movies, both old ones and moderns!This is incredibly great.	10
 Perfect film for all kind of moments	Once you are sad, happy, depressed, eupophoric or whatever this is your film.	10
 This movie is amazing	This movie is insane. Tim Robbins was perfect in this movie. This movie would have been way different if one person was changed from the cast. It just shows the struggle through prison of being wrongly convicted. This movie brings a tear to my eye. I could feel the power of the hug between Andy Dufresne, and Red at the end of the movie.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption review	It was a great movie I liked it so much andy was very smart you will figure that	8
 Best	Movie Best - The Shawshank Redemption (1994).- iMDb 9.3	10
 All Time Great	Truly nothing more to say than this is one of the greatest films ever made. Shawshank is better upon each viewing which seemingly is nearly impossible given that it is such a quality film. If you've never seen this film, grab some popcorn, cancel your plans tonight, and sit down and let it save your life.	10
 Seven Oscar nominations and not one award; has the world gone mad?	Beautifully shot, lovingly portrayed by Tim Robins, Morgan Freeman, et al., written and directed with aplomb from beginning to end.That Shawshank didn't win any Oscars but tops just about every list of best movies ever is an injustice bordering on a travesty.	10
 Great movie	Great movie. I had a lot of feelings with this movie because bring me great memories. It is the perfect resume of a hard life	10
 Brilliant movie!	"All is perfect : the complexity of the characters, the suspense, the principals themes like friendship, loneliness, injustice, redemption, vengeance, freedom... The most complete movie that I've ever seen. Tim Robbins is great, sensitive, brilliant: in one scene, he can feel a thousand of feelings. Freeman is very correct and seems to be really ""Red"". Gunton, Sadler and all the others seemed to have fun playing in this master of peace. Titanic is pure entertainment and received 11 Oscars. This movie deserves 30 Oscars because it shows what is really important in life. No action, more realistic, more useful than the other films. It was really a BIG BANG in my head the first time i saw it. When i see it again, I think and I realize the incredible power that the cinema's industry have. In a different way, only Star Wars, Saving Private Ryan and some others have the same impact!"	10
 NOT ENOUGH CARS	Not enough muscle cars, it needs more bikini babes, muscle cars, and Paul walker. I was expecting to see car races, but all I saw was Morgan freeman and prison rape	8
 awesome movie	Awesome movie with a great mix of action and unforgettable scenes	10

 Amazing	One of the best movies I've ever watched.The story and the photography are great	10
 Must Watch	It's not the number one rated movie on IMDb for nothing. I can go on and on about why this film must be watched, but to keep it short, this film is not just a prison movie, it is so much more than that. It's a character piece, it's about friendship, it's about corruption, it's about life in and outside of prison and how difficult it is adjusting from one to another, but most importantly it is about how important freedom is, and how you use it. Just watch it	10
 Perfection	This is a perfect movie. I love the message of hope.	10
 One of the best Movie	Movie goes slow but this was one the best movies and one should watch this one.	10
 I very like this film	I very like this filmThe Shawshank RedemptionHow many times have I seen this movie? I enjoyed so much. This film is very popular in Iran. Although a lot of films have been made in these years, this film is one of the best films of the 1990s	10

 The greatest movies of all time	This movie will forever be one of the greatest movies ever made.	10
 best movie	Wow nice film, i loved it so muchThe Shawshank Redemption is true example about film-making	10
 Pretty Powerfull	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrail of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Epic history	This is possible the best movie I have ever seen! The twist at the end is so fantastic and changes the entire movie.If you have not seen it yet, do it today!	10

 impressive	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are crucial to the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not the supernatural kind, but the sort that flows from the realization of 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine."	10
 lit	Best movie ever for ever for I recently think that this is a different way of creating a different way to make the world more important for the future and the world is more important	10
 Truly one of the greatest films ever made	It was one of the first american films I've watched during my childhood years. To be honest I didn't get to it first but after a couple of years , watching it brings me more and more pleasure. A truly great movie with some amazing acting and soundtracks. Strong in almost every aspect. It makes you rethink the way you see things and most importantly it teaches you how important freedom is for human beings. A film that will be watched and praised even after a century or two.	10
 The Shawshank Remption was a great movie	This is an old movie I use to watch when I had cable and watching it once more on kodi was great	10
 1?	This is great movie but not the beest movie of ever!!!	7
 the best movie I have ever seen	"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	10
 Old but gold	I was extremely impressed by the story in the movie. I love the actors, they played so well.	8
 Must watch	A truly wonderful movie about patience and hard work	9
 Best Morgan Freeman Movie	Best Morgan Freeman Movie ever.....................................................!	10
 Great	The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	10
 Best Film Ever	This film is awesome. I cried, laughed and learned a few things. The production was great and the cast was perfectly chosen. I took the kids to see this and they understood everything and also enjoy watching it with. I hope to see another film like this. I don't think a pt 2 is in the makes so I'll settle for another film something like it.	10
 The Best!	It definitely deserves the first place on the list.	10
 Good with that time	"I think it ok with that time H's father was a profoundly conservative man, but with opinions surprising for a supposed Southern Democrat and which had nothing to do with economic orthodoxies. ""The Democracy"" meant to him as a young man William Jennings Bryan, and then FDR, and the radical but very odd, sometime Republican labor leader (he supported both Hoover and Willkie) John L. Lewis-that last at least an unexpected hero for a small businessman. ""These damned fools around here don't know that if labor costs go up five percent, it's the owners who will grin and raise prices fifteen."" When the Democrats selected Adlai Stevenson for the first time, he preferred Estes Kefauver of the coonskin hat. He was a populist, although without (H was pleased to note when he learned a bit more history) the nativist spite, anti-Semitism, and general small-town prejudices that often degraded populism. So, deficient in Oedipal rage, H had no great distance in feeling to travel when he went to college: reading of ""the cross of gold,"" writing a paper on Henry George, devouring biographies of Eugene Victor Debs, writing for a card in Noman Thomas's Socialist Party-well on his way, through books not experience, to possession of the ""proper"" views for an academic before he knew he would become one. However, a big however, when he studied English history under a professor he'd discover many years later was a contributor to Russell Kirk's journal Modern Age, H always ""pulled for"" the Royalists rather than the Roundheads, admired the Tories rather than the Whigs. A kind of schizoid tendency was setting in."	8
 EPIC	Amazing cinema, one of the best movies i have ever seenacting is so genuine and cinematography is well developed	10
 One of the best movies ever made...	"Probably yes, acting was good, plot brilliant, I mean Stephen King wrote the book, but it can't match the film. When I saw this movie I thought ""thats it, this is it, best movie ever"". Sure you can find people who didn't like it, and when I ask ""why"", and try to guess what then happened? They just confused themselves, they can say reason why they don't like this movie... When I try to read comments with 1/10 star, I can't find comment with good reasons that could make me realize, that this movie is a bad movie, If there is no reason, then this means, that its the best movie ever made!The only reason people are giving 1 star is that they don't like ratio ""9,2"", they want to do more effect by pull this high ratio down, I really hate them :) Sorry for my bad English language, I live in asia, my English teacher is big cow with no knowledge..."	10
 simple and great	Simply great from actors to directors to the writer all perfect ....	9
 <3	It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.	10
 when a soul is entrapped in an endless loop. you need focus and time.	When a soul is entrapped in an endless loop. you need focus and time.	10
 Instant Classic	A memorable storyline along with one of the most breathtaking soundtracks ever written. Whether you are a fan of action, romance, or drama, this film will entertain you to the end.	10
 Ana L. Ortiz-Wienken's Review: Fanstastic Score!	Thomas Newman does an incredible work in writing the score for this film. Especially the main theme Redemption cue where he applies an ongoing ostinato that immediately drags us into the mysterious harsh atmosphere of the jail. However he keeps the sweetness in the melody portraying an especial tender towards the protagonist.	9
 Breath taking	This is one of the films you must see. Even though there are many dialogs in this movie you won't miss the action and the thriller. This movie kept me pinned to my seat from the very beginning till its end. The story is magnificent and the acting of the main role actors is above excellence.	10
 Classic	Performances, Direction, Lighting, Writing, Location management, Production....... All completely on point, I love this movie.	10
 One of the all time greats	"So many clichés spawned from this film as did Freeman's own ""Morgan Freeman being Morgan Freeman"" style of acting. That being said it's hard to watch it and not feel joy at the little victories the cons manage to win. Tops the list of best films again and again but you can see why if you're looking for a man's chick flick."	8
 Perfect 10	The shawshank redemption is the only movie which consists of a blend of Patience+Hope+Emotions+Education and True Friendship.I know that there are a lot of great movies but it really deserves to be on top of the list.if you watch this movie once,i am sure that u will watch it again& again and can never be obsessed with it.this movie proves that it is bigger than theacademy awards AKA The Oscar awards.first you see it and then eventually you will seek redemption.	10

 it is pretty good but is it really the best?	For a movie to be considered the best ever made i feel the all aspect of the movie should be amazing and rase no question as to why it is simply the best. Do not mis understand me here i think the store is great. Its just was everything else about the film amazing.	8
 great...	Must see movie at least three times every 5 years ,to have another perspective and learn more . its more than a film. documentary	10
 Tek kelimeyle bir baska	Izledigim filmeler arasinda pek hayli yer kaplamaktadir	9
 It is the most gripping film I have ever watched.	When you watch this movie, you start to question the life and the words blame and innocence.when I first watched it I was hooked.it appealed to me a lot.I learnt that there is always a hope for humankind and instead of trying to prove your innocence, live your life this movie says.It is an unforgettable movie that although I watched it many years ago, now I'm writing review for it.I strongly recommend to all people even if it's possible to animals.I hope u enjoy it stay strong stay with hope.	10
 Well it is was wery good. Don't pay attention.	I really like it. I want to try watch it in original.	10
 Best movie ever, we need more like it	This is the best movie I've ever seen, and I don't understand why in 21th century film producers can't make another movie like this, or more like this.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever watched!	One of the best movies I've ever watched! The dichotomy between the idea of guilty and innocent in parallel with the fact that they present the freedom content of the film is fascinating.	9
 More like Slawshank	This movie was okay, but it had coleslaw in it too much. I think if we take the coleslaw out of the motion picture industry, I would be relieved.	5
 Great movie	Gf finally got me to watch this cause of family guy reference. great movie. best i have seen in a while	9
 I LOVE THIS SHOW	Best tv show ever i love this show so much and i hope the audience of this tv show loved it and i gave this show 10 rates !!!!	10

 Simply Brilliant!	This movie gives you insipiration and motivates you, that you're able to accomplish anything in life by putting your mind to it, the story-line in this movie is fantastic, very entertaining and can be watched over and over again, deserves the title 'Greatest movie of all time', and nothing is able to beat it's reviews and ratings yet. 10/10 - Iky	10
 A masterpiece	I'm jealous of people who will see this movie for the first time.There is nothing else to say ...	10
 perfect	Just perfect.one of the best movies i have ever seen in my entire life.	10
 Amazing film	One of the most amazing films I have ever watched, script photography everything. You will not be dissapointed. Loved it!	10
 A Must See!	This is a film that can please anyone of any taste. Put in simple terms, this is a movie I highly recommend. It has a cast that works so naturally well together and not for one moment does the acting feel artificial or forced. I can not speak highly enough for this film.	10
 One of my Favorite	It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	9
 awesome	What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.	9
 great	Great movie thats pne of my favorites and would reccommend to all	9
 Nothing makes me cry, but this one.	"I selected this movie because the obvious well rating that it has in here, and i thought it was weird because i have never heard of this movie in real life (what a shame!) This movie works by the hope of prisioners, and hope it's underrated, but it can literally move the world, i think with this movie you realize how important is having hope in your life, you cannot go aroung being a negative person that will kill you fast. We all feel conected to this brilliant film because none of us imdb's writers have the perfect life, it just doesn't exist. We all need hope, this movie is beautifully encouraging us to get what we want, nothing makes you feel better than someone telling you ""You can do it, i believe in you"", i guess that's how we humans work.I love how they made us love the characters, not just the protagonist, how they made us cry, they succeed! They filled us with feelings, they made us think.Anyone that wants to get into filmmaking or writting of some sort should see this movie very carefully because it is a masterpiece.Totally not overrated, totally recommended!"	10
 Love this	Great movie, great cinematography, great acting. I really enjoyed this.	
 Masterpiece	Greatest movie of all time!!!I watched it more than 50 times, saw it first time when i was i kid. And every time i saw it i noticed something new. It must be as i grow older i see it from different perspective, and i could watch it again and again and every time i'm so excited to watch it like it's first time.	10
 The Shank	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of the 90's era, it's a must see in my book. Movie Goers of every generation will love to see Andy sail off into the sunset.	10
 The Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!	This is a loooonnnnnggg movie but I didn't miss a second of it. Trust and friendship in such a deplorable situation is amazing. Truth can be found everything and even in through the bad. I hope to see a pt 2 of this	10
 Morgan at his best	I love this movie. It had a meaning and the story was amazing. I wish it had a part 2	10
 Easily the best movie I've even seen	Mesmerizing, very moving, amazing plot twist. You get to see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in the pinnacle of their young acting genius.Watch it at all costs.	10
 Just simply the most beautiful film ever made	Everything about this film is just amazing. I could watch it everyday of my life.	10
 Stay Strong	This movie shows us how to stay strong even in a miserable situation. Even if you are in a bad position and cant see you getting through, you have stay strong because you don't know when & how you will have the chance to pull it together. So i think this movie is one of the best example of survival and we need to survive if we want to live in this terrible world.	10
 Best Movie as of today	Shawshank Redemption would be my all time favorite as of now. It's more than a movie. It's a movie about hope and motivation.Thanks	10
 A Masterpiece of Hope, Friendship, Patience, Life, film-making & Performances by the entire Cast!	Shawshank Redemption made me feel the above TAGLINE when i first saw the film. It moved me even more when i saw it for the second time under different circumstances. Till now it still amazes me how this film can keep motivating me and my friends whenever we see the film again. That Explains it all. Short & true.	10
 A timeless masterpiece	Simply one of the best film out there and absolute not waste of your time	10
 Top	Loved how true this movie was to the original story.	10
 The BEST Movie You Might Have Missed	If you haven't watched Shawshank Redemption ,you have missed the best movie of all times.	10
 By far the best movie I have ever seen!	When I saw The Shawshank Redemption the first time, I've got to say I was a bit sceptic at first. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised! I have seen it countless times now and each and every time I see it, I am moved by how great a film it is! It has everything, it is simple, yet comprehensive. I completely agree with another review by User: speedreid, why this movie still hasn't received any Oscar is beyond my understanding!Best advise, set aside two hours and rent the film. I bet you will be moved, just as everybody else has been.	10
 extremely	If you are on a personal connection, like at home, you can run an anti- virus scan on your device to make sure it is not infected with malware.If you are at an office or shared network, you can ask the network administrator to run a scan across the network looking for misconfigured or infected devices.	9
 Best Plot I've Ever Seen On The Big Screen	I highly recommend that you guys go watch this movie and watch it at least 3 times back to back to fully understand the plot of it. The movie is very well written and has a very interesting and suspicious plot that makes the viewer want to watch multiple times making it a number 1 seller on the charts . I will definitely be seeking out more work from these directors , producers and screenwriters. Awesome Film!	9
 Do not lose hope in desperate moments.	There are many movies that deal with prison-related stories.It has already been 20 years since this movie came out, and it seems like I have already become accustomed to this story with similar movies. So, if you watch this movie right now, you do not seem to be impressed.The message that you should not lose hope in any situation seems to be an important motif in the movie. It is the same as before or now.PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good. ^^	7
 A true Classic	An absolutely incredible film, well worth watching. A truly amazing performance from the cast. The story follows all the 3 act structure in an incredible way. in terms of cinematography the shots are beautiful. I very much enjoyed this film and will most certainly be watching it again.	9
 Movie are really best	Really this movie is awesome and thanks for kapil chugh who provided best Internet service who help-full to watch movie without buffering. So we suggest all those India person who depend on internet one time try kapil chugh telecommunication services in India we sure that if you try one time you can't prefer other network your 1st choice is kapil chugh telecommunication.	8
 Increible	But Oldman also sinks deeply and empathically into Churchill's lower ebbs, projecting a sagging, load-bearing frailty and eloquence-sapping indecision we less readily associate with this semi- mythical figure. As foreign secretary Viscount Halifax (Dillane, once more compelling as a grey, rigid man of power) politically manoeuvres against him, we see Churchill flag and flounder. Not only is it impressive evidence of Oldman's dynamism and flexibility as an actor, it's also a timely reminder that world leaders should pause,	10
 A great movie! One of the best movies ever made!	The film is about a history of redemption, as the title says. The film has all the elements to be a classic and one of the best films ever made. the performances are perfect, bringing the feelings of the characters with mastery. The direction is something else that was made with all the love and affection of Frank Darabont, known for being the creator of The Walking Dead. The story, nothing more and nothing less made by the master Stephen King, is of excellence, the script well adapted with a touch of suspense, drama and comedy in some scenes. In the end, the film is one of the movies you should watch before you die.	10
 The Best film	"Stephen Fry identified as William Donaldson, a satirical article in Dictionary of national Celebrities own"" intelligent person, that person is stupid idea"". This ungenerous subtle reasoning, but in addition really quite true, Shawshank Payment can be described as a best film of people who feel overloaded."	10
 One of the best movies of all times	I've seen this movie recently on my TV and it really is one of the most underrated movies of all times for its time. It's become such a classic movie that we love to see on TV.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were elevated to the top with this movie. Their performances really is the thing that should be taught in film schools about how to build character interactions and character development.Loved this movie, I recommend it to everyone who hasn't seen it.	10
 A good film if u have naughty kids and u want to make them be good as teens AOL	Not a bad film and good to show u teens if they are not being good as I'm sure this film would make them think twice about miss behaving any more.not a bad film, seen it a few times now and when ever its on TV I watch it. Got a few sick bits in it.like when the blokes jump him in and do u no what.	7
 best movie in world	this movie is a fantastic. Because freedom is the most important thing, while innocent is imprisoned and you will be oppressed there.. and learn that you have to find your way.. and fight it. I thing if you don,t see this movie lose it. i started see movies by this film. this film have best Actors such as Morgan Freeman . his my love .	10
 Good	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	8
 One of the best movies ever.	This is easily one of the best movies ever made. The story is just absolute beautiful and the movie only leaves you wanting more. It truly broke my heart in to a million pieces but then picked them up and patched them back together. The cast of the movie fits perfect for the feelings you get for them, you both hate and love them at the same time.the beginning is engaging and makes you want more of the movie, i can truly say that this is one of the few movies that made never want to take a bathroom brake.	10
 Institutionalization, a very heavy .	A masterpiece ...Even a stone heart would melt after it runs its full length.Its amazing how the movie connects to you.Morgan is a gem, his narration gives you the feel.The movie is well edited and to the point (credits to the editor),like describing the first day in the prison,or to the scene where Librarian commits suicide to make us see what is institutionalization (yeah that word!!!). The movie grips you tight when Red starts to take the same path as another old man out of prison. You heave a sigh of relief when Andrew breathes free...	10
 Best movie i've ever seen	This is the one movie i watch, to get up if i'm sad or depressed. It's certainly the best movie i've ever watched.I think every good words that can be said about this movie already is said in the reviews here.Highly recommend everyone to watch this.	10
 What a movie!!!	Without doubt, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. No wonder that it is the top rated movie(at the moment). My advice is to watch the movie fully at the first time. You will never get the thrill when you watch it for the second time. The story line is astonishing and easily understandable. What a movie!!!	10
 Great Movie For Young Teens	This movie is such a heart felt movie and definitely something that will leave you thinking about yourself. This movie teaches you to persevere and keep going no matter how dark life gets to you; to look at the happy times in your most dark moments in life. A gut wrenching- screaming at the top of your lungs kind of movie.	9
 In the words of a friend	In the words of a friend of the most astounding and most memorable criminal films that will strike you up for 117 minutes with fears and fears ... It's a movie made by a German cinema that sparkles the world of its silent cinema With Metropolis, he is undoubtedly one of the best directors ever in the history of cinema ... apart from the unsurpassed play of actors such as killer actress (Peter Laura) ... decoupage, museums, decor, music, and the language and the language of each image. It's a masterpiece, and maybe this is the image of the long-awaited omen of the cinematic cinema that has been made for years for that film.	5
 An Iconic Landmark Film	The Shawshank Redemption 'Get busy living, or get busy dying.' (Darabont, 1994). These insightful words changed the cinema experience forever. In 1994, Frank Darabont released his ninth film, The Shawshank Redemption, just one of his cinematic triumphs. This film tells a story of an unlikely friendship between an innocent man Andy Dufrense, sentenced for two murders and a convicted murder, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding. Together they hope to one day become free men and experience life outside the prison walls. This is a film that touches every viewer's heart, a movie that has changed many lives. The Shawshank Redemption is renowned as being a landmark movie by association of the characters, crimes and confessions that played major roles in the film's success. The actors chosen for this film are one of the main reasons as to why this movie was so successful. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play the two leading roles throughout The Shawshank Redemption. As well as a main character throughout the film, Morgan Freeman also narrates a vast quantity of the film. Morgan Freeman won several awards for best actor and best supporting actor for his part in The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense, the innocent man wrongly jailed. The two characters become instantly believable from the first time they meet. Red bets 10 cigarettes that Andy will be the first to break, Andy however defies Reds statement. This bond becomes inseparable. The opening scene is of Andy being sentenced in a courtroom, the camera changes between Red in prison and Andy travelling to the prison until the two separate stories collide. The viewers meet Red and his mates and soon become emotionally attached. Together they grow to accept their fate and they battle the daily challenges that prison has to offer. Andy hides the secret that will change everyone's lives, until one night during a storm. Andy escapes from the Shawshank Prison through a hole, he takes the books containing the bank details from the warden. The cinematography excellence that is displayed constantly throughout this film is strongly displayed once Andy has finally escaped. The camera goes from being a low angle that follows Andy through the sludge to a high Angle allowing us to see Andy with his outstretched arms. This is quite possibly the most powerful scene in the entire film. Andy makes a new life for himself as Randall Stevenson. The Shawshank Redemption taught us all that there's more than meets the eye in everything we do. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the first movies to have an entire story line based off a successful prison escape. This film exposed what prison is actually like and how prisoners are treated. The Shawshank Redemption also debunked how you were guilty until proved innocent. Frank Darabont rids your imagination of what ifs and replaces it with when. The Shawshank Redemption uses the posters, given to Andy as presents from Red, to cover the hole that would ignite Andy Dufrense big escape. It is once that Andy has wriggled out of his prison cell one night that he finally has the chance to escape. With each clap of thunder, Andy strikes the sewage pipe with a rock until he finally breaks through, he then crawls for 500 yards through sewage. Andy Dufrense escapes the Shawshank prison to live a new life as Randall Stevenson. Although an iconic landmark movie, The Shawshank Redemption did not receive a single Oscar or Golden Globe. The film received 36 award nominations and went on to win 19 of these nominations. This stop motion picture was a box office success, making a profit of over $28 million. Having spent just $25 million of the making of this movie, the overall profit wasn't bad. The responses from this film were overwhelming positive. Many views stated the fact that this was a movie that will never be forgotten. And how although written by Stephen King, it is unlike any of his other cinematic triumphs. Frank Darabont did extraordinary job of replicating Stephen Kings Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The similarities between the book and the movie are defiantly a stand out, however there was one difference that stunned us all. Why did the movie and the book have different titles? Frank Darabont intentionally changed the name of the movie as he believed with the same name as the book, it would turn some people away. This was as a because of Rita Hayworth's name in the title, however Frank Darabont did completely rid the film of Rita. Instead he incorporated it into the film by it being the very poster that hides the hole that Andy escapes from. The Shawshank Redemption is a cinematic successful that has changed the film industry. The Shawshank Redemption is an iconic landmark film that has changed cinema forever. The characters, crimes and confessions from this film have changed the way we see daily objects. The actors chosen to partake in their roles did exceptionally well, making the film so successful. The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is never going to go out of style. It will forever remain in the forefront of viewers minds.	8
 Brilliant escape story	A brilliant story of a man who suffers through hell but perseveres and comes out on top in a world that seems stacked against him. The man is innocent and he knows this. He doesn't forget this. The warden of the prison he is interred in is a brutal character. He drives prisoners to the brink of sanity. Yet the protagonist befriends him and eventually this plays out against him and the protagonist achieves revenge on behalf of all the abused prisoners.The movie is rich in themes. It deals with friendship, suicidal thoughts, protest, abuse and perseverance.	10
 good	"It's Based on a Novella by Stephen King. The film is based on Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption,"" which was published in a short story collection called Different Seasons. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison."	10
 watch-movies.ga awful movie	Goonies is a never ending series of very loud, annoying and preposterous situations that will have you rolling your eyes more than a Felix the Cat clock. First and foremost, the continuous dialog and general noise in this movie is enough to make it a form of torture. The audio is pegged at 10 from the opening and never once lets up. Secondly, the gaps in reality: it's just a kids film you say? Movies like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars intelligently made a kids genre entertaining. Ditto to The Bad News Bears, Home Alone or anything Walt Disney Produced. This film bashes you over the head with every cliché and impossible situation imaginable. The characters are all one dimensional and unimaginative, most all of them have an adult wit and a snappy response for every thing posed to them like a kid from a bad sitcom, and I cannot stress this enough, all of them talk nonstop, mostly simultaneously, for the entire film.	10
 Jail House Break Out	This movie is all around excellent. The shots are great, the characters are great and of course Morgan Freeman kills it. A story of oneman trying to raise above it all and claim his freedom. Morgan Freeman narrates this movie and just like all his other work holds your attention from beginning to end.	9
 Great realization of a simple story	The actors and the production design are great. I was very touched from the development of the story. Be sure to watch, if not already done. A great example that the plot is not so important. A prison outbreak has already been filmed many times. I can recommend the film with a clear conscience.

 Best Cinematography of the 1990's	"Brooks' release from Shawshank is considered as one of the most brilliant moments in the Visual of Emotions. - Brooks, one of the oldest inmates at Shawshank is led out on parole after 50 years terrified at the prospect of freedom. Now, Pay attention to how the filmmakers visually communicate isolation .................... -In a sequence that ends with the words ""Brooks Was Here"" permanently etched into the very rafters from which he hangs, doesn't take Sherlock Holmes to deduce that this is a sequence about recognition of one's existence in an uncaring world or rather the lack thereof. Now, we've got the music, we've got the heart wrenching voice of narration, we've got James Whitmore's (Brooks) expressive face. But even if you take that all away, Frank Darabont (The Director) and Roger Deakins (The Cinematographer) are still saying something on the screen, and while we love the shot of an absurdly big halfway house room swallowing Brooks up in the Loneliness of too much space. And the shot of him hanging himself from a symbol so immediately obvious. I'm willing to break the rule of not dissecting symbols because films aren't Da Vinci Code ciphers, They're emotional experiences we're looking at. Which strikes his most clever is how Darabont and Deakins managed to make Brooks and us as the audience feel alone in a crowded space. -In a shot he's absolutely boxed in by background actors every single one of them is pointed away from him with their eye lines pointing outwards such that he is compositionally surrounded by their backs. In fact, this visual trope holds true for almost the entire sequence. You can see it when he was about to bump into a car and the man yelling at him in the car is kept off the screen. And established in the quite literal turning point when he left the prison. Another scene from the manager of the supermarket only turns his body towards him to scold Otherwise, It's all backs. And in the bus scene if we rotated the heads of the actors in the background towards Brooks. I mean it's not exactly a pleasant emotion, the actors all have relatively negative expressions but it's certainly not isolating or lonely anymore, we'd go with persecuting and accusatory and with a small edit we've changed this entire feeling of the scene in a single frame which says a whole hell of a lot about how much these little details can matter, we're not even focused on these other actors, you have to point us to an emotion in an instant which isn't always easy to do. In precisely staged images can be evocative of mostly nothing but carefully planned imagery can save volumes simply by something as simple as the way a person is pointed in the background which is exactly why I think Shawshank gets this moment exactly right."	8
 Utterly brilliant	I have the film on a firestick. Saw it originally at the cinema. Whenever I am depressed and fed up I watch it again I am probably up to 10 times now. A work of genius. The Mozart Nozze de Figaro one of the great scenes. But they are all great scenes. What more is there to say????	10

 Classic	Loved this one. Wonderful performance and hands-down filmmaking. Morgan Freeman was absolutely brilliant and Tim Robbins made his character look so real, it's impressive. It's a must watch for those who are done with the typical Hollywood movies. The cinematography and colouring is inspiring. We've been asked to learn from this film at our film school. Truly a pleasure to watch.	9
 The Value Of Freedom	An unmatched movie. I really missed this kind of movie. The story was excellent. Nowadays, it is very difficult to find such a work. Really surprising story of an ordinary man. When the life changed, people may find themselves different way of struggle. Coping with life change, how a man can find his aim in a different way. Human can fixed his freedom nothing stop him. A very successful scenario. I can say that the actors are indeed perfect.It's impossible to think of the end as you get trapped in the flow of Filmin. The result is really emphatic.	10
 worth watching	Very nice movie. I could not find any flaws. I was recommended again and again but I took long to watch The Shawshank Redemption. But later I decided that we all should trust rating giving by movie reviewers. I had seen trailer only and decided to watch the movie. But when I watched it then I said wow. What a movie.	10
 the best movie	One of the most beautiful movies I've ever watched. It changed my approach to cinema. I like movies. and it helped me to adopt it as a lifestyle. Story is flawless. Characters are perfect. Prison movies have always been interesting. But this film contains other goodies. Another movie I like was Papillon.	10
 90s movies are the best	In 2017 I watched this movie. I enjoyed every moment from the beginning to the end. Nowadays movies rely on effects more than stories and maybe very old movies depend on stories more. However, 90s movies have very good story and still with attractive effects. Unfortunately this movie wasn't successful in box offices, it deserves more credits.	10
 Super Movie, Love the Concept. A must watch one.	Super Movie, Love the Concept. A must watch one. Acting was fantastic. Interesting Story line. Cinematography was Excellent. This will be a lesson for Emerging film makers. Appreciate the Director for giving such a great movie. The scene in the Jail is great and wanna watch again. Great movie ever i watched. Thank you for this movie and Congratulations to the movie team.	10
 Shawshank Redemption Review	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.The perfect movie! Classic."	
 Excellent	Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red. Written by J-S-Golden	8
 My Favourite Movie Of All Time...		9
 A movie you need to see	This movie is one of my favorites It keeps you on the edge and you cant wait to see what's coming next, The director did a wonderful job on this movie. Morgan Freeman was incredible in the roles he played I could not rate this movie any lower and I must say hats off to the cast and crew well done and excellent script.	9
 good movie	"really good movie i recommend it After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong."	10
 Wonderful film	One of the greatest films i have watched the acting was pin point and everything transcended with the characters. i really enjoyed the objective and subjective analysis of each character because the actors portrayed them well. i would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is an actor or aspiring to watch this film a few times to see good acting	8
 Perfect!	Great movie! I am so picky in movies and so hard to find good movie nowadays. But The Shawshank Redemption one of the best Movies I've Ever Seen! The Ideas the Actors all in all perfect. They told me about it many years ago, you should watch it and I kept postponed it till one Friday I said I have to spare 2 and half hours to watch then voilà! Glad I've watched it.	10
 Are a goood	Story (10/10): The show is basically episodic and doesn't really have a story. The general concept was good enough to keep me intrigued though. It did offer some sort of introduction or back story to every new character presented each episode and some of the back stories were nice but really the focus of the show. If i have to say what was the main point of this show i would say it's the food first, the cultural exchange second and lastly the little interactions between characters and the bits of story offeredCharacters (7/10): Like i said the show is not really story driven so the characters didn't really have a lot of development. her.	
 One of the Best Inspirational movie to watch.	"This movie is one of the best movie to watch. Most Inspirational movie in my list. this movie is all about a men's loyalty and patience. the story of this movie is narrated by ""Morgan Freeman"" and he is the leading character of the movie. this movie feature in a jail. the other main character in this movie is Tim Robbins."	10
 Best movie you can ever seen	this is a movie where you will be emotionally hopeful. From my perspective its a masterpiece. a great storytelling with a top notch acting from all of the actors. I praise the director, story writer and everyone connected with this movie. one of the best movie of the century i have ever experienced.	9
" The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur."

Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods."	6
 There are no words	There are no words to describe this film. No matter how many times I have seen it, I always want to go back for more. I can't imagine any other title claiming a top spot! The whole idea of the film was excellently executed, acted superbly and produced by the best. If anyone has not seen this film, I will worry for them.	10
 Great Movie	This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967.	9
 Stupendo!	This is absolutely an amazing movie. It deserves the full 9/10! Despite being pretty dated it is still one of the best film I have ever seen. The end of the movie is really amazing. Recommended to all of you! This is absolutely an amazing movie. It deserves the full 9/10! Despite being pretty dated it is still one of the best film I have ever seen.

 After I saw it, I never stopped believing that everything was real.	12 years ago I registered a IMDb account for this one only movie ... I really do not know what happened but I can not find my review, well, so I decided to write another very short. Actually, I just want to say that it is for this film I love the seventh art. I was fascinated even before to know that there was a IMDb and then discover that it was qualified as the best. The performance of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is great. The spirit of this story is part of me.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever seen.	This one certainly is not with the best ranking, really the movie is spectacular protagonists of great commitment, the film thrills and Same time, do you know what you want? unfold history with apprehension. Congratulations to the history writer, Congratulations to the director and congratulations to the actors who are the best.	10
 Cinema at its finest	For me, The Shawshank Redemption has always represented the ideal movie. A stingy, irresistible, engaging story. A happy ending that does not mitigate the sadness and drama of the lives of the protagonists, but that seems only the fair reward for the suffering. And of course great direction and photography.	9
 Absolutely Awesome!	This is one of those movies that every time it's on I have to watch at least a bit of it! The way the story starts out with Andy handling that crazy situation, falsely accused and ultimately ending up in jail is unfortunate. Leading to some very dark and interesting situations with a variety of character types within the prison walls. There aren't many movies that can touch this one in terms of overall watchability!	9
 Amazing story about the strength of the human spirit	One of the best all time best movies! It is an amazing movie showing us that with patience and determination you can achieve anything. Also if you are into prison break movies this one is definitely a classic! It is an expression of the strength of the human spirit and an expression that time is the only barrier that is keeping us from achieving something if we never give up! Definitely worth 10 stars!	10
 Worth seeing - Marcus Everflod	I really liked this movie! /Marcus Everflod I can recommend this movie to you all. Adam Wiberg is tired all the time. But I liked it. He is sleeping. It seems as we don't like the same kind of movies. Adam likes romantic movies and stuff like that. I'm more into action and thriller movies.	8
 The Philosophical Depth is Deep	"This film really has the philosophical hat on its head - especially that of Existentialism. It explores beautifully the idea that we make our own meaning in this world, and that being given an essence by others - the prison, jailers, and the satanic warden in this case - really deprives us of basically what makes us human, our ability to make choices. Andy's escape can be seen as a metaphor for the acceptance of existentialism and of making your own choices - using one's radical freedom as Jean Paul Satre would put it. While Red serves as a loose representative of the idea of essentialism. I feel ambivalent about the famous quote from this film which goes, ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" I am not sure I agree. But in my own way, I can see the idea behind it. Hoping is a sure cause for suffering, and mastering that suffering - as Friedrich Nietzsche would say - is the roadway to happiness. The people who can't endure this suffering may not be all that admirable - Red, for instance. It is maybe Andy's endurance and mastering of his suffering that makes him admirable and compelling as a protagonist. The redemption in the title is symbolic of the release of inauthentic and externally imposed meaning, and the act of embracing authentic meaning. In short, this film is one of those films that get you thinking about life; it has all the entertainment, symbolism, and Philosophical depths that you could need to make the most of your time. It's definitely worth it!"	10
 Film that you must watch	"This legendary film, made in the same year I was born (1994), tells the story of Andy. Andy apparently is a normal guy, with a good career, a lovely wife and a well paid job. But suddenly all the things change when the main character of the film discovers that his wife has cheated on him and the police find Andy's wife killed next to his lover. For that reason Andy is supposed to be the killer and Morgan Freeman plays the role of the narrator of the story of Andy (a normal and introverted man) in prison. So as you can see this film has a good plot, with legendary actors as are Tim Robbins (playing the role of Andy) and Morgan Freeman (playing the role of Ellis Boyd ""Red"" the narrator and ringleader of the prison). Apart of that, this classic film, is a realistic story that could happen in real life with an unbelievable end."	9
 I never knew until yesterday that Stephen King wrote the short story.	Somehow, I missed this film the first go around. Very impressed.....I only hope that prisons have improved in the last 70 years....but I fear they have not. This is a cautionary tale for any person hell bent on going to prison. Rise up and do some good where you are standing. It is a long, bleak, lonely time in prison.	10
 Loved this movie	One of the best films. The actors take you for a wild ride where you will laugh, cry and be down right angry. The story line is so well done. It follows the book which I was very happy with. It's just one of those movies you put on and love it every time you watch it. This will be one of those movies that will always be on my top 10 list.	10
 I cry every time	basically the best film I've ever seen and if you haven't then you're missing out on a whole lot of pop culture references. from start to finish i'm an emotional wreck. every character is well developed and complex and honestly you don't find many films like this anymore. it's got some funny moments, some heartbreaking, and some painfully distressing ones, but the story is told in such a beautiful way you can't not like this film. sorry to be part of the hype, but it's the most highly rated film for a reason!	10
 wow....		10
 Interesting Movie	Interesting plot to watch. One of movie that capable to make you to buy from Movie Store.The starting of the story is already enough to give impact (even tho it quite slow). However, it change when it reach of its peak. The tone change until it reach climax. As viewer, who already repeats watching for years, i recommend this movie to watch again and again. The starring are awesome, the character are awesome. Worth to watch and buy copy at video store.	9
 Is it possible to doubt that this is a masterpiece?	The film is excellent. From the outset, you penetrate to the main character, because you feel that he is innocent, it is difficult for him to go to jail and for experiencing it. Morgan Freeman acts as a classical sage who helps Andy not fall into the abyss. Escape for now dirty and unpleasant, it is perceived as an attempt to get out of the darkness into the light through the mud and the final purification by the rain is delivered genius.	10
 Great Film	Great Film with a series of events that were expected yet surprising. I really enjoyed watching this film as it is come across as a classic these days. If you haven't seen this film yet I suggest you rent it or check it out on Netflix. Its an iconic jail film with a lot of replay- ability to it. It also has some educational value as well. For the most part i think all the actors played there parts fabulously.	7
 fantastic	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.	10
 Lives up to its reputation	Does this film provide a faithful rendition of the book?This movie is adapted from Stephen King's novel It would be fair to claim that this masterpiece is one of the best novel adaptations of all time. The drama inevitably has a strong impact upon the emotions of the audience.The story is narrated by Red (played by the inimitable Morgan Freeman), a long term resident of Shawshank prison. Among the recent inmates, one stands out - Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who appears to be innocent. Andy has a surprising peaceful personality based on his unanimity and inner strength.This film tells how two people who serve life imprisonment eventually became friends and find ways to overcome the depths of despair.	9
 Best movie I have ever watched.	I have seen this movie and I am really impressed by both the lead actors Freeman and Tim. One thing that I want to say about this movie is that this movie has the everything that a viewer want to look i.e creativity, emotion, message, feel. I really loved this and this movie deserves this rating.	10
 A Classic!	Has to be my all time favourite film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both tanlented actors.The plot is so cleverly written and does the novel justice. Stephen King is one of my favourite writers and i hope he's proud with the job Robbins and Freeman did.There's not much more i can actually say that hasn't been said already.	10
 One of the Unique Movie	I had never experience this kinda realness and sharp unique movie. Absolutely Fantastic with everything story line, acting and everything it just stick to your thoughts for a long while.

 Extraordinarily awesome	"The story is portrayed in a very subtle but in a gripping way that will keep you glued to the seats. Though you will kind of predict what would happen but you would never imagine the way it would happen.The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work.Awesome screenplay and acting."	10
 Freeman	"The Shawshank Redemption is about a Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy learns to get by in the brutal confines of prison, even earning the respect of his fellow inmates, most notably the long time convict ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). While being an R rated film I didn't feel like it was an R rated film. I mean there were some scenes, other than that it could've been rated a PG-13, but it's not up to me. The Drama/Crime film was surprising on first view but in the best world, I literally watched it straight after I watched for the first time, although it does have a running time of 142 minutes. It was well worth it. I now know some of the most iconic scenes ever in film history, I knew them before but I never understood until I watched it for the first time. I think one of the most touching and in terms of the film itself, one of the biggest scenes was the death of Brookes. I wasn't able to handle it, you know that feeling you get when you're watching a film and you can kind of guess what's about to happen but you don't want it to happen, so you're sat there like no, no, no, no, no, you know? In the film it becomes clear that the prison is corrupt with inside deals and businesses going on, it is also revealed to the audience that the prison does not follow the prison standards of the state and that it does what it wants. Such as, when on the first night Andy is in his cell and all of the other prisoners tell him and are talking about who there is always one who cracks first, it turns out to be a guy only a few cells away from Andy, we then see how the guards deal with the situation in a sarcastic manner and how they blatantly don't care at all, as they proceed to actually club the guy to death. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison. . We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space. There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom. The last act, in which Andy helps Red accept his freedom, is deeply moving - all the more so because Andy again operates at a distance, with letters and postcards, and is seen through Red's mind. Roger Deakins' cinematography is tactful, not showy. Two opening shots, one from a helicopter, one of prison walls looming overhead, establish the prison. Shots follow the dialogue instead of anticipating it. If you have not seen this film, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!?!?!?!!? Follow me on Instagram @gabewatling and Twitter @gmwatling"	10
 What a wonderful movie	The cinematography in this one is one of the best i've ever seen, soo good you don't even recognize it.Its one of the best Sunday evening movies and always a rush of emotions. Everyone that now hasn't seen the movie should watch it straight through	
 A world class film.	It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime. The cast and the story of the movie are really successful. Andy is a passionate character, and he is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. It is so touching to spend almost two decades in the prison. Old-fashioned prisons in the 90s are full of bad guy who don't expect anything from the life. And , they don't think how we escape here. However; Andy with his close friend in the prison , Red , tries redemption from this prison, by the time , Andy tries to do beneficial things for people in the prison not to attract attention. It is unbelievable that they escape from this prison. But , Andy approaches to place of exit. It is actually amazing , it is really incredible. They go to their dreams to live a peaceful and quiet life. Also; Andy prepares a trap for the chief of the jail. After the redemption , they become free anymore. It is really an amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!	10
 Ronald's Review	Shawshank Redemption is phenomenal.The acting is superb and the story telling through the writing does not disappoint. The character development of each character was also beautifully written. If I had to rate this film I would give this a 10 out of 10.This hands down goes down as one of my favorites of all time.	
 One of the worlds best story , having us seeking more.	Though I've seen the film many times , its a film which doesn't have me gaining a dislike towards it no matter the number of views I've made.the story never has a moment of boredom and if anyone can id be interested to know how. character placement and development work well together and equal true perfection. to think the character Red killed an individual , and we route for this character shows how clever this film is as to change our views on someone with a dark past is a motion picture of perfection.	10
 love this movie!	this movie was one of my favorite movies ever since childhood. I used to watch it with my mom when I was younger and we would talk for hours about the ending. one of my favorite movie subjects has to be prison escape or escape in general. I love the suspense and frustration and the feeling you get when the protagonist finally comes up with a good plan and you really think he/she is going to do it and then the feeling after he/she does it and gets away with or doesn't.	8
 Dis	Amazing movie.Although my friends and many other people suggested me to watch this movie, it was only after I watched this movie that it became my favorite movie ever. It teaches you that HOPE can get you out of any hell of a situation. The friendship between Andy and Red is another best thing in this movie.The best feel good movie ever made. The friendship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is flawless and inspiring. It gives a beautiful message about not loosing hope even in the toughest of times.	10
 Do not see the greatness	This movie is good but it is so highly ranked that i do not understand why. It seems like for people who do not watch that many movies or at least older movies. Cool hand Luke has similarities to this film which by the way Cool Hand Luke was much better. I just do not see what everyone else sees, this is not even Stephen king best adaption for a movie.If you seen a movie before 1990 and still this is your favorite please tell me why	7
 The Shawshank Redemption - A treat to watch		10
 Very insightful and meaningful movie	Undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen. The direction, acting, sets and script were beyond my expectations and extremely gripping and deep into the emotions of the characters as if I there witnessing the scenes. I highly recommend anyone to see this movie if you haven't seen it especially those who enjoy a really great movie.	10
 Movie to be watched.	This is the movie to be watched for 100 percent. Take time and watch it. You never forget it. so inspiring. one of those which you think about it deeply even after finishing watching the movie. I watched it for four times and every time I was inspired even more than before. Don't miss it.	10
 Hope	If you're looking for hope in this world then you must watch this movie 🎥 🍿. This movie deserves to be one of the best movies of all time with no doubt and it has a very deep meaning other than the story it self is magnificent and that is obvious cause it's written by STEPHEN KING. Just enjoy	10
 A movie that will never be forgotten and must be watched :)		10
 Shawshank Redemption Review	"Excellent Movie! It was great to see Andy Dufrane get to live his life in the end, without obstruction. He was determined to make the ""system"" work in his favor by the end of the movie. This movie is a great learning tool for young adults, as well. The moral of the story was one of tenacity."	10
 Brilliant movie	This movie is about having hope and perseverance in the darkest of times. When everything fails, there is no one to help, it is you who can help you. You can actually fell the struggle, frustration, opportunity, despair which the characters are having. Excellent acting by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and team. The Director has made a masterpiece film which will be appreciated for generations.	10
 Prison is Awesome	Well, not always, but THIS prison is awesome. I've been to real prison in Ireland and England and spent a few months in jail in southern France. Not long terms, mind you but enough to get a good first hand understanding of what life is like behind bars. If I had to be locked up for 20 years I don't think I'd mind being in Shawshank. You make lifelong friends, get a little beatdown action with the guards, drink some tasty cold brews on the roof with your buds, build a library, listen to Italian opera and go to movies with the guys, dig holes for escaping. It's the schit. Shawshank fukken rocks bro. This is possibly the best film I've ever seen. I hope if I ever go back to prison (and chances are good) I hope it's exactly like Shawshank, only I'd want to have some chicks so it would be like a co-ed prison. Maybe a chick warden too. Mmmm. Yummy wild ass prison bictches. Haha bro. I'm actually looking forward to my next incarceration.	10
 Awesome	Best ever! This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. this film is fairly long. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit drawn out, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline was a bit unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen.	10
 Outstanding Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a definitely a film worth seeing. In my opinion this movie is one of the best movies which was ever made. I would not say that it's bound to be a box-office hit, because it was made at the same year as the smash hits such a Pulp fiction or Forest Gump. Regardless of not being so successful as the two mentioned movies at Oscars, The Shawshank Redemption still occupies the first places of the lists of the best rated movies all over the world and, of course, it is certainly at the top of my list.	
 A solid film for all types of people	"This might be the ""best"" movie of all time, considering how real and unexaggerated it is and most importantly, that the viewership is so broad. It's a normal film that everyone of all ages and sizes can enjoy.Interesting characters, great atmosphere and a real and relatable story. Similar things have happened to all of us on maybe a minor level but I could relate a lot to Andy and his situation. The most important ""must watch"" movie out there. Go see it!"	10
 One of the best movies of all time!	I have seen this film too many times to count and every time I do I am still just as blown away as the first. Stellar cast, clear storytelling, with a unique perspective. I believe everyone should add this film to their must watch list. The world needs more movies of this quality.	10
 review	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption, I am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption and other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.	10
 Best of Bests	This is the movie that I (truly) realized the word of 'Hope'. If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment.	10
 awesome movie	I am not a reviewer to write about this movie but i am a huge of the movie. The movie has a feel to it which i cant explain even after seeing it for many times .Still fresh after many watches best movie ever. Tim Robbins,Morgan Freeman steal the show with their performances.	10
 I absolutely loved this movie	I completely recommend this movie to everyone there is a bit of language but I didn't mind I found the story interesting and moving I liked watching the evolution of Andy throughout the years (I.e. new haircut or outfit) sometimes the movie almost brought me to tears when Brooks couldn't handle being outside of Shawshank. Totally recommend this movie watch it!	10
 Great Movie	I have officially watch this movie four times and every time the story line get to me, love it. The cast, director and producers awesome job.I write a lot of stories from i was in high school, never took my writing serious after school. I went into teaching, then hospitality, then computers. After watching 'The Shawshank Redemption' and seeing how the writers did the story board, i wanted to pick back up my writing with the goal of one day delivering on a big stage as this.	9
 Good but there's better	Whilst I respect the opinions of others and enjoy reading a variety of contrasting reviews, I find it surprising that the Shawshank Redemption has been voted the greatest film of all time.I enjoyed watching this film and feel that the story is generally good and the cast is excellent, resulting in distinct and complex characters whilst providing an interesting insight into the mentality and inter- relationship of prisoners and guards. However, I don't feel that the story was challenging, the concept is not particularly original and borders cliché when considering other prison films, the film is, in my view, unnecessarily long and, crucially, I didn't like the ending.I do feel that this is still a very good film, however there are other films, indeed other prison films, which are better than this one.	7
 Amazing story	This film exactly a deep message, I love the story and the feeling. I am watched this film a bit late in 2001, but I love to watch again. Amazing story with and actors.If I know right the film was built on one of Stephen King novelette. It has an incredible powerful positive message that we will always need.	10
 Awesome		10
 One of the best movies I saw.	I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic storyline keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch.	10
 Everyone's favorite movie	Well it is hard to see anyone talking about his favorite movies and not mentioning THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and it really deserve it.... a movie about freedom and determination about friendship . also it fits every taste in cinema I guess that's why it got its reputation . One of the best ever ..... Really	9
 Unforgettable film Ever	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known among st his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.	9
 Love	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?	9
 The heartbreaking story of a man deprived of his liberty	I put the film 10 stars for the following reasons: 1) The ratio of actors to their acting is excellent. 2) The atmosphere at the level. Immerses in a prison gloomy world. 3) Well thought out plot. 4) Lack of interest, while watching the movie, did not appear. 5) Accompanying the film with music on the level. 6) The film did not cause me a negative or disgust, but rather inspired. 7) The film has a deep meaning, you can get it by having certain life beliefs (in my personal opinion). The film is definitely worth a look. For each there is useful information.	10
 changed my life...	this movie changed my life...its very emotional,motivating,inspiring...and makes me feel grateful...it will be stay in my heart forever...i don't think any other movie can take place of this movie even in future...there's not enough words to express my emotions...and i cant explain anymore...	10
 A film to see.	One of the best film ever, using every old cinema good uses. Best to watch, seen it many times !Every body should see this film once time in their life.Good actors, good place to shoot, a captive story line.So many beautiful shoots, good music, from the beginning to the end it was a immersive film.	10
 Ultimate Story of Determination..	Had watched this movie many years ago. Don't remember the whole story but the only thing which comes in my mind about this movie is unbelievable determination shown by the lead actor to come out of the prison..This movie made me realize that nothing is impossible in life.. If we are determined and committed to our goal, anything could be achieved. No matter how hard it is..	9
 Awesome	The Shawshank Redemption is my all time favorite movie. All the star cast acted very well. Their expressions is what I loved most about this movie. It is one of the greatest films of the 1990s. Story is good. Among all the characters of this movie, I liked Andy Dufresne most because of his impressive role. I loved this movie again and again.	8
 best old movie all time	i really enjoy watching this movie, cool story the actor was great, but it is kinda boring on the middle, if you watch this movie, don't watch it with high expect according to good review and score, watch it and enjoy the showUsually I do not like watching old movies because I watch movies by enjoying the visuals, but this movie is different	9
 Fantastic movie!		9
 2 men teach other about survival inside and out of prison		10
 Master Piece!	A Master Piece! Nothing can be better than that. Story, Drama, Emotions, Suspense everything was there and perfectly decorated! A must watch at least Twice! The cast has been picked very carefully and the roles assigned to them have been perfectly played. The End, its incredible and pretty unpredictable. Hats off to the writer, director, actors and the entire team.	10
 Awesome movie	best movie i watched ever. I had most trouble believing were not the way the criminal always barely escapes, not the story or the era or the feel of the movie, but that Cusack's character had any feelings at all. He seemed apathetic and occasionally angry. That was it. And that made the film, a good film overall, not be better than average.	10
 Shawshank Came to Define Cinema of the 90s.		10
 Love this Movie	Just a awesome movie. Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film. Thanks...	8
 Amazing film	One of the best films ever. The rating of this film could not be more fitting. Just talking about a film like this makes me want to rewatch it. This film lesson on hope, incredible acting, amazing script, great soundtrack are what make it deserve the top 5 spot for me. Its amazing and never met anyone who did not love the movie. I would recommend it to anyone.	9
 I like this movie like everybody.	This movie has changed my opinion about life and I believe it will change a lot of people's life. I think everybody must watch this movie. Because they will get to know the difference between guilty and innocent. And they will decide which is important. Innocence, guilt, honesty.	10
 Watch this movie!!!	This movie is one of my all time favorite's and if you haven't already seen it WATCH IT!! Excellent acting, excellent script, excellent plot and excellent story line (I know there are a lot of excellent's in this review but it is the only word that comes to my mind when writing this review) I would recommend this movie to everyone (Over age 15 of course).	10
 A timeless classic	This movie is an absolute classic. I remember the first time I saw it when I was a little kid and I have seen it so many times. Great actors as well. Terrific plot development and the movie never seems to get old. This is the way that movies should be made and unfortunately there are not enough new movies coming out that have the same old school, classic feel of this gem. I highly recommend this movie to everyone out there!	10
 A must watch	It was after I heard a lot of friends tell me what a great movie this is, that I decided to finally watch it. I must say it is not a movie but an experience. Really like the way how the story progresses and concludes. Excellent performances that result in characters leaving a mark in memory. A movie that I watch once in every 6 months.	10
 A remarkable film that portrays bravery and determination!	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are incredible in the fascinating motion picture The Shawshank Redemption. The film is a tremendous demonstration of bravery and brotherhood and one that could satisfy everyone. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is serving two life sentences at Shawshank prison for murder that he did not commit. Throughout the film, the audience is exposed to Andy's hardships, friendships, successes, and failures. One particular friendship that is extremely significant is the one Andy forms with Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). The theme of having hope is brilliantly illustrated throughout the entire film. Andy never gave up and fought a tremendous battle for 19 years in Shawshank prison for the crime he knew he did not commit. Can you imagine being locked up for a brutal 19 years for something you did not do? Equally as compelling as Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life (1946), The Shawshank Redemption will be sure to make you appreciate life in a beautiful way that you never knew you could. The positivity that radiated off of Andy is something that makes this film so inspiring and heartfelt. The filming techniques used in Shawshank are as influential as they are fitting. A motif from the film I would like to elaborate on is the crow. This crow was a companion to one of the prisoners by the name of Brooks. Just moments before Brooks (James Whitmore) is released from prison, he releases the crow. This illustrates that Brooks has a major lack of hope that he will make it in life after he is released. In fact, it is written all over his face because prison is all he has ever known. Another technique I would like to discuss is sound. Perhaps the theme is most successfully portrayed when Andy blasts opera music over the load speaking throughout the entire prison. The look on his face and the look on the other prisoner's faces is truly priceless.This is by far my favorite scene in the film! I cannot get enough of this film and I enjoy watching people experience it for this first time. This film was recommended by my mother and father for me to watch approximately 8 years ago and I have been hooked ever since. I give this movie the 10/10 that it deserves for all of the life lessons it teaches and the hope it evokes. Overall, The Shawshank Redemption will keep you locked in, surprised, and intrigued throughout!	
 Loved it!	This film is a truly great once i had started watching it i couldn't get my eyes of the screen. From start to finish this movie was amazing and i loved every second of it. Definitely one of my top 10 favorite films of all times it is a must watch. I recommend that everyone sees this movie.	10
 Excellent Film	This is one not to miss. I was also shocked to learn that this was written by Stephen King! The acting is superb and the ending is fantastic. It's not your typical prison film but has heart and depth beyond the normal Hollywood picture.If I were to venture out on a limb, this is almost a perfect film.	10
 Incredulous	IMDb reviews... where to start. You'll start off thinking that Fight Club and Shawshank Redemption are the pinnacle if you're new to American cinema. But that's just not how it is. Seriously, if you haven't noticed that, your IQ couldn't possibly exceed 80. If you write an IMDb review in earnest, for example, about Shawshank Redemption being super awesome, you may want to be assessed for possible brain damage. Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, it was good. The obstacles faced by the protagonist brought tears to my eyes more than once, I really was moved by his plight. But is it the best movie out there today? Probably not. Not in my opinion. It's worth a watch, but not at the level that the brain dead morons who rate films on IMDb will have you believe. Think for yourself.	8
 favorite movie!	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	7
 Cant find a better movie than Shawshank!	"Let me just start by saying if you think this movie might not be for you, just watch it. Actually, when I was in the 7th grade my friend and I visited the Mansfield Reformatory (just because we wanted to see if it was haunted) unknowing my soon to be favorite movie was filmed there. Fast forward a year and everything I had heard on our tour of the Mansfield Reformatory about how awesome Shawshank Redemption was, I finally found out.The movie is not something I would typically watch but the story is just incredible. Andy, one of the main actors is a banker and sentenced for the supposed ""murder"" of his wife. Andy goes through for lack of better terms complete hell until he finds his place within the prison and plans to escape because he is truly innocent. Throughout Andy's journey in the prison, you feel as if you are stuck there with him. His frustrations are your frustrations and you wish you could prove his innocence. Through various factors such as sound, lighting, the location (Mansfield Reformatory), and actors have you glued to the screen seeing if Andy can escape. I won't give too much more away for this amazing film but please just watch it, I promise you will not be disappointed."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		9
 it's a great movie	I liked this movie very much I've watched it several times it is great one and make you live in Action and Fantasy . it will take you to another imagination world Morgan Freeman played a good role and he fits this role I wish I could watch it another time but I have not much time .	10
 about film	"excellent film.The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation."	10
 IMDb numbers say all!		9
 Exceptionally Good	In a life time, at least once, you must watch this fantastic movie. I really liked it to my heart. I was so impressed with how every single scene was given a great deal of respect and attention from the ace director. The movie has a great and deep message that everyone should take it as positive in our lives	10
 Excellent Movie, You will see your life in a different perspective!	There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. I love that movie. I always fall asleep at any movies. But this one, was one of the best and I have watched it over 10 times. You really have to see it. Enjoy! :D	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	I knew something about this movie before I watched it. So I have had really high expectations. After just few minutes my expectations were overcome by the storytelling. This movie is based on an amazing storyline strengthened by incredible casting. There was no moment I would feel bored or simply just not interested. The Shawshank Redemption really got me a easily became my all time top movie. I do not think I will see something that marvelous ever again. 10/10 (100%)	10
 This film is about a man wrongly accused of a crime he did not commit.	The film brings you to a place and time that few of us will ever think about. It holds the truth in some way we care about life. The main character takes on struggles with a world few of us could ever imagine. The actors portray the roles they are given without doubt giving us an illusion that can make fantasy a reality. The story is told is such a way that , a picture is painted inside our head.	9
 Totally worth it	This movie deserves the top10 no question about that, well acted and well written, i mean there is Morgan Freeman so you know you're in for a treat. The twist is unexpected and you will love it. I would be impressed to see someone dislike this movie, you're hooked from start till the end and who knows you might see it multiple times like I did. Totally recommend this movie for everyone.	
 I loved this movie	The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies. It's #1 on the all-time IMDb ranking, so that should tell you something. It's just an all around good movie. The story is compelling, the acting is great, and Morgan Freeman does the narration. You can't really ask for much more from a movie.	
 Very Good	The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie so blah this hen mom the Stephan King ugh ghost really good movie you should watch it Morgan Freeman is in it and its a good movie i don't know what I'm doing you already know what this movie is and this wont help you just go see I'm just writing this because i need to write a first review	10
 A movie worth admiring	Rich content of this layered masterpiece with perfect time line will bring you to the prison life of 50s. Personally, I consider The Shawshank Redemption best adaptation of Kings novel ever. Superb cast of Robbins and Freeman under the leadership of Frank Darabont gave us cult classic. This movie is on my top 10 movies ever list. Further, I find this movie my view changing movie as I was deprived of personal unjustifiable hate to Crime genre. A movie worth admiring	9
 Number 1 for a reason!	It's one of my favorite movies, the all-time 'guy movie' (but all genders should love it), a show of friendship, loyalty, love of freedom and, above all, love of life in freedom. And who could tell a story better than Stephen King, the number one story-teller in residence? And who else practically exhales humanity if not Morgan Freedman as Red Redding? Add Tim Robins as the mysterious and never tired of living Andy Dufresne and it's a movie that at least I keep watching over and over again.	10
 My all Time Favorite Movie!	This movie is the best! I have watched it more times than I can count and each time I watch it I enjoy it like it was the first time. My favorite scene in the movie is where they are tarring the roof of the plate factory. Fantastic actors! Great story! The best of the best in my opinion!	10
 Legend no less	One of the very best but a bit boring at times though in the end it doesn't really matter. The casts were good, the script was good, all in all a legendary masterpiece. This movie has turned some action loving freaks into drama/thriller psychos (thanks to me). My advice, if you haven't seen this movie, take some medicine so that you can stay awake during the entire period but once you have finished, you will be awake for the rest of your life.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful picture brimming with an uncompromising heart and melancholy		10
 Everyone should see it.	The film is about justice, but, as is often injustice of the court. The film is about a friendship that can help when there is no reason to live. The film, I'm not afraid of this word, is a masterpiece! I watched it many times and I will look again and again. He can not get bored. It's not just a movie, it's a state you're immersed in ... This is one of my favorite movie. I really recommend anyone see it. The ambiance, the quality of actor's playing is amazing!	10
 Good Movie	One of the best movies which I have seen. Ending was the great. I will highly recommend this movie. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.	10
 One of the top movies of all time...	What can I say? This movie has all the makings of what true cinema are: Drama, suspense, a little bit of comedy and nearly every other emotion known to man. I have watched this movie probably nearly 30 times over the years and it never gets old. I would rate this personally in my top 25 films of all time. This is film making at it's finest. And if you are one of the few Americans out there who has not seen this movie at some point, I promise you won't be disappointed!	9
 Almost a perfect movie.	The Shawshank Redemption will keep you on the edge of your seat. We journey with the main character as he finds his way around his new home in prison. There are many lessons learned but we see a small light at the end of the tunnel. If you enjoy true cinema, you will enjoy this story.	10
 The story begins with the trial of a young banker	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	
 Superb Movie	This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!	10
 Great Movie!!	A great Movie to watch with your friends and family. I do recommend!! a plus... the director has given everything you need for a full satisfaction. Life is not the same without watching this beautiful story of friendship and control. Patience is a virtue... life will go on!	9

 Superb , superb and superb but...	One of the phenomenal movie I have ever seen. Absolute brain blowing end ! Although end could be less happier!Awesome things :* Real wisdom from freeman * Patience of prisoners. * Real face of prisons and authority. * StrategyMaybe irritating :* Too much happy at end.	9
 Worth watching!	The movie has many dialogues that will make the viewers rethink about their lives. Not the best movie I've ever watched, but still is one of the best movies. The movie is a bit long. But considering the fact that it was released long before current time, it is not an issue. I'd recommend anyone to watch this movie.	9
 Best Film of All Time	This Film is a Masterpiece; Personally I think this is the greatest film of all time, The Acting is great, Thomas Newmans Musical Score is terrific, one of Morgan Freeman's best performances and the villain (The Warden) is really good one of the top movie Villains ever. I have no negatives with this movie and that is extremely rare and I tried to look for a negative and I couldn't find one with this Film. Best Stephen King adaptation Film to date and check this Film out if you haven't seen it.	10
 One of kind Film Ever Made	Iam digital intermediate Colorist by Profession operating out from India (mumbai),been associated with movies,commercials,music videos,My sensibility towards film making is different from mediocre people,for me The Shawshank Redemption film is one of kind film ever made,produced,directed,cinematography,scripted. Directed by Frank Darabont Produced by Niki Marvin Screenplay by Frank Darabont Based on Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King Starring Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman Bob Gunton William Sadler Clancy Brown Gil Bellows James Whitmore Music by Thomas Newman Cinematography Roger Deakins Edited by Richard Francis-BruceAll this above mention credits to film have done stupendous job to create a Legend film.	10
 Truly a masterpiece !		10
 Redemption lies within	A simple story of life in prison that has clearly depicted how events can turn for those that have hope and never give up to fight for their lives to the end. Best movie that has shown how life is in prison and how men struggle to survive the torture that happens to them both physically and psychologically. Through time the movie will live to be the greatest.	10
 Awesome	There is little point in even trying to write anything detailed since everything that needs to be said has been said in all the previous reviews, but such was the impact that this film made with me that feel obliged to at least have my tuppence worth. This film has me transfixed from the get go - and had me exhausted by the end of it. Robbins and Freeman were simply superb in their roles, with an exquisite plot line to match. If anyone reading this has yet to watch this movie ....... hurry up and give yourself a treat !!	10
 Movies	"Nice movies Chief and Producer Emilio Ferrari's past credits incorporate Baby on Board with Heather Graham, Lucky Town with Kirsten Dunst, White-Out, and ""Ensnarement."" The film was likewise created and co-composed by Hollywood newcomer Zachary Swerdlow.About Entertainment 7 Entertainment 7 is a completely operational Multinational Media Company, with its primary workplaces in Los Angeles, California and satellite workplaces in London and Rome"	5
 You should get a new version of this movie.	Shawshank Redemption movie is the best prison movie all the time. You should get a new version of this movie. This movie is a marvel. She teaches life. If you think about something, it teaches you to do it in 20 years, not in 600 years. If we have friends who have not watched a movie, I recommend watching them.	
 Top 3 best movies ever	Shawshank is one of the best prison movies other than green mile if you haven't seen it where have you been Morgan freeman at his best if you haven't seen it stop what you are doing and watch it...thank me later you wont be disappointed What you still reading this for... Go go go Still here huh	10
 Only movie i can give an honest 10/10	This film is the second time that James Whitmore (who plays Brooks in this film) plays an incarcerated character who fears release. The first, was The Twilight Zone episode: On Thursday We Leave For Home (1963)Made me cry nonstop. This has to go down in my top 5 best movies of all time	
 The Perfect Movie	A story of justice. A person, imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, finally escapes, starting a new life for himself.Brutal in places, portraying the life inside a tough American prison, this film has it all. It's a story of friendship, with possibly the greatest ending of all time. A must for all movie fans.	10
 good movie	What a superb film. I am what you call a cinefile. That is someone who loves movies to the extreme. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Some inappropriate things, but it's real.My favorite movie of all time. It has many famous iconic quotes. Get busy living or get busy dying!	10
 Really well	I liked it very much, very elaborate plans and an excellent distribution. The Interpretation of the protagonists is detailed and neat, so that These have a lot of depth. As for the plot thread, do not It leaves the eyes of the screen for a single moment. The Locations are very varied and the art direction fills the Scenarios leaving them perfect for interpretation. In general Spectacular and very Tarantino.	7
 Worth a good watch	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare films, where you can tell from the opening credits, the first chords of the soundtrack and the first voice-over line from Morgan Freeman, that you're about to witness a movie of exceptional quality. It's Beautiful, Moving and has an Amazing score."	9
 Time Is Of The Essence	This is my favorite movie. A true story of never giving up, Keeping hope alive and having faith. Just when you think it's over. That little light at the end of the tunnel shines on you. This story also reminds me of some people I know. Who kind of live in the prison of the mind, that's why I always tell people no matter what. Never give up	10
 Masterpiece just simple as that	Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman did excellent work on acting, it gave me really good feeling how they play the role. Strong message is really important & i thing this movie just give me more then that. James Whitmore was also into hes character, nice job.Strong message & good acting is good foundation in movie & good smart execution can give viewer so much joy. One the best movies in 90's. Frank Darabont did magnificent work to as director, many people cant pull this kind work of art at no where. Writer Stephen king well what you can expect for this mans work, he is mastermind when comes to writing & creating a characters which are open to feelings & ideas. It wasn't only movie it was full of philosophy & strong ties which can't broke no matter what. Movie give also good calm scenes to express. I recommend to watch this movie its gonna give you more then that.	10
 Amazing!	One of the BEST movies I have ever seen simply amazing! I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director and crew. The acting was out of this world. I have never seen Tim Robbins act so well. The twists were unexpected, and although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original.	9
 actually a really good film	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. it slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	8
 Amazing movie	This is one of those movies that you have too watch at least once in your life. It is not predictable nor it has an ending that disappoints everyone, it is simply perfect! Morgan Freemans acting is also one Morgan Freeman's acting is an aspect to take in consideration, which it is close to perfection.	9
 Short and Simple	One of the best movies i have seen till date,I did not see it till 2015 and always wondered whats's so special about this movie that it's sitting there at the top of the IMDb list and hasn't'been dethroned since ages? I finally decided it was about time i find it out and holy moly,it totally deserves that spot up top and i don't think there will ever be a movie which comes to a s close as this.	10
 Not the best	Yes The Shawshank Redemption is a good movie. Very good. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are very good actors. It has a good scenario but come on. It is definitely not the best movie in the world. I think it is overrated. Fight Club or The God Father must be the best. But I'm not surprised at this because The Devil's Advocate's ratings is 7,5 so it's not in the top 250.	10
 Best Hollywood i have ever seen	Words can't explain about this movie. It's rating says all about it. Awesome and must watch movie. The story is about Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. There is No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.	10
 Honestly, Best movie ever.		10
 The best story-line ever pictured in a film	This is simply one of the best films I have ever seen, my all-time favorite. It is a poignant and very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The acting is truly magnificent by all the casts. There is not a single dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. It is an amazing film that people will be talking about in 500 years.	10
 Pure fire	this film was the tits Tim Robbins was the man and Morgan freeman was as good as can be if i had to give it a rating out of 10 it would get 10 i liked it when he digs his way out of the prison over a number of years if that was me i would of shanked my way out of the prison Morgan freeman as red excelled in his role the ending reduced me to a bubbling mess	
 Probably my most seen movie	The first time I saw this movie I was probably at the age of 12 and I have seen it many many times since the opening theme gives me the chills every time I hear it. I can't say anything more about this movie that hasn't been said already I can only recommend the Stephen King book on which it is based. The book contains 4 short stories 3 of which were made in astonishingly good movies. This one, Apt pupil and Stand by me.	10
 all time favorite	one of the best movies I've seen. it still stands in my all time top 10 movies. it has a great cast an amazing story line. I've seen this movie so many times. and with each viewing I'm impressed with every bit. it never fails to amaze me when i watch it.casting directors could not have made a better choice when casting the rolls to this movie.	10
 Shawshank	Unbelievable film with the ability to emotionally overwhelm you, great plot with a prefect ending, some scenes lacking energy but others make up for that. Great cast carefully selected, couldn't think of better characters to play the roles as brilliantly. Even after watching this film many times it still touches me each time. The way that Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins bounce of each other helps to really bring the film to life.	9
 Masterpiece	Probably one of the greatest movies ever made no wonder it's on the top of the 250 List. I was personally holding back from watching it but the moment I found out Morgan Freeman was in it I just couldn't resist. Indeed it's been quite some time since the movie got released but it's just one of those golden works of art that can be picture at any time or place	9
 Best movie ever		10
 One of my most favorite movies	One of the finest films made in recent years. I've watched it many times.. It's such a well made movie that transcends age or gender. You can have this movie running when the whole family is around, they will all be able to follow the plot and there are no parts of the movie that that the older kids can't watch either. It's very rare these days to get a movie of such high caliber, it is timeless and is just as good to watch today as it was when it was first made.	
 A masterpiece storytelling of friendship and wisdom in the time of despair	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about time, patience and loyalty. Not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. Morgan Freeman performance is outstanding. It is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.	10
 Reading between the lines	Awesome movie! With a between the lines concept. Two different races accomplishing one goal, to be FREE! In the midst of struggle we come together as a common people to achieve greatness! No barriers can contain the mind of man and his will to be free! Perfect location to show the endurance and genius of mankind. Alcatraz, the most ruthless prison known to man!	10
 Classical	"The story may sound simple, but the truth behind the words is remarkable. When I heard the name of the film first time, I considered the Shawshank to be a man' name, but in fact it is a jail's name——a hell in the world. Not only for the inhumanity of the prison——they behaved brutally; but also for the jail gnawed at people' heart by keeping them waiting and waiting as life passed. It seemed that only those utterly worthless people who gave up everything could survive. That's where the story happened. The part impressed me most is when Andy got out of the jail. He extended his arms in front of him in the heavy rain as if he were welcoming the fresh air and the freedom. At that moment, I saw the confidence win the darkness, discharging light dazzling the eyes in the dark blue sky. Under the light, I could feel my recreant heart being shivering as his voice said: ""Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies!"" That's why I like this film: it encourages people to fight to preserve the dignity of human beings, to appreciate the beauty of life, and the most importance is to keep hope forever. He once that is born, that is die. Everyone is the same. The only difference is whether busy living or busy dying. The film tells us that even a man can live once, but if he keeps confidence, keeps hope and works his life right, then once is enough. The freedom is the bird that feels the light when the dawn is still dark, the hope is the chief happiness that this world affords, and the life should be full of the singing of the bird and the happiness hope brings. ＂ What's that do you think? It's the trembling of the heart, the singing of the mind, the flying of the soul and the hope to be free."""	10
 Awesome	This is one incredible film. I like the way he goes into to jail all sweet and innocent, then a few months later he is running the show haha. its so clever how he tunneled out of the prison and used the poster to hide his work. if you want a great film to watch, i really highly recommend this one.	10
 Absolute Classic Movie	This movie is a timeless classic with exceptional performances all round by the entire cast. Could watch this movie over and over and never lose interest. The entirety of the film is filled with stunning music, visuals and plot with some really suspenseful, funny and lighthearted moments to be enjoyed from generation to generation	10
 Great Movie	This movie is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen! The story is beautifully written and the acting is on point. This movie definitely deserves to be on top of the Top Rated Movies list. If you haven't seen this movie yet I can only recommend you to watch it cause you will have a good time with this movie.	10
 Great Film	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes close to sounding one of those human victory. But most of it is conserved. It is assisted greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a up-lifter named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two."	8
 amazing	one of the best movies i have ever watched! 10/10 would watch again. the subtle details and beautiful cinematography! it was very well calculated and the ending was the right amount of vague. the best scene has to be when he is escaping from shawshank and he has to time his strikes with the rock on the pipe with the lightning so he wont make any noise. amazing movie!	10
 Masterpiece	This film is so amazing. This is about a man called Andy who is found the guilty of the murder of his wife and her lover and sentenced to a prison. He struggles to get through hardship. He is so smart that he becomes an outstanding person. First of all, this film is narrated by the second lead character, Red, which makes the audiences see Andy from Red's view unconsciously. His smartness leads to an incredible ending. Each scenes are dropped advance hints, and in the end, each pieces are put together. His smartness blew me away. This film makes us think about what the life is. The last scene is incredibly beautiful. This film is definitely one of masterpieces.	10
 Great !	I love this movie, certainly one of my favorites, both surprising and captivating. Films like these are becoming increasingly scarce. His director is once more overflowing with imagination and the end of the film is extraordinary. I advise those who have not yet seen it. But it would surprise me ^^	10
 great gritty film	one of the best films iv,e had the pleasure to have watched, from the very start it has you glued to your seat, I've lost count of how many times I've seen it as its just 1 of those films you can watch time after time with getting bored , somehow it makes you feel as if you are actually in the prison at the same time and seeing everything that's going on at the time,	10
 Gripping, Moving, and occasionally Mindbending!	The Shawshank Redemption is a film that is continuously moving forward; a stream of characters and narrative arcs are put into the foreground for around 20 minutes each, in each of these, a different aspect of prison life is conveyed, and occasionally, the tone is entirely different from the previous one; despite this, the film avoids feeling anthology-like with a consistent setting.Shawshank Prison feels living and breathing from the moment it first appears on the screen; via the forever-moving background characters, and the varied environments inside and outside of the prison! Shawshank itself is one of the most interesting things about this film, and quite possibly why it appeals to so many people; prison is an inherently interesting location to set a film; much like a school or workplace setting; there is a sense of order: people's routines are controlled by people above them - Shawshank combines the relatability of this with the crime and drama of a courtroom or heist film.Please have a nice day, and enjoy the film!	9
 Shocked me Andy	Get busy living, Or get busy dying. choose your life what you want.This is a awesome movies,i watch it again in 2017.The movie give me power and confidence. People should pursue freedom. Should not be institutionalized by high walls. Even if the body is bound by life, thinking and soul should continue to pursue.	10
 Master Full.....		8
 really awesome feeling	"A sullen Minister of Magic Rufus Scrimgeour (Bill Nighy) sets the mood for this seventh and penultimate of Harry Potter. ""These are dark times, there's no denying,"" he intones gravely, pointing out the grim state of affairs facing the nation- murders, disappearances and raids- but reassuring the public, as any politician would, that his Ministry has it all under control. Of course, he is only bluffing, and it doesn't take long before the palpable sense of doom and despair convinces you otherwise. Welcome back to the magical world of Harry Potter, one that began with wonder and joy, but has since become shrouded in death and darkness. Still visibly distraught from the death of his mentor Professor Albus Dumbledore, Harry is now tasked to continue with the mission of the late Dumbledore- to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes (accursed objects containing fragments of Voldemort's soul). It doesn't get any easier, since Voldemort is nearing the height of his powers, and his bidders have infiltrated the bureaucracy to paint Harry as a wanted criminal. There are fewer and fewer allies around- even those within the Order of the Phoenix may have since betrayed their ranks- and the first half hour quickly establishes the danger and urgency of the situation at hand. Members of the Order, including Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), attempt to escort Harry to safety- but even that mission is met with an attack from the Death Eaters, culminating in a exciting high-speed flying-bike chase that shouldn't disappoint fans looking for some action sorely missed in the last movie"	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation."	10
 best movies ever	I don't believe that Hollowed could produce like this movie again. It was on my wishlist for a long time but I did not watch until I subscribed with Netflix. It is such a powerful one. I do believe that it will remain on number one for more than ten years. Its is highly recommended for every one wants to see real American movie. This is the one. Just leave all 2017 movies and watch this one first.	10
" ""Brilliant"" in every meaning of the word"	Shawshank was a brilliant story that had every right to be retold on the silver screen. Its main theme is corruption, which I often find myself enjoying. Corruption is a slow process, but it's very impactful once you notice it's happening. I love subtle changes like that. The moment of realization for me was Tommy's death. Looking back on it now, there were plenty of tells that the warden was abusing his power, even before this scene. But like I said, power corrupts slowly. So slowly, you don't even notice it happening until something drastic happens, and this movie perfectly captured that concept! Props to Stephen King for creating such a well-thought-out story!	10
 Best of the best		10
 Top 10 greatest movie of all time ?	"The experience of a hot-shot banker named Andrew Dufresne played by Tim Robbins. After being sentenced to 2 life terms for the killing of his wife and her lover, Andy then finds himself to be an inmate at the Shawshank prison. For a crime, he swears he didn't commit. The movie is centered around Andy's journey as an inmate in the prison, the brutal beatings and harassments, and changes he experiences. Where Andy meets another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman, mistakenly picks him as the new prisoner that will most likely crack under the pressures of prison. After the beating and killing of one of the new inmates (fishes) Andy still does not break. Reds ability to obtain wanted objects helps establish a friendship between him and Red. This friendship leads to many prison adventures and later events help him and he gains respect from his friends, staff, and the warden.Motifs displayed in the film are Corruption and crime. The idea of the prison should be the rehabilitation of men. However, instead the prison is focuses and praises corruption, greed, and money laundering. Andy's quick willingness to launder money for the Warden Norton played by Bob Gunton showed his survival skills and need to protect himself. The editors use of voice-overs and flash backs sets the scenes for viewers allowing them to be able to see the events of the prison.My thematic ideas of the film are Isolation and imprisonment, which seems to be a large focus of the film. The bars, strict schedules, horrible guards are just some of the reason for isolation. The film shows a lot of people taking advantage of the system for their own gain, from Red, who smuggles anything into the prison. All the way to the Warden, who benefits from forced prison labor and money laundering. However, the power of hope is Andy's main driver throughout his experience in prison. Andy attempts to maintain his self-worth and idea of getting out one day. Tunneling his way through the concrete cell wall. Hope is all that Andy has left."	10
 The King of the Movies	One of the most beautiful movies ever seen in my life. First of all, among the dramatic ones, the first one regards all genres. Outstanding cast, fantastic acting, impeccable direction. A Morgan Freeman as I had never seen him, Tim Robbins best actor. To die without seeing this film, would mean not having lived right.	10
 Best movie ever without a doubt	The after effects of this movie will affect your mood for sometime for sure. Its the most heart touching movie I have ever seen in my life. At first it didn't seem like the best movie in the world as everyone talking about but I don't know when but at some point you will forget about everything and start to melt in to this movie. This is unbelievably deep, no movie has ever came to that depth. Its unimaginable levels of sadness you could feel for yourself. Its scary too in a way especially when you realize this happens in the real world for lots of people.	10
 Amazing Movie	Amazing movie! One of the best I have seen in a long time. I always come back to this movie when I need to be reminded of what it takes to write/direct/produce an incredible movie. Everything about it is cunning, brilliant and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Felt like an accurate depiction of what prison life is like and I would encourage anyone and everyone to see this movie.	10
 Wonder full movie should be in our watch list	The which was #1 in the still feel proud about that. It tell that an accountant which doe't commit an crime of murder. And he been sent jail for that and there the story begins he mean time go work with others prisoner's and help cops for hide payment of tax to the government and he planned to escape form prison when the day he came and he escapes.	10
 Inspiring	The best picture of all the times, based in a novel of Stephen King, this movie is about how a person goes to prison for a crime that did not commit and faces all the adversities that could happen to him, is inspiring. You empathize with the protagonist at all times. with good performances, and a good script.	10
 My Shawshank review	There's no more information to tell then what others already have said. For me this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. A great story, top of the line acting and a very good mix of actors. There's only 1 thing left to say if you have never seen it....you NEED to see this movie!	10
 Closest that Hollywood has come to perfection	The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made. Apart from a small number of nitpicks, this film is flawless. If you haven't seen this film, you need to. This film represents how good Hollywood can get and has set the bar very, very high. Not a single frame of film is wasted, every aspect of this film is important, it is just perfect.	10
 Awesome	The only reason this movie didn't get a 10 and got a 9 is because of the young man who was about to reveal the truth about Andy. lol This is the type of movie that you will cry a few times, laugh a few times, and most definitely think a few times...I love this movie...could watch it back to back on repeat...he great ending and so the good can prevail and have hope. Very well directed and every character was believable and when you see them in other movies you only go back to this movie. Maybe not a family movie but surely a couple get up under the cover with the popcorn movie. Excellent and will always be a classic.	9
 Escape and Lesson	"Despite many similar comments to me, ""the Shawshank redemption"" this is not just an iconic picture, this picture shows what you need to be with friends, how to strive and what sacrifices you can go. The film is about the pursuit of purpose. It documents the lives of prisoners without much to embellish and without detracting. The main character is a man who himself is fighting for his life and destiny. He has small knowledge in the field of financial transactions he helps organize the escape from prison. This picture gave me a boost in life by showing that using their skills where ever you are, you can achieve success and their dreams."	10
 Rewiew	"""Escape from Shawshank"" - a film by Frank Darabont, based on the story of Stephen King. The film was not the most successful at the box office, but managed to earn the recognition of both critics and spectators. The picture tells of Andy Dufreyne, the former vice- president of the bank, who got to Shoushenk prison, from which no one managed to escape. For the murder of his wife and her lover Dufrejn was sentenced to life imprisonment, since all the testimony of witnesses and evidence against him, but he does not admit his guilt. But did he commit this crime? Maybe he was in prison because of an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances? We will not get answers to these questions right away. Everyone must decide for themselves what to believe."	10
 Legendary movie	This movie is getting old,since the early days it become a classic, is a absolutely must saw movie. The end of the movie is amazing. Great story, great actors. Well deserved the first position on IMDb ranking. Some details we only can realise/understand after seen the movie several times.	10

While in jail he suffer many hardships such as assaults etc. However he also makes some wonderful life friends and his soul mate portrayed by the excellent Martin Freeman who eventually helps Andy escape from Azkaban.

 One Of Best Movie In World	"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.In 1954, Brooks is paroled, but cannot adjust to the outside world after fifty years in prison, and commits suicide by hanging himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in him receiving solitary confinement. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving bribes. He has Andy launder the money using the alias Randall Stephens.In 1965, Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary. He is befriended by Andy and Red, and Andy helps him pass his GED exam. In 1966, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but he refuses to listen and sends Andy back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy declines to continue the laundering, but relents after Norton threatens to burn the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican coastal town. Red feels Andy is being unrealistic, but promises Andy that if he is ever released, he will visit a specific hayfield near Buxton, Maine, and retrieve a package Andy buried there. He worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked another inmate to supply him with six feet (1.8 meters) of rope.The next day at roll call, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, using the rope to bring with him Norton's suit, shoes, and the ledger containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens and visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money, then mails the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. FBI agents arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid his arrest.After serving forty years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."	10
 best movie every seen	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shaw shank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."	9
 The Best Movie Experience	It took me 23 years to watch this movie. 23 whole years, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The simplicity, the story line, everything just amazing. I have read plenty of reviews and many people suggested that I see this move and I have actually owned it for a number of years but never took the time to watch it. I then read a book called 1001 movies you must see before you die and of course, this was one of the movies. I decided to make a list and start making movies off. I am so glad I did but this is a jewel that I would have never taken the time to watch.	10
 my best movie	i'm grateful for this movie , because the feeling after i finished it was a new feeling , its more then satisfying. the movie show you what happens if you never give up and how to enjoy living your live even in the worst Circumstances. the actors were perfect. there is nothing to say people didn't say it,shortly The Shawshank Redemption deserve to be in top ten best movies.	10
 This is legendary movie	I have seen this movie since childhood, it gives me so much emotion, I love all the people in the movie, and the movie changes think of people. It talk about We have the right to life, freedom and rights. Longing for happiness, thanks to the film, director, and actor, a truly excellent film.	10
 A Fantastic Story Of Redemption	In My Opinion The Shawshank Redemption Is The Greatest Movie Ever Made. Now You Might Disagree And Say That That Movies Like Citizen Kane, The Godfather Parts 1&2 Or Casablanca Are Better Movies But While They Are Great Movies I Wasn't As Emotionally Invested In The Story Or The Characters Nearly As Much As I Was With Andy Dufresne's Struggle Of Freedom.Now The Story Of The Shawshank Redemption Follows Andy Dufresne ( Tim Robins ) A Former Bank Merchant Convicted Of The Murder Of His Wife And Her Secret Lover And Is Imprisoned In Shawshank Prison. While There He Meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) Over Time Andy Learns To Live With His Past Haunting Him. Full Of Corruption Andy Attempts To Uncover The Truth Of What Is Happening In Shawshank Prison While At The Same Time Planning His Escape From It. The Shawshank Redemption Is Full Of Stunning Performances Including Tim Robins Quiet Portrayal As Andy Dufresne And Morgan Freeman's Oscar Nominated Performance As Red. Now O Love Watching Classic Movies But No Scenes Strike Me As Emotionally As Red Moving In To The Same Apartment As Where Brooke Hung Himself And Saying To Himself I Just Have To Face It I'm Not Going To Make It On The Outside And Andy Dufresne Realising That In Life There's Only Two Choices You Can Either Get Busy Living Or Get Busy Dying. Now This Just My Opinion But I Think That The Shawshank Redemption Should Have Won Best Picture At The 1995 Oscars Because While I Enjoy Forrest Gump I Do Find It Is A Bit Cliché And A Bit Overrated. If You Have Not Seen The Shawshank Redemption Yet I Highly Suggest You Get Find It And Watch I Promise You Will Enjoy It. I Give The Shawshank Redemption A 10 / 10	9
 good		10
 Simply marvelous entertainment	I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camarderie and redemption. must have been in the source material.Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.	9
 Number one	This movie is great. A complete masterpiece, the players are carefully selected and deserves the first place. Especially when the film-in heads have a normal turn, especially the last half hour. Everyone has to watch before they die. I can not think of anyone else in this role in Tom Hanks.Morgan Freeman In seems to be a little passive, but the director could not use it effectively. There is little action in the film, but this lack is closed with its own mystery and fluency.	10
 In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding.		10
 Intense	One of the best movies I have had the chance to watch a movie and enjoy it. The cast, the acting and above all the story line was phenomenal. The producer and the directors must get a heads up for writing such a great story, so realistic and dramatic that I watched it twice.This is a much watch movie for every adult and I guarantee the suspense and end of the movie will shock you	10
 Very good	This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.	10
 Shaw shank Redemption	I really feel like this was a great movie it showed how jealous could over take anyone and cause them to murder their wife and their wife's lover and i'm not saying it's right but in a jealous rage of anger i feel that anyone with extremely high emotional problems would lead to killing someone's spouse and their lovers.	10
 Practically Perfect	Honestly, it's hard to think of a movie better than this. It has everything on an emotional level. Fear, love, hate, temptation, sadness, happiness, and of course...redemption. I seriously mean everything. The ending when two friends finally reunite in the belief that they live happily ever after, is mesmerizing. The shot of Andy and Red hugging it out on the beach, as the camera zooms out sends chills down your spine. If you haven't seen this movie, I do not know what you are waiting for. The characters are all great, the acting is superb. The people they want you to root for are easy to root for, and the ones they want you to root against, are easy to root against. Superb job from the actors, directors, cinematographers, etc. One of the best movies ever made, maybe the best I have ever seen.	10
 great movie	Must see. Great movie with an unexpected ending. I have seen it so many times. One of the best prison-based movies in history. Great performance by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. I recommend this film to everyone and it does age better than most films. I haven't met anyone yet that doesn't appreciate this one.	9
 The Big House	"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie which is hypnotising in just how good it is. You know the type of film; whenever it's on TV (which in this case it constantly is) you have to stop what you're doing and watch it - one of those rare movies in which you don't want to end. With the all the movies out there in which you find yourself checking how long is left of the running time, here is one in which you see there is a whole hour left and you're glad; the mark of a truly great movie.Carcerophobia is the fear of going to prison and is something which has crossed my mind in the past, partially brought on by movies like The Shawshank Redemption. Even if you've committed nothing illegal like Andy Dufresne, there is always that possibility that an honest law-abiding citizen could end up in the slammer. The world of Shawshank State Penitentiary is one with little to no human rights, one with shocking but believable treatment from both the guards and fellow prisoners as they engage in brutal, sadistic acts. Regardless of what prisons around the world are like circa 2017, your ""whole life (is) blown away in the blink of an eye, nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"". The Shawshank Redemption may be one of Stephen King's non-horror works, but the prospect of going to prison for a crime you never committed gets under my skin.One of the aspects of The Shawshank Redemption which intrigues me the most in the empire Andy builds while inside prison as well as an insight of the economics and commerce which goes on between the prisoners and guards. Just like Robert Stroud in Birdman of Alcatraz, he is still able to find meaning in his life despite being in what first looks like a hopeless situation; he is able to find hope in despair. This really does show that at the end of the day, knowledge is power. Likewise, Andy sending a letter every week to the state government for prison library funding and ultimately playing with the system, always something which inspires me.What makes Andy Dufresne such a great character? Like Tim Robbins himself, there is more than meets the eye. Robins has an intelligence to him and you can't quite figure out what is going on behind his eyes, an actor with a mysterious aura to him and this comes through with the character of Andy. He is not like the rest of the prisoners, he's a civilised gentleman thrown into the jungle that is prison but he's not a sheltered fool ether and knows how to deal with his new surroundings. But why do I need to tell you this, the narration sums up his character perfectly in a beautiful and poetic manner - ""I must admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over."" Likewise, I also find myself very intrigued by the character of Brooks; just how does such a gentle soul end up in prison? Did he really commit a crime? Who knows?Morgan Freeman has the ability to play wise old men without coming off as a stereotype or a cliché. His narration is describing what obviously appears in the film, so what makes it so great? Like the best film narration, it's to do with its poetic manner and the way in which it's delivered; scenes in the film were shot to time with the pre-recorded voice over plus it goes without saying Freeman has one of the most heavenly voices ever. None of his dialogue is necessary for the advancement of the plot, yet what would the film be without it? There are just so many inspirational quotes.The escape sequence itself so incredible yet at the same time is entirely believable and one of the most satisfying movie revenge plots. Many people always point out as to how Andy could reattach the poster to the wall when he begins his escape through the tunnel, even Frank Darabont acknowledges this on the DVD audio commentary although I am puzzled as to why this is made into a big deal. Andy could simply attach the poster to the wall at the top two corners and allow gravity to cover the remainder of the hole and simply crawl into it from below as if the poster where a curtain, likewise we never see on screen if the poster has been reattached on all four corners.When I think of films which can convey an expansive range of powerful human emotions and feelings and act as a form of emotional therapy a few instantly come to my mind - It's a Wonderful Life, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and The Shawshank Redemption. Films which help one to break from the mental prisons of our life."	10
 Great Movie	To me as a Filmmaker, this movie is extraordinary, as a Director when watching this movie it's gets me on my nerves to compel a great story lines with an amazing educational background that gives me or every other directors out there nothing but an incredible directing job. Though we still have some directors out there does poor directing jobs even when their Screenplays story lines are great and on point, but this film the Director was in charged of his game,did great. Casting was an amazing one, thumbs up for the for casting director, the actors are cool, took charged of their games. Morgan Freeman, I Love you.and to all other actors in this very movie, great job done I Love you all and much respect.	10
 One of the greatest film films I have ever seen	A Serious cinematic urgency.. And the glamorous performance of Morgan Freeman . Although the idea has been dominated by many films. But the scenario here is amazing ... And through the crew in this movie . Everything was perfect. From start to the end. An enjoyable cinema meal.	9
 Literary ,Movie Review	"The Shawshank Redemption A literary/movie reviewIt is often said that a book should not be judged by its movie; based/adapted on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption the movie The Shawshank Redemption tries to oppose this claim. Frank Darabont, the director of the movie penned the screenplay to perfection (near about!) , having acquired the filming rights from his pen-pal Stephen King. Albeit He made some changes in the screenplay from the novella , these changes make the movie more watchable! Lets say Frank took some cinematic liberty which even bettered the movie from the novella. The strong voice of Morgan Freeman narrates the movie sequences for us. The character of Freeman is an Irish (Ellis Boyd Rankine ;called as Red in the movie whole time) in novella and Frank alludes to this fact when Freeman tells Andy Dufresne, ""maybe because I'm an Irish."" The story is obviously inspired from Leo Tolstoy 's story ""God sees the truth, but waits."" (Andy is wrongly? accused of murdering)The film also refers to Alexandre Dumas's ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" . Actually this scene is quite comic and funny. Heywood , a fellow convict of Dufresne's reads wrongly the name of Alexandre Dumas name as dumb-ass, then Andy corrects him and tells him that the book will interest Heywood that the book ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" is also about Prison break and Red (Freeman) says jokingly that the this book should also be put under Educational pile of books. Both the book and movie tells us about a smart banker (Dufresne) who is wrongly convicted through fate for the murder of his wife and her lover in cold blood. In the mid-way of novella and the movie We are told that there might be a possibility of acquitting , but while novella disperses this possibility gently , the film does something quite different and shocking, Another cinematic liberty!! Then the through the Banker or Red , we are acquainted with the hardships and cruel practices ongoing in the Shawshank Prison. How Andy Dufresne copes with the Prison environment and find new ways of amusement as in listening to opera, setting up of huge library and teaching fellow prison members. Of course his journey is not a smooth one. A major difference in physique of Andy is depicted in the movie from the novella,where Tim Robbins is Tall and strapping , Andy in the book is average height and of weak physique which makes him prone to attack of sodomites and how he fights them back. Both book and movie make us realize the price of freedom, hope and endless patience and perseverance. Andy picks up a curious habit which he used to pursue when he was free in his home which helps him a lot as we move through. Then movie shows the usual and Cruel! Prison officers and wardens, their scheming and corruption. How Andy fights them and overwhelms them is a study and pleasure to watch or read whichever you choose. P.S.-Rita Hayworth is Chekhov's Gun in both movie and novella!!!! Quotable Quotes- ""Get busy living or Get Busy Dying"""	10
 Best movie ever	This movie is top one i ever seen.It probably wasn't as clear to many, back in 1994, how great the movie is. During my own first viewing of the film (which must have been back in 2008), I enjoyed it a lot, and moved on. But it began to loom so tall in my memory then when I revisited it, I was stunned by how much better it is on repeated viewings.	10
 I don't know how this failed in the box office back in the days!!	No spoilers ahead.Certainly one of the best movies ever made.I first watched this movie three weeks ago. I liked this movie so much that I watched it around three more times despite my busy schedule.Here are some things to watch out for in the movie.1- Plot: The plot is fabulous. It is filled with surprises every now and then. The plot would certainly hold you on your seat.2- Dialogues: The dialogues are too good. This movie is one of the very few movies with inspiring dialogues. Some of the dialogues will be remembered forever.3- Direction: The direction of the movie conveys emotions very well. While watching this movie you would certainly become a part of Shawshank prison.	10
 A must watch Movie!	A must watch movie! one of the best movies of the 90's. I watched this movie not knowing what it was. Surely enough i was hooked right from the start. It is a cinematic masterpieces. If you have never seen this movie, watch it now. ___________________________________________________	10
 Just a no.1 Fav for everyone i think..	If your a fan of The Count of Monte Cristo and that style, your gonna love this, its what gave Morgan his narrative start and, well, Tim Robbins is fab, Great film, a must watching, revenge, friendship, loyalty and more, although not that successful at the Box office, because of the title and Pulp fiction, it is still today one of most people s top 5 films, watch it and find out why... i actually watched it again the other day, just to see the Rock hammer... and did you know most UK pub landlords put it as there no.1 film, strange, maybe thy all want to escape...	10
 All Time Great	This adaption of a Stephen King short really shows the hardships of prison life and the struggle of those there to keep their humanness as the pressures around them try and strip it away. Watch whenever its on no matter where in the movie it is. The movie is engaging no matter from what point you catch it. Morgan plays his character well showing the hardness from growing up in such a unforgiving place and the caring of a soft heart.	10
 Good but not that good	Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this movie a lot, but the hype around it and it being considered the best movie ever is a stretch. It is top 50 or something but definitely not the best. That being said it is still an amazing movie. Great plot, great acting, great writing and all around a great movie.	8
 Classic.	Real good movie! A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations. I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camarderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.	9
 good	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - - not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	6
 Best Movie all time		9
 Generally	Real good movie! A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations. I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camarderie and redemption--must have been in the source material.	9

 overall great movie	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."	10
 mind boggling, magnificent	i watched this movie in 2008 and i still have not forgotten about it. this means this movie was so good it has been embedded in my brain. I am amazed at how the movie was shot. story line and cinematography was the highlight for me. what better way to tell a story about prison break... simply Amazing.	10
 Its just for top.	I can't remember how many times watching. You planning, life is planning too. Only have your mistakes. And life goes on. You must goes on. Rules is not change, only you change. Sun different, water's taste different, bread different. But life goes on. You must goes on. Just isn't for own. For own family.	9
 Hat's off Mr. Darabont	"I only regret one thing, I didn't see this movie on a large screen in '95. Everything is perfect, Freeman and Robbins are perfect in their roles, and even Bob Gunton in the role of master and Clancy Brown as captain Harley who both hate (the captain still looks sympathetic when he beats Bogs but the master is more than detestable). We find in this film the injustice in its pure state with Andy Dufresne twice sentenced to life imprisonment for two murders he says he didn't commit, and that he didn't commit and who is making friends with a resident who has been there for 20 years, Red, known for being ""the man who gets everything"". The ultimate injustice falls when Tommy, a ""little asshole"" who took two years for burglary, learns to Andy that a man killed his wife and her lover of, an opportunity for Andy to prove that he is not guilty. When the director asks Tommy if it is true and young man says ""yes"", he killed Tommy to protect his interests. However, Dufresne happens to escape from prison and takes all the money he had laundered for the master and he go live in Mexico after he denounced Norton, forcing him to commit suicide. This film shows us a great friendship between Freeman and Robbins but it also raises the problem of reintegration, showing us Brooks, detained for 50 years in Shawshank, not surviving the outside world and committing suicide. This film is perfect, music could be the weak point but I would just say that's not a strong point, which does not prevent the fact that this film is a masterpiece worth a 10/10! Hat's off Mr. Darabont!"	10

Beautifully captured the director definitely has a taste to what hes been doing. Gods gift and way to go it is definitely one of them movies everyone need to watch .	
 Blown away	A simple film about friendships, hardships, dreams and hope. This film was recommended but I only watched it recently.

Watch the movie and you'll realize why it will remain on the best even	10

 Masterpiece	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a great film to watch; some might find it stressful, because in fact it is a serious drama that shows a lot of injustice, violence, and other discouraging scenes. But, all this is needed to show how a single man with a dream and strong character can withstand all his misfortunes and change any life circumstances for the better."	10
 Exciting story	Exciting story, cool story, my family loves it all. We watched it several times. Really this is a highlight, the excitement in the movie passes us. Differential that marked the film, and brought a unique characteristic. Its direction, its actors, its actresses, really marks generations, and will pass through generation to generation.	
 An excellent movie	This is a phenomenal movie that shows just how much you can achieve by striving towards your goal and being patient, despite the difficulties life throws at you. The acting is incredible and the picture is sensational. Well done to the director, producers and also the actors who made such an amazing film. It surely deserves its number one spot on the greatest movies of all time.	10
 Hope is a good thing.	"Shawshank Redemption will always be my favorite movie. This is not a depressing movie, it's about hope and the reality of life. I will be forever grateful for this movie. ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	10
 A masterpiece with it's 'amazing simplicity' of story-telling.	At the time of writing of this, there're already 4594 reviews. So I'll surely not go into the details.It's been not more that 3 years that I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first of numerous times. And it was certainly one of the best that I've or will ever watch. The narration, portrayal of characters and the plot line, everything in this movie is top notch. It's a masterpiece. Moreover, it's highly inspirational. You can easily watch this movie over and over without getting bored. And it will inspire you every single time. So if you're one of those unfortunate souls who haven't watched this movie, take out a couple of hours from your routine asap and get on with it. Then only you'll get the how good it really is or why do people like it so much!	10
 Simply the Best	This review is written to contribute my fair share to making sure this stays the number 1 film of all time, because it is really thoroughly deserved.The beauty of the simplicity. The depth of the characters. The strength of the bonds. The legendary performances. The captivating score.This movie excels on so so many levels. If you read this review and haven't seen this movie yet, go watch it. Turn off the lights, have a glass of wine with you and listen to the story of Andy Dufresne. It will stay with you for the rest of your life.	10
 Worth to watch	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have seen. The movie encompasses friendship and hope in though circumstances. The movie is simple and hasn't a lot of technical merits but that isn't needed. The message of the producer is beautiful and the movie is an all time favorite.	9
 The best of all	This movie is the best I have watched ever. The top one in history. So Meaningful. Teaching movie. Brain boosting movie. The acting of both actors are great and the director is so good. I have indeed watched this movie many times because it gives me good feeling and other thing is its made few decades ago and still people like me love to watch it. Over all its a great movie.	10
 Really well executed film	I don't know what it is about this film but you feel a real connection with Robbin's character, the whole film flows together really nicely plus Morgan Freeman's performance is excellent. The payoff at the end of the film is also really good and I think really makes the film as a whole. A definite must watch if you've got a fair bit of time to set aside - it's a long film - not a very tense film but a quality watch none the less.	8
 This is my favorite movie of all time		10
 Awesome Story!	I love this movie, I could watch it over and over again if I wanted too. Great plot, awesome actors, and love the soundtracks. This is one of the best movies out, even though this movie is over 20 years old. This is something that you want to watch with your friends or family. We have to give this movie a 10 out of 10, there's no other movie can top this. The actors and directors busted their behinds with this and we have to give a round of applause dude!	10
 IMDb #1	Contains Spoiler. Well it has been number one for years for only one reason. It's simple, predictable, yet so amazing and gripping. Story revolves around imprisoned guy and his life in jail to the end, what ever it might be. Step by step his downfall, making friends with another inmate. Unlike any other prison story or stories about prison break it is something more and becomes complicated with successive watching.	
 Awesome Movie	This movie is really great. Teaches some of the important life lessons. This movie shows what prison does to a person and how someone can cope with it. How a person serving sentence becomes when he is released. The bullshits you have to go through in the prison. I am thrilled with the overall experience. No wonder this movie has stayed at the top of the IMDb ranking list for a long time. Enjoy it while you can.	9

 The best film I have ever seen	This an incredible film this movie was make feel the happiness this unbelievable 20 years dug in the jail without nobody know. The Shawshank Redemption should be played throughout the world in all schools to teach people the hard life of prison but the bond between friends and the idea of hope. Morgan freeman is a second to none actor he lays the role perfectly and i could not think what the film would be like without him. All the other actors perform perfectly. this movie is a movie of inspiration and one of which will get people through harsh times. this film always restores my faith in mankind I simply love it.	10

 Hope is a Good Thing. Maybe the Best of Things. And No Good Thing Ever Dies	This is one of my favorite films. I watched it several times and was ready watch constantly. Each frame is beautiful, the story is amazing. The film goes for a long time, this time flies by unnoticed. If somebody not yet seen, then I advise you to look, and it is better not to time. The actors play is amazing! Thanks for this movie.	
 Amazing Film	I don't give a 10 often, but I must say that the power of the story and the marvelous execution by the cast makes this one of the greatest films i have ever seen. Re visiting it many years later the film not only holds up, but may have even improved with age. I would recommend it to any film lover.	10
 Movies better than Books *	"There are good books and good movies and does not depend of the source material In the eternal struggle between which is better if the book or the movie?, this is a point for films. The interpretation of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins manages to be more endearing than the novel, based on the short story "" Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" of Stephen King, all that adds the film improvement history in every sense and pulls out completely unnecessary sexual details that are common in King's stories(Apt Pupil, It and more) This is a movie that portrays freedom as any ever and definitively one of the best films of all time Is't a pity that came out the same year as Braveheart and some of the Oscars"	10
 Review	This movie is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. This movie keeps you engaged and guessing the whole time, which is what makes a movie good.

 The triumph of human spirit in the Shawshank prison	The Shawshank Redemption is the first film of Frank Darabont and the best movie of all times, undoubtedly.Based in the short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank redemption' of Stephen King (the master of terror), this adaptation is the most realistic story about the hard reality in the prisons and an excellent reflect of our daily life (fear, hope, routine, justice, ambition, freedom and so on).There are many interesting and endearing characters in the story; however, I only can mention the main characters, they are: - Andy Dufresne: the main character, a man condemned to two life imprisonments for an error, however he is the most optimistic and intelligent character. - Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding: the narrator, the best friend of Andy and the person who get anything for the prisoners. - Samuel Norton: the ambitious warden of Shawshank prison and the main antagonist. - Brooks Hatlen: the old man that takes care of the library in the prison and the institutionalize man that must confront his hard reality.In the story, we can watch the main ideas of the stoic and existentialist philosophy, especially the last ideology such we can see in the Andy's actions because he looks for his liberty and he makes his destiny. For more information, anybody we can see the next video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91XDnA9z8h0.Like in Mulholland Drive, another of my favorite movies, Rita Hayworth has a great importance along of story because Andy have a poster of Rita Hayworth, he and 'Red' watch her film 'Gilda', and Stephen King uses her name, maybe as a symbol of yearning of hope.This film we can divide in nine parts: - The Andy's judgment: Andy is condemned to two life imprisonments. - The first two years: Andy must confront many problems in the prison, especially Bogs. - The ascent of Andy: Andy helps to prisoners, guardians and the warden. - The destiny of Brooks Hatlen: After 50 years in prison, Brooks leaves prison but he must face the new world. - The prison's library: Andy builds a better library in the Shawshank prison. - The Tommy's story: Andy decides to help Tommy, a new prisoner, and he will help to Andy. - The descent of Andy: Andy have problems with the warden so all needs hope. - Andy gets his freedom: Andy gets his liberty and 'Red' tell us how he did it. - 'Red' gets his freedom: 'Red' gets his liberty but he must fulfill a promise. However, the story is very fluid, so anybody could enjoy the story in all moment.The most powerful scene in the film is when finally Andy gets his freedom and he celebrates in the rain, because it represents the triumph of hope after many years, furthermore the soundtrack is excellent in that moment.Along of film, there are important sentences that invite to reflecting: - Get busy living, or get busy dying. - Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. - Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free (This sentence not appears in the film, but it is important for explain the story).This film is the best and more people must know this masterpiece of the cinema story.	10

 its a movie bout a prisoner who escape by digging hole in the wall by a hammer.	Amazing movie. The actors are great and dialogues are incredible. Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is arrested for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment at the Shawshank prison. He becomes the most unconventional prisoner. This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Call this the Stand by Me of prison stories.	10

 one of the best	A few days ago, with great pleasure, I reviewed the film. And this One of those films about which one can say beyond time. Excellent A game of actors, an excellent story and elusive from the first viewing nuances, Who leave the desire to revise this film. Film that worth seeing necessarily.	10
 Amazing	Best movie It is definitely worthy of its number one spot for so many years. I am never bored of re watching it The credit goes to director on shaping the movie in such an interesting way and the ending of the movie is arguably among one of the very bests. One might feel the movie is a bit slow at times, but you are always into the plot which brings on new surprises consistently.	10
 Great movie	Andy Dufresne s sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red and his life changes forever.One of the great movies ever made. It really has everything a movie should have and I wonder why Forrest Gump won the Oscar that year...	10
 Shawshank Redemption top 10 best all time movies	"This happens to be one of my top 10 all time best ever movies. Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this movie. As is Tim Robbins. I've watched it at least once a year since it came out. Please, sit back and enjoy an awesome film. I still resit one of my favorite lines in the movie.""Get busy living or get busy dying."""	10
 Best Movie Ever	This movie is without a doubt, my favorite. I was young when if was released so only saw it a few years back and it's remarkable. One day I would be fortunate to re-watch with my kids. The metaphor to this movie can be seen when the Protagonist had to pass a pile of bad stuff to get what he desired. Incredible performance by all.	10
 There's always a hope!	One of the most wonderful movies I have ever watched. This movie is all about hope and patience and the fruitful path that they lead to. It clearly portraits the life prisoners face while in prison and the gloomy life they lead when released after serving a long term when there's nobody to turn to.Marvelous performance by Morgan Freeman as well as Tim Robbins. It was a real treat to watch this movie.	10
 Softly into your heart	Filming location (mostly): prison Characters(mostly): men So... Romance? Definitely No Happiness? Struggling to find it Humor? Rare Then it's must be... Aggressive? No Depressed? No Haunting? No It's actually a beautiful movie that show us what patient, courage and a pure heart can do	10
 10/10		10

 Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover.	I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies.

 review	Redemption has many meanings depending on the point of view. But Joining friendship, determination, sense of justice, hope, patience, Goals and purposes, all packed in a dream, and freedom, is not Any redemption. It is the fulfillment in life. Learn the value and gift that Freedom represents when it is achieved by mixing these Ingredients all. The film is simply a must-see!	10
 Amazing	One of the most amazing movies out there. Everyone can relate or feel some type of sympathy towards the different characters in the movie. The plot is just so well written and the directing is incredible. The acting of every single character in the movie is so believable that there are times throughout the movie where you feel like you are there, physically with them.	9
 I remember the first time I every saw Shawshank..; It was one of the greatest movies I'd ever watched		10
 excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This one my favorite!!!!!!!!!! Just love this story. Ready to review a million times. And still will be the best. The film makes you experience everything on yourself. You will love it! I do not even know how I put it on, I'm in a situation like this.	10
 it was OK	"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today."	8
 Jail	Wonderful, amazing, glorious, are three words to describe this masterpiece. The acting was good, and the plot better. This film shows us the strength of the human spirit, true friendship and especially what we all crave, desire and trustWonderful, amazing, glorious, are three words to describe this masterpiece. The acting was good, and the plot better. This film shows us the strength of the human spirit, true friendship and especially what we all crave, desire and trust	10
 Best movie watched so far.	"The acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is excellent. The Direction and script was equally amazing. this is probably the best movie I've watched so far. The plot of the movie is engaging and suspenseful and keeps you guessing to the end what the different characters outcomes will be.A story of despair and of hope. More even, than all of that, ""Shawshank"" is a story of humanity, and one that will stay with whomever watches it for a very, very, long time. You will never see another like it. And the mere perfection of this movie, by a novice director.its simply one of the best films off all time 10/10."	10
 It was alright	Yeah so I gave it a 7, and it was better then average but wasn't amazing. I think it was meant to have some ulterior meaning or some deep philosophical meaning that those who watch it are meant to sit and think about. But meh. It was okay, some guy kills his wife, goes to jail and escapes. I didn't hate it but was it the most gripping story ever - no. The acting was good I guess but frankly it wasn't that exciting and I forced myself to finish it because it's meant to be a classic. At least the ending wasn't as bad a Citizen Kane.	7
 All time Great film.	I've read the short story by Stephen King, I've seen the stage play and, of course, I've seen the film, I would say this, read the short story, don't bother with the play but, whatever you do, see this film. It really is a timeless classic. Obviously the characters and time line are a bit out which is why it helps to read the short story but that doesn't detract from the film whatsoever, so well made and acted.	9
 The Redemption	"It's a really heartwarming story, but also a perfect review of the age. Great actors bound there..What else can i say? I think its in the top 10 movies. So a ""must-see"". Exetra extra.. Why are you reading this? Just go and watch it. I'm not kidding. Now."	9
 The story about men	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne ""Tim Robbins"", the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding Morgan Freeman. It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy ""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over"", and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."	9
 The Shawshanj Redemption movie review	When I first finished this movie I don't think it's an extraordinary movie, but when I saw it second time on TV, I was like Wow, how could people don't like this movie. The blocking,the shot, the actors, they're amazing.Especially Morgan Freeman, the narration is the best.The character Andy was awesome too.	10
 Loved the movie	It is one of the best movie I have ever watched. This movie is based on the real story I guess. It shows a talented person. His passion and love for freedom. His friends salute him very much. Really the must watch movie. Will you be the same, if I saw you in heaven. No words more than this. I guess the movie may help the depressed guys to once again live up their life.	9
 It's a movie that you will watch. and again, and again....	"It's amazing that such an ""old"" movie without the theatrical super effect that we see nowadays in any action movie, is still holding strong in its reviews and critics. There is only one reason for this: SUPERB ACTING!!! While Tim Robbins appears to be the main characters and leading man, the show is being stolen again and again by Morgan Freeman. But they do complement each other so much that I could not envision this movie without both of them in their respective roles. The rest of the cast, come and go throughout the movies and bring additional drama, emotions and a greater sense of what life could be in prison, either if you are the prisoner or guard. Of course there are parts of the movie that are a bit ""far-fetched"", but you know you are watching a movie, not a real-life drama so it's easily forgiven as it brings deeper enrichment to the movie.SPOILER ALERT: My best scene is when Red (Morgan Freeman) is getting the envelope that Andy (Tim Robbins) left him by the Oak Tree. He scans around to ensure that he is not being watched and he opens the envelope very carefully, while continuing to look around to ensure no one is watching him. What an amazing actor to be able to portrait that sense of distrust of everything, after spending so much time in prison where it becomes a fact of life to always ""look over your shoulder"". I'm always in awe of his acting whenever I come upon this scene. I have seen this movie way back in 1994...and probably at least 10 more times since then...and whenever I flick channels on the TV ( in the odd time I watch ""real"" TV) and see Shawshank Redemption playing...I just can't stop myself to watch it again!"	10
 All around good movie	Great Acting, Great Storyline, Great Graphics, Great Sound, One of the Best Movies of All Time, The Shawshank Redemption is a must-see movie for anyone who likes and enjoys movies. Through all the twists of the story and all the moments you won't expect there is an ending that is one of the most gratifying in cinema history and will fulfill any viewer.	10
 One of the best movies	One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances.Just perfect.	10
 Wow.	I really don't even want to write this review because words can't describe the beauty that is The Shawshank Redemption. There are simply so many underlying philosophical themes embedded in this movie that do a masterful job of analyzing society, the concept of hope, the will of the human spirit, and the bond that can be created by two human beings. I didn't want this to be my favorite movie simply because it has the highest rating on this website. But, after taking the time to sit down and watch the whole thing I am 100% content with the fact that this has become my favorite movie, as of now... (5/13/17)	9
 A must see for any avid movie-goer.	Growing up with The Shawshank Redemption, I would always find myself being reminded of the lessons about life and morality that are taught through this movie. Being able to distinguish good from bad is an important skill and The Shawshank Redemption does an exemplary job at providing how people in difficult situations can still be able to overcome the oppression they are faced with. Each character in the film is an endearing component to the life of the movie which hammers its story home to the viewer.	10
 Opinion of an amateur.	I think that in this film everything is executed to the highest degree genius. Every frame of the film, this is a masterpiece. There would be an opportunity to put this film 20 balls. I would not have thought of putting it. The actors play is brilliant. Everything is perfectly beautiful. And the tortures of prison life are conveyed as thinly as possible.	10
 Deserves a #1 spot on IMDb's top 250	While this isn't my favorite movie of all time (although it would most likely be in my top ten), I can clearly tell why this movie is placed in the #1 spot on IMDb's Best Movies of All Time. It tells a truly powerful story, and is an inspirational one at that. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give stellar performances, and you truly care about what happens to each character. It's a tale on belief, hope, and the determination of what someone has to become successful. I've seen this movie about five times within the past year or so, and it still hasn't gotten old for me. This is definitely one of those movies that you have to see at one point in your life.	10
 I love this	Honestly I love this movie so fun and so nice to watch like yeah I found it so Good and so interesting bandit was just so amazing. To watch I can't even tell you how awesome it is .............................. So good I love all the charters especially the black guys there so good actors and so fun to watch I love this movie almost as much as I love South Park I think everyone should watch it like no joke so good I just can't even tell you how awesome It is like Omg	10
 One of the greats!!!	Excellent. I have watched this film several times. Great direction. The acting is superior. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best in my opinion. I have never met anyone who doesn't like this film. The best thing about the film is getting to know the characters. The pace of the film is perfect. Every scene gives meaning to a great finish. This is basically a prison film that takes the time to let you get to know all the characters, where they come from, and in most cases where they are headed. No spoilers from me. If you have not seen this film then it will be much better knowing as little as possible about it. There is so much I can say about this film but I will end right here. Enjoy if you have not seen.	10
 Awesome Movies	A very powerful and moving piece of work. This film revealed hurt, pain and love all in one. Very emotional and yet touching all in one. My wife cries on every viewing.This should be a classic to watch over and over.Great Movie	8

 Fantastic movie!!!	This movie is going to end up on the all time list of it hasn't already. Morgan Freeman was fantastic. As was All the other actors. I could watch this movie over and over. I'm not sure that anyone who rated this movie poorly is even human. It's a great story of struggle and overcoming obstacles.	10
 Really great movie	This movie is really great. I give my highest recommendations to all that wants to watch a great movie. In the movie we see some of the best actors and they really show what they are made of. The movie is based on the book (with the same title). I have not read the book yet - but i intend to do this soon. it was obvious to me that this movie won 7 Oscars after watching it. Best. Casper Ravn-Sorensen	7
 The Shawshank Redemption	I watched this movie just after I watched The godfather. I had heard a lot about godfather but I didn't like it at all. But The Shawahank Redemption was great. I really loved it. And the funny thing is that I had never heard about The Shawshank Redemption. But when I searched the top 100 greatest movie of all time I found this movie at the second place right after The godfather. Then I decided to watch it and I really enjoyed every minute of the movie.	
 Best movie ever	One of the best movies I have ever seen. Great story and the actors have done their part very creatively. The filming was brilliant. You will be thrilled the whole movie. Absolutely recommended for the thriller and drama movies lovers. The story is about hope and friendship, very simple movie with no special effects.	9
 interesting	Tender, funny, and inspirational, The Shawshank Redemption is a well- crafted prison drama and another great movie to add to Frank Darabont's impressive filmography. Morgan Freeman is the standout as one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, while Tim Robbins and a host of excellent character actors fill out an outstanding ensemble cast that makes you feel like you are there with them in that prison. This is an emotionally satisfying film with many memorable character moments sprinkled into an otherwise pretty standard plot. While I find it to be a little too sensitive at times, this is an excellent motion picture and a must see.	8
 its Turkey film but its good	it is actually good i watched when i was a little boy but i can remember whatever this film is so impressed me and i loved it so much sorry my English by he way English is my second language. i know this film but you know never say never right? actually i am crazy and i have no idea what i am talking about	7
 The best movie.	This is my first review and what other to start with than the shawshank redemption. The first time I watched it i was amazed at how much I could love a movie. The acting is just so superb, the story is what kept my eyes glaring at the screen for nearly 2 and a half hours. It truly is a masterpiece of a film and people will still be talking about it for decades.	10
 Probably the best film ever made	This film has to be watched by everyone . It's just superb. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant actor. The story is good and the acting is the best I've ever seen. It's a long film but trust me you will not regret watching this film. It's a shame they never made a follow-up of this movie. This movie will still be on TV many many years from now.	10
 Nice Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.	9
 The best classic	Great movie! Not the newest movie anymore but the best classic I know. Movie with a great story, excellent shots and never gets boring. Watched it so many times now and could watch it anytime again. Definitely worth watching and you won't be disappointed. Won't tell to much about the story because that will ruin it. Just sit back, relax, watch and enjoy a great classic!	9
 Good one	Morgan Freeman at his best as the OG on the yard back in the day. I liked when they all got brews on the roof. Definitely one of the best movies I have seen. Feel sorry for old man red and how he got institutionalized. By submitting this review you are agreeing to the terms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

 excellent movie	The story is amazing and everybody should watch it. It's one of the best movies and i really enjoyed watching it. The actors are perfect for this movie. I remember the first time when i watched it and was so amazed from it that i put it on my self made list so i could show it to friends which movies i really liked but then i found out about the ranking list here on IMDb and did it like that. great movie..watch it. :)	10
 Classic	Story of a man that over comes some challenges that would probably kill the normal man, or at the very least break him. Wife murdered, convicted of crime he did not commit, wrongfully imprisoned. From crooked guards to corrupt warden he out smarts them all even his friend. This man never gives up. Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance's and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.	9
 amazing	SSR is one of my all time favorite movies. it is boast with a great cast, and a great story line. i loved this movie from the first time I've seen it, and still to this day enjoy watching it. i think the casting agency did a great job when selecting the cast for this movie, with an amazing director to boot.	9
 I can watch this every time I see it on the guide	Love this movie. The gotcha at the end is great. Shows how jacked up the system was back then. Frankly to similar to some systems today. Watching the characters struggle with adapting to life in prison, and then life outside...heartbreaking. Leaves you smiling though. I would not want to swim in literal crap, but ya do what ya gotta do, right?	
 Great	The most awesome movie. Which I have ever seen. The fair first Place in the ranking. In general, King's films have a completely mystical filling. Not like everyone else. In his childhood he re-read all of King. In the wild Delighted. This is a real topic. I advise everyone to watch!	10
 best movie ever	This movie was the reason i fall in love with Morgan freeman voice, This is a movie that stands the test of time and still resonates with viewers. Here we have all the things that made this movie so great and such a satisfying experience: lovable characters, writerly flourishes, one-dimensional evil antagonists, enduring friendships, poetic justice, and a happy ending, i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did peace.	10
 Once in jail, always in jail.	The Shawshank Redemption is the quintessence of film regarding life in prison and the different aspects of the human condition. The film survives without needing hard violence, language, or sexual themes. Performances by the cast are what make this movie feel authentic and bring the characters to life.	
 The First Film In Top Rated Movies	The film, which has the ability to impress all viewers with different tastes because of the text of the arbitrator amazing story clinging to the mind of the viewer to the end. The film has been nominated for seven Oscar Awards, including best film, best actor Morgan Freeman, best filming and best adapted script - based on the story of Stephen King - the same director Frank Darbont, who later made a great film. Stephen King - titled The Green Mile 1999.	
 Çok iyi	Sadly I had to travel to an old and tiny cinema to see this movie as it didn't play in the major cinemas on the Gold Coast...after watching this movie i have absolutely no clue why.I truly enjoyed every minute of this film, all of the actors did a great job, especially Morgan Freeman. I did see some of the plot lines coming and still got a bit of a surprise in how they delivered those plot lines...if you get a chance and like a classic with brains then go and watch this!!!	8
 This movie.	"This movie is good. One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 This is gonna leave a mark	Watched this movie a year n half ago still the scenes from this movie flashes in my mind every now n the whenever any person talks about the last movie they've watched n claims that to be their best movie n then I recommend this very movie. Epic Legendary n one of its kind I bet no other actors other than Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman would have done justice to the roles	9
 Brilliant flick!	Probably the best movie ever made. Good-feeling all the way! Tim Robbins is doing an amazing job. I don't believe this movie ever will be outdated. Morgan Freeman brilliant as usual. Best 2h22m of movie- time in my life! This is just a solid movie with great characters and a surprising end. I don't ever think there will be made a movie this good.	10

 hope is alive	Beautiful movie that hope alive in the audience. A person who escaped from prison after 20 years. Well the main characters. Good complementary character. Morgan Freeman was unsurpassed.Be sure to watch the sky.Certainly not sorry to see him.Rank 1 deserve this movie. best movie IMDb. Thanks for read my review.	10
 Amazing	'I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.﻿' Best Movie I Ever Watched. Which Teach You The Meaning Of Patience and Hope , every time I feel depressed and sad, I watch this film and I feel better	
 A MUST-WATCH movie	"""Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying"" This is one of the few movies, I'd give a 10/10.1994 was an amazing year for movies. Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction and this.While Stephen King adaptations and novels are known for their supernatural horror elements, this movie incorporates a different, real horror of the Shawshank Prison.Accompanied by amazing performances from Tim Robbins and the evergreen Morgan Freeman and meticulous direction from Frank Darabont, this is one of the few movies, one has to see in their lifetime.I think the IMDb ranking of this movie is enough for you to give this movie a chance."	10
 Simply Brilliant!	This has got to be one of the best movies of all time. The simplicity of the direction, the casting, the performance and the suspense in the end just adds to the beauty of the story line and script. As the summary says - Simply Brilliant! Needless to say, Morgan Freeman is what makes your heart love again in this one.	10
 A Recurring Experience	I keep coming back to this movie as one of my favorites of all time. I especially find the casting executed to a high standard, and even though the basic story line is fairly straightforward, the multitude of layers and twists and turns reminds of the best works done in the Hollywood studio era back in the 40's.	9
 not bad	"A very beautiful movie '' revenge is a dish eaten cold '' with the tyrants, not with the tyrants, but with the wisdom will win the battle. As always, the Morgan freeman has again wondered. Human beings go there if they are forced to say what they are going to do and go there and act and behave like that and they say it is right. ""There is no right or wrong. There are some pooch ideas. You can act differently from the community. In this case, you are in power and you are always one step ahead of the others when the struggle starts. Justice may not always be fair. It's a very good movie, but I can not say that you deserve # 1."	8

 The best movie I ever seen	"The movie is full of hope and it got me a lot of positive energy. The cast and music are great. I liked the screenplay and it has a really surprising ending. I regret that this movie had to compete with other powerful movies like ""Forrest Gump"" in the Academy Awards and lost many nominations to it."	10
 Very Meaningfull Movie	What a great movie! you get emotionally attached to the characters, you feel as if you are going through the events as they are. The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt a well polished and constructed. You wonder about what was done in the process of creating the movie, which could have made it so moving and so heart-touching.	10
 Excellent Movie	From start to end, a masterpiece. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were both gold in their performances here. An All-star cast headed by these two, to make movie magic gold. One of Frank Darabond's best films.Its the type of movie you can watch over and over again. On a philosophical point, some great life lessons being told in the story too. A definite must own. A classic for sure.	10
 Master piece..	brilliant screen play...very important movie for all The way Director narrates the story line was brilliant.. Performances of each actors was superb.. at the end..director stand top.. kudos to each technician in the movie..apart from other sections ...backgraound score was brilliant..to beat this movie record was takes more time in the history	10
 Copy From Someone	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time. Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system. There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see. The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own. Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	10
 This is an excellent movie	Stellar performance by the cast and beautiful cinematography. one of the great films. Synopsis Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins is sent to prison to serve two consecutive life terms for the murders of his wife and her lover. Movie succeeds in emotionally communicating the brutality of prison life. Creatively written characters and captivating script. A must see film.	10

 A gift to humanity	I don't have words to describe this precious gift given to humanity. This is more than just a movie having some divine touch. Sixth time I saw this in a dream. Every other movie seems vapid. The best a human can create. Every time I watch this movie, I get something new. This is the reason I made my IMDb account. Love you Shawshank Redemption 😘	10

 Shawshank Redemption Review	"Shawshank Redemption is One of the finest films about hope and the power of friendship. It tells a lesson about life. The cast gives a great performance. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines throughout the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end was brilliant and smart. What makes this film one of the best films made is the message it conveys."	9
 Best Movie at all	I think u will never find a Movie Like Shawshank its amazing Legendary Good Scenario Good Actor Good Every Thing You loosed your Live if you Didn't Watch it. Once When i started To watch This Movie i expect i will see bad Movie but i saw one of The Best or The Best Ever I watched you will enjoy To Watch . The Actor Doing Will and its Paste of True Story that meaning Is challenge To introduce the Good Movie But the Did . The Best Ever	10
 Love to watch again	This is the story of a man named Andy DuFresne, an intelligent man convicted for murdering his infidel wife, despite claiming innocence. DuFresne experiences the harsh conditions inside the prison and suffers, but works from within in search of some form of redemption. I'd recommend 15+. There's a lot of brutal, unlawful violence against prisoners, often in detail, while the overall message of how a prison spell can destroy a man mentally and physically is very depressing. There's a very sad suicide halfway through.	10
 magic	get ready for ride of your life.....sometimes bad things happen to good people...but what really defines someone is how he/she reacts to such bad situation. Andy is caught up in one such situation ...the movie is about his response to such clumsy situation....and believe me he strikes back harder and beats it...director takes us through hardcore prison life enough to make us realize whats it like to be free	10
 1994's 'The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Awesome movie	It's such a beautiful movie about life & it's hardships. It focuses it's main theme on the fact that hope can make you strong even in the worst situations too. And, friendship was shown very nice in this movie. I just loved this movie, this movie goes so smoothly from the beginning to the end. I recommend this movie to all those who feel that they are facing hardships in life, maybe this is just a movie, but, the content in this movie is much more valuable, and there is a lot to take from this film into our lives.	10
 A Heartwarming Tale Full Of Transformation: Roller-coaster of Emotion		10
 Goog movie!	Is the Best movie! It's that people have not seen a film close. I think flawless. In the end, I agree with the film. It literally brought closer to life. Although the prison guards do not quite agree with, but I accepted. Overall, this film is good because it is about life, do not want to talk about. And it is difficult to bring film.	10
 Awesome movie	"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, and although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."	10
 Yes yes yes	This is the film that made me realize how far a short story can go. The first time I saw this film I was quite young, didn't fully understand the content but I knew I was watching a master piece and knew that I needed to focus on my writing. Whittmore knocks his performance out of the park. I miss him and Frank is now one of my hero's.	10
 Spectacular	This is definitely one of my favorite movies. The story-line was captivating, and unpredictable. I watch it every time any network airs it.The best part about the film is that the actors are very believable. You feel as if you know each and every character personally. There is not a dull moment, and they get right to the plot. There is never a time where you are twirling your thumbs waiting for something interesting to happen. Two thumbs up!	10
 Good	Excellent movie and will never be repeated. I hope that is represented by a strong film and you do not think that is a strong representation of movies like this film. I've watched this movie more than four times because did not hate him for. Thank you, because I wish you lots of luck. good bye	10
 good movie	Its not my number one but it definitely is a great movie. good pacing and good character development, the whole movie keeps you engaged and even the slow moments are made better by the narrative. each time I see the movie the moments that really make you feel deeply always hit the same heart strings just like the first time. There is no real issue I have with the film except that the TV edit does it no justice.	10
 Iconic film		
 Great Movie	This film still holds the test of time. Even now the acting and pace are both excellent even though movie making has evolved since then. If you haven't seen this film you are missing out on watching an instant classic and a movie that would easily be one of the greatest in history.	
 A requirement	If you haven't watched this movie yet you're probably from another planet. Then again Aliens might like movies. I digress, this movie is fabulous! A classic in its own right. Legendary scenes and lines that will hook you in. There are a lot of lessons about Integrity and the consequences of life choices. I think everyone takes something away from every movie, this is no exception. Its just an exceptional movie I think everyone should watch.	10
 most beautiful drama movie	i like this movie very much because its inspiring characters.this movie will show you the environment of a prison and life of the prison.how they feel releasing after a long time from prison.i like the character of anddy and his way of working.i like morgan freeman's character and his friendship with anddy.we can say that it is a inspirational movie.i like to watch it again and again...	10

 Moving and Memorable	One of the most inspirational and powerful films I have ever watched. While The Shawshank Redemption didn't make it big in the box office, it definitely made a lasting impact in the hearts of many people, including myself. Hope, friendship and love are all themes that tie into the plot of this movie, and it will leave you on the edge of your seat up until the very end. This film will touch your mind, heart and soul, and the actors do a wonderful job of not only becoming an embodiment of their characters but also create and maintain memorable impressions. This film challenges people's perceptions of others as well as themselves and serves to demonstrate that life teaches people to make good use of time while time teaches people the value of life. A timeless and touching film that should be treasured for a lifetime.	10
 Life Changing	This is an amazing movie that everyone should see at least once in their life! This beautiful movie with Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is just spectacular. Watching Andy change the prison and the lives of the prisoners inside makes your heart twinge. The humor and heart in this movie is really what makes it great!	10
 This is not best	Robbins, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenance and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.	8

 Best Movie Ever	This movie is a masterpiece !! The worst hardship is possible to happened in every single moment ,but this movie teach the viewers that hopes and dreams are unlimited and could tumble the hardest situation . The lesson of the movie is that Patience , willing , and selflessness could make dreams come true in the end	9
 The most significant film of my life ...	He was one of the most beautiful and most impressive films I've ever seen. Especially for Morgan Freeman's play I was impressed. Apart from that, I have to admit that life brings a different point of view. It is one of the only productions that teaches me not to lose hope, especially. It is a rare production that teaches me again what it means to hope in every view. I strongly recommend everyone watching many times.	10
 Very Intriguing Movie	Love all of the actors. The was Morgan Freeman narrates this title shows his greatness as a voice over actor.The visual work in this movie is also spectacular. Being set in a prison it feels gloomy and dark. However, when it transforms into the lush green country outback you really get a sense of how visually a film effects you as an audience. Tis is a brilliant movie that must be respected.	10
 Brilliance!	"One of my absolute all-time favorites, a must!""I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.""""I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.""^^^ Both awesome quotes!"	10
" I love jobs"" so I know it's you."		10
 This's wow		10
 Shawshank Redemption	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy Yaşamak' or get busy Dine'."""	10
 Such a heart warming and life changing movie.	"I just watched The Shawshank Redemption and I probably should let my mind sleep on it before I write anything. However, I can't wait, this movie is so powerful I don't know how I lived all those years that I've wandering throughout this reality and I've never watched this masterpiece before. So, let's go back to the purpose of this review... Write about the movie, Shawshank is a movie about hope, about how someone can fight all the adversities that life can throw at them and get up with a smile on their face, how you can stay strong when everything seems so dark, how you can learn with the worst of the experiences. I gotta be honest, I'm pretty bad at writing in English(My first language is Portuguese) but I had to say something. I wasn't sure about watching The Shawshank Redemption but I'm so glad that I didn't listen to my unreasonable prejudices about old movies. I had seen a lot of wonderful old movies, and still, my mind has those setbacks with them. So, to bring an end to my review I just have one more thing to say ""I urge you to watch The Shawshank Redemption, you won't regret that choice."" ^⁻^/"	9
 White Supremacists hate this		10
 Super Movie	The most fantastic movie I've ever seen. Absolutely the best. There are no special effects at all. The entire movie it's a real story. I think this movie will be on the top for a very long time. I will definitely watch it again and again Because you have to many things to learn From this movie. It represents the sad reality of that time And even more, reality of the present time. Impressive is the part near the end of the movie when he escaped from the prison and with a new identity he starts a new life and when the director shots himself. I will keep supporting this movie and I hope there will be more movies like this coming because it is fantastic.	10
 One word: remarkable	The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I've ever watched without any discussion. I went to check it out to find out why is it on the top of IMDb's list and has the highest ratings. A masterpiece, heartbreaking and filled with divinity. Provides hope and leads person to fight in life.Many times we feel like as if we were deceived and punished, and we did not deserve any of that. And I am not talking about crime and prisons, I am talking about everyday, the small things and injustice that makes us feel bad. What can we do in that kind of situations? We can run away, scream, or even have revenge... But we can do what Andy did in this movie, we can fight and show everyone we are better than them.This is the primary message I got out of this film, all those others about friendship and loyalty are secondary. Also, for me in this film, it is extremely important that God has done justice and reward those who have really been on his side, and punished those fake believers.	10
 Deserving of its place as the best film ever made		10

I watched over the years and it has been a lot since this movie, but still this one remains the best of the best.	10
 Best prison movie ever	Shawshank must be on everyone's top 10 movies of all time list. Thismovie is about perseverance, the fight for justice and just how far a person will go for freedom. Andy's intelligence and overwhelming sense of pride makes him a prisoner like no other. Morgan Freeman is exceptional as always. The entire cast comes together to make this film unprecedented even the unknowns were great. I appreciated the cinematography. I have a strange obsession with prison movies and this one fulfills my weird fetish. Shawshank is a true classic and if you haven't seen it, drop everything, carve 3 hours out of your life and watch it now!	10
 wonderful	First of all I must say it is a great movie. The characters are beautifully processed. Morgan Freeman is a very good player. It is clear that he has done great work with his years of experience. The movie was not very much watched at first, but it was later discovered. This film act was first directed to Tom Hanks, but he did not agree and preferred Frust Gump film. It's not a loss for himself, but the two films are fine. Must be absolutely monitored and preferred. The value is a film that must be known and must be kept in archive. I've watched it multiple times and watch it over and over. I would recommend it to everyone. It should be absolutely Observed and recommended to others.	8
 power full	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 Greatest Film of all time!!!	"This is a Hollywood Masterpiece. Undoubtedly the greatest film of all time. Flawless and perfectly acted. If you haven't seen this one ""Watch it immediately""The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money-laundering operation.Although the film was a box office disappointment, it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It is now considered to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition).In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, finding it ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"""	10
 Superb	"Basically, the movie is fantastic. The story is very good and the ending is really meaningful. So are the dialogues and the acting. The story flows slowly. That might be a setback. I really liked the way the prisoners led their lives. The scene on the roof, where they all enjoy was the best. Its totally worth our time. I will advice everybody to watch it. We can learn a lot from it. ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" This dialogue really struck me. The death of a certain character was really sad. I also loved the trick used on the warden. At some point, I think the police officer should have been punished more severely for his brutal actions."	10
 Lives to its name	The Shawshank Redemption is a classically quiet film about the injustice served to one man and his consequent adaptive actions. Frank Darabont has shown true talent in the creation of this near-perfect modest film with most scenes showcasing deliberate quaint beauty. Emphasising the beauty of life through many mediums, some ethical, some not, this film really helps the viewer appreciate life and the little things. With a cast performing their roles perfectly, this uplifting and high-spirited film is a stand alone about every simple aspect of life and how it is approached. The Shawshank Redemption is a deserved classic.	9
 Global view	the main strong point of this film is a good backbone that created by multi layer, complex and unpredictable screenplay, and the dream of success inside all of us, especially in the bad times that everybody think, things goes not well, it is the story of life, and prove for us that every single second is valuable and must be seen carefully, with a plan toward future. it learn how politics works, and the chess playing of the life. and being ready for different scenarios of life. the playing of actor are good, and also overall atmosphere of film. camera, and flying shots for 1994, were really good, and state of the art. music and sound effects were really compatible with the moments of film, the other strong points of this film was the curve of info that screen play gave to viewer, it was trigger curve! as till end you can't predict any thing, you can create your own ending, happy or sad, (normally sad), but suddenly every things will change. this is really good, when you do a empathy with main character and then you will see that he finally winning the game.	9
 Best Slow Movie	Best slow movie.You want to end but can't just to know what will happen in last. Once you started to see your interest would be created.Actually this movie is for specific person who don't get bored if there is no action or romance or hi-fi stuff. This movie contains a lot of time in talking to each other.In this movie direction is good and story-line is best but it took time to develop base.Once your interest is created you'll never pause the movie. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	This movie has that certain indefinable screen magic, every line of dialogue spoken has real conviction and meaning, and the performances in this movie are nothing short of magnificent. Tim Robbins delivers his best screen performance ever, as the quietly spoken Andy. Here is a character like no other, so vivid, so real, that you can't help but like him. Morgan Freeman also delivers his best work ever as Red, Andy's friend. Freeman, while playing a different character from Robbins, is also able to give off a quiet dignity for his character. The supporting cast is perfect. From Bob Gunton, chillingly evil, but never over the top as to become cartoonish, as the Warden. Clancy Brown, as the prison Guard Hadley is brilliant, as is Veteran James Whitmore, as Brooks, who while given relatively small screen time is brilliant as the lifer con who's sad journey the film details.	10
 Classic Masterpiece	"""Hope"" is something which is an integral part of human nature. It cannot be subdued or imprisoned.This movie is really awesome. If you ever feel depressed about life or if you think that you don't have much to do in life, then u must watch this movie as it is motivational and would put you in high spirits. It shows that how even simple and small things can give you so much happiness.It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.The acting has been done in such a subtle way, that u won't be able to tell the difference whether its a movie or real life. How a person deals with hardships without indulging in violent acts has been amazingly portrayed by this classic masterpiece."	
 Good but not quite great (in my opinion) spoiler alert!	The story is utter nonsense while the acting is pretty good. I have watched this film many times and enjoyed it but fail to understand how it is the top rated film here on IMDb. The Warden plays his part to perfection and would never have allowed Andy to outwit his decades long tenure which in itself is simply ridiculous. The entire Parole board must have been bribed to keep RED ANDY & others inside so were in on the game as were those who organized work outside the prison walls. This review is critical and may not put smiles on easy to please faces but tough. there are many other much better films with fault free story lines.	8
 best movie	That movie you can see it ever and ever again to the rest of your life because you love every moment of him He deserve critically and commercial success every movie cannot reach that success for Thousand and Thousands we will be thankfully for the great writer in his best work he ever made and we will s till waiting for his next big thing every moment in this movie is important we would love to see that director again and again and he could be doing new with actors and writer once more that will be great and they will be blowing our mind this movie have one of the best movie ending and starting in the history of movies	10
 good film	"There are many movies that are able to induce goose-bumps or make the heart starts beating Faster FROM OR TO chest filled with deep breath. There will also be some production, which will take away from your eyes tears Or trigger a sincere smile on your face. If it really IS that It IS WORTH your comments. But ONLY masterpiece poised ALL These things. Takım masterpiece is undoubtedly the movie ""The Shawshank Stuck ""That Many times I have seen I certainly did not not refuse a pleasure to see go again. I could certainly Ten a long time to analyze the image, but I'm afraid I do doszedłbym a ceiling in stream estimate their depth the game extras. I confine to what has already described before adding: ""The Shawshank Stuck ""is a well-told story with depth hidden in the story and heroes, full of symbolism and amazing imagination. Work to provide (at least me) Many Inspiration for the soul and heart. It reminds me too, that no matter how bad it is, do not give up hope. Darabont's film lasts 2 hours and 20 minutes, but with you remain longer make ends meet."	10
 Exciting film	When we look at the issue, it tells us the length of time that a banker who entered the prison unfairly in prison. In some movies, you get the opportunity to smoke a cigarette or get something when you're in the movie. But you will want to watch this movie uninterruptedly. The film is the most film that reflects the best life of prison life. I am looking for something to criticize, but it is the number one film in my colloquium. Even if I have something to criticize, I do not criticize the number one film in my collection.I think it's one of the best films ever. A film that is cult and watched many times.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		8
 Great	very very great sir i really like an consider that i write a review for you . i am sport founder and here i found some best post that i want to share .http://celebs-networth.com/cristiano-ronaldo-net-worth/One of the biggest sources of income for the top class athletes of the world these days seems to be their business investments. Typically the sports superstars earn huge amounts of money via their salary, bonuses, and brand endorsement deals. But now they are turning towards other sources of income as well in order to maximize their wealth. And making business investments seems to be one such source. For instance, if we talk about Cristiano Ronaldo investments, we find that the best player in the world recently made headlines for his investments in the hotel business.	
 Inspiring	Story of resilience and the will of the human survival instinct. It tells us that even through our biggest struggles and thoughts of hitting rock bottom we should always fight for our rights and even though we give most of the things we have for granted, life is not as pleasing and can stab you in the back without motive. In its simplicity this motion picture captures the essence of what its like to be in this dire situation. Recreation of life in prison at the time feels quite adequate. Performances by Tim Robbins but specially Morgan Freeman's transcend time. This picture without a doubt will be engraved as one of the most popular movies of all time	9
 A prison film with a difference	A truly magnificent film for any film fan. Its harsh reality of the criminal justice system in twentieth century America captivates your curiosity. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman two criminals convicted to remain in the confines of Shawshank for life. Both men emanate opposing ends of society, in that Tim is beaten savagely by prisoners learning that life in prison was bitter. Morgan Freeman recognises Tim's need to survive, striking up a friendship that eventually, with time, benefits other prisoners are left to rot. It's more than one man, but its the depiction of struggle and determination emanating from the film adaptation of Stephen King's story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'that anyone could be face in our lives.A must see film that will change 160 minutes of your life.	10
 In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding		10
 There are places in the world that are not made out of stone	"Before I review this fascinating tale of abuse, intrigue and resourcefulness taking place in a penitentiary, let me state the following... ""Bad things happen to good people."" The movie starts with a court trial for the murder of a banker's wife. Our defendant is Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) accused of this crime and all the evidence or lack of points in his direction. Found guilty Andy and other recruits (little fishes ) are bused over to Shawshank Prison. During the ride, a portly (FAT ASS)Frank Medrano starts to whine about the fact that he's not suppose to be here.The rookie cons are greeted by the Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) who chillingly affirms at the end of his speech, ""Welcome to Shawshank."" Fat Ass continues to moan about being in jail but Captain Hadley (Clansy Brown) wanted to hear no part of his whining.Meanwhile the prison inmates where placing bets on which rookie con will crack under the strain of a first night in prison. As the neophytes walked down the main corridor to a loud bunch of inmate hecklers as they yelled endlessly,""Here fishy fishy."" Veteran Con Ellis Redding AKA Red our narrator played by Morgan Freeman bet two packs of smokes on Andy Dufresne. Meanwhile the majority bet on Fat Ass to crack under the taunting and teasing of the hardened inmates. The mocking was too much for poor, hysterical Fat Ass as he screamed for his Mommy as Captain Hadley beat him endlessly with his night stick as he laid lifeless on the cement floor. Prison life was presented in all it's harsh realities right from the start. The next morning Red was amazed that Andy made it through the first night without making a sound. As the movie progressed Andy needs a rock hammer to make Chess pieces. Red being the prison hustler/scrounger can get mostly anything from the outside, magazines, liquor and posters. Red and Andy develop a friendship/bond. One day the Warden offered volunteer work for the inmates to tar the roof of the guard house. The names where picked at random and Andy and Red were among the chosen for the task. The first day as the men were dipping there mops into tar buckets under the hot sun, Andy overhears Captain Hadley complaining of an cash inheritance. The other guard congratulates him on his new found cash but Hadley says the government will tax him on every penny of it. Andy takes a u-turn toward Hadley and Says, ""Do you trust your Wife?"" Hadley enraged, grabs Andy and is ready to throw him off the roof. Andy in breathless desperation replies, There's a way to gift your spouse tax free and I'll can show you how to file the papers and it's perfectly legal for a small price of three beers for each man working on the roof. A few days later it came to pass as his fellow inmate looked on at Andy as they were swigging suds on a hot roof. The Cons at least for a little while felt like men thanks to Andy and his legal advise. Andy had won the respect of his peers. Despite doing curry-favor for the guards, with W2 forms and retirement advise Andy wasn't protected either. Being constantly harassed and beaten by Boggs and his pose (The Sisters). Boggs wanted Andy for sexual favors and I'd like to tell you Andy put up a good fight but the truth is Andy ended up in the hospital infirmary while Boggs laid in the hole of solitary confinement for a month. Word got out about Andy's nemesis to Hadley and the guards and they didn't want their personal Banker harmed any more. Boggs was beaten to a pulp and the Sisters never laid a hand on Andy again.The movie continues and shows the hopelessness of an innocent educated man adjusting to an institution. Making friends and gaining respect with his knowledge in a world of maladjusted criminals. Building a library and fudging the books under the direction of the Warden. This shows how a person entering the criminal system become institutionalized on a positive side and a negative side. Veteran actor James Whitmore give an impressive performance as Brooks the original weathered Librarian. Also notable was the performance by Tommy (Gil Bellows) who takes this story in a different direction. The appeal of this movie is how everything ties together in a hopeless situation and comes out clean on the other side. The original book (Stephen King), was at best, ho-humm by critics standards but the magic of the screenplay brought this story to new heights. Kudos to the screen writing of Frank Darabont. Never get tired of this movie."	9
 Best movie ever	History simply fantastic, cast top, despite being a movie with many years, is still a movie that when seen, grabs the viewer to the screen, the entanglement and wondering how this fantastic story ends. From a somewhat confusing start, to a survival story, to a feeling of great friendship and compliment, this story has everything to be a success as it happens. As well as the small details that during the movie are happening and in the end, it has a huge weight and who leave the viewer with a feeling of, how is it possible? To anyone who has never seen the movie, I have only one thing to say, see this movie! Can not go wrong.And then leave your review here.	
 Never be institutionalized	This is the best movie that I have ever seen! Shawshank spent unbelievable twenty years digging his way to the freedom which is pretty impressive. He took advantage of his special skills to gain the trust of warden and captain. I almost burst to cry when I saw he and his friends drinking most delicious beer on the roof with wind breezing softly. He could never be bent, even though his enemies kept attacking him. I really wished he could be free with the help of that boy. However, the warden would exploit him to death and wouldn't ever let Shawshank go free. If the truth was that Shawshank was innocent, then the warden would rewrite the truth to keep Shawshank around him and working. After all his efforts, I was very happy to see Shawshank had another beautiful and decent life!	10
 Not original and overrated		5
 Greatest		
 wonderful	Its a really special film that everyone should see it! The topic is attracted me, its about the prisoners and their lifes. The prison life is very dramatic, it reflects a real life. The man who is Morgan Freeman is a really good actor. The last scene is very amazing.. It is the best film I have ever seen.. At first, I didn't intend to see this movie at all because I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. But one of my friend who is director suggests me. Therefore I decide to watch it. Well ı did not regret watching. I have watched it many many times and ı always offer this film to my friends. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship.	7
 Don't be fooled by the box office success	"I wanted to rate this a 10 but seriously I rated Good-fellas a 9. So I am not even sure why people rated this so high. I mean 9 is about right but at 9.3 that would mean a bunch of people gave it a 10. Seriously we are talking about the godfather and plenty of other great movies. Gladiator and so on. And its a 5 star movies (as I would like to say basing it off the hotel rankings). but 10, OK.Normally I click the spoiler alert on her just because right over it says black list and frankly when I hear the phrase ""blacklisted"" i think of Al Capone, so no thanks on that part. Which leads us right into the character Andy. He was accused of killing his wife and her lover. Plus the scene was set in the late 40's. Perfect time to set a script. I love the classic cars. You don't get people saying ""that would never happen"" most people weren't even alive then. Along as they aren't talking on their cell phone in the movie, then most of the time people just watch. Andy gets falsely accused mostly to his cold demeanor in the court room. Its 2017 and I watch Snapped, forensic files and I was a avid court TV watcher before they changed, and if you go to court in the fashion he did with a judge deciding your fate (i didn't see the jury read the verdict on that one maybe i missed that part) you are definitely not going to get any sympathy from the court. Which in his case and now you need all the sympathy you can get. He does all the taxes and even money laundering for the warden when he eventually plots and escapes prison only to get that money out of an account and then go on to live life on a beach. Why let another person steal your credit for hard work when you can get credit for your own work. I wouldn't suggest breaking out of prison to do it (that would be a felony) but high stakes high rewards, right?Also with Andy's character. He made you feel different and you wanted to watch him. He was not predictable. When turned up that music in the wardens office I was like ""wow that took some guts to do."" And also about the guys who kept torturing him and raping him, that made you feel different about things. This was a person who was struggling. And you wanted to see how it ended. What makes this film great is its dark and it brings you into the movie. Books have a lot more time and lot of ways to get you into the book with words than movies can do with video. Words lead to imagination and simply can give you a very vivid image. Video is what you see and what you get. Hard to duplicate a book so the best you can do is be dark about about describe people the best you can do in a 2 hour time block. Sounds easy but its not. When you watch this movie you feel like you are in prison. They don't waste time talking about the food in prison. We got it, I am sure the food isn't exactly like a restaurant in the Hampton. They spent most of their time explaining Andy.This is another story about a person who didn't fit in with what society has labeled him and he told people the truth and they didn't believe him. So he figured another way to bring the people who held him captive while fixing his own life. It didn't happen over night. He didn't just take what life gave him, he took what life gave him and used it against them and kept a memory of it and wrote everything down. My favorite part is when Tim ribbons is talking to Morgan freeman saying "" i had to come prison to learn to be a criminal."". I got chills from hearing that. Cause that is the truth. A smart banker mixed with criminals is very dangerous. They know all the laws, the loop holes and they have the patience and confidence to do it. I wouldn't rank this movie higher than the godfather like a lot of people have it on here. But its ranked as a 5 star movie to movie. Which puts it in the category of the godfather, casino, Good-fellas, Brave-heart, and the Gladiator. Then again this film is unique, the prison guards beat the lights out of people after the light are out."	9
 Great movie	"Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne Bob Gunton as Warden Norton William Sadler as Heywood James Whitmore as Librarian Written and directed by Frank Darabont Based on a novel by Stephen King Crime, DramaRated R142 minutes| Roger Ebert September 23, 1994 | Print Page""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	10
 the beautiful story about Andy who is sentenced to life in prison for murder, where he meets his future friend Ellis better known as Red	"I can say without even thinking about it that this movie, is the greatest movie i've ever seen, and i have seen a few. Everything in this movie from the way it is shot to the story makes this a must see for every so called ""Movie Fan"".The story about Andy Dufresne that is sent to prison for lifetime for a crime he maybe didn't even commit. And this movie shows how he handles his time in prison, and how he helped his inmates with getting better facilities by giving time and effort to get the funds needed. And don't even get me started on the ending, the ending takes the movie to a whole other level by showing us how he has been planning his escape from the start and the emotional pay of when Andy and Ellis meets in the final scene.All in all this is the best movie i've ever seen and probably the best i will ever see"	10
 Amazing Movie	One of the best movies I have ever seen. It is right up there with Good Will Hunting and Casablanca. Morgan Freeman is at his best in this and his acting does not cease to disappoint. This movie is an absolute roller-coaster. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that you lose yourself in. You become so immersed in what is happening that it leaves an indelible mark on you. To call this movie less than a masterpiece is an understatement. The script and the cinematography is beautiful. This is a movie I watch with my family at least once a month because it's a new adventure every single time. It is Hollywood masterpiece that should not be touched. Simply stunning, majestic and a brilliant piece of art.	10

I see your face in the mirror	10
 Great story, wondrously told and acted	"At the heart of this extraordinary movie is a brilliant and indelible performance by Morgan Freeman as Red, the man who knows how to get things, the ""only"" guilty man at Shawshank prison. He was nominated by the Academy for Best Actor in 1995 but didn't win. (Tom Hanks won for Forrest Gump.) What Freeman does so beautifully is to slightly underplay the part so that the eternal boredom and cynicism of the lifer comes through, and yet we can see how very much alive with the warmth of life the man is despite his confinement. Someday Morgan Freeman is going to win an Academy Award and it will be in belated recognition for this performance, which I think was a little too subtle for some Academy members to fully appreciate at the time.But Freeman is not alone. Tim Robbins plays the hero of the story, banker Andy Dufresne, who has been falsely convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Robbins has a unique quality as an actor in that he lends ever so slightly a bemused irony to the characters he plays. It is as though part of him is amused at what he is doing. I believe this is the best performance of his career, but it might be compared with his work in The Player (1992), another excellent movie, and in Mystic River (2003) for which he won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor.It is said that every good story needs a villain, and in the Bible-quoting, Bible-thumping, massively hypocritical, sadistic Warden Samuel Norton, played perfectly by Bob Gunton, we have a doozy. I want to tell you that Norton is so evil that fundamentalist Christians actually hate this movie because of how precisely his vile character is revealed. They also hate the movie because of its depiction of violent, predatory homosexual behavior (which is the reason the movie is rated R). On the wall of his office (hiding his safe with its ill-gotten contents and duplicitous accounts) is a framed plaque of the words ""His judgment cometh and that right soon."" The irony of these words as they apply to the men in the prison and ultimately to the warden himself is just perfect. You will take delight, I promise.Here is some other information about the movie that may interest you. As most people know, it was adapted from a novella by Stephen King entitled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption."" Rita Hayworth figures in the story because Red procures a poster of her for Andy that he pins up on the wall of his cell. The poster is a still from the film Gilda (1946) starring her and Glenn Ford. We see a clip from the black and white film as the prisoners watch, cheering and hollering when Rita Hayworth appears. If you haven't seen her, check out that old movie. She really is gorgeous and a forerunner of Marilyn Monroe, who next appears on Andy's wall in a still from The Seven Year Itch (1955). It's the famous shot of her in which her skirt is blown up to reveal her shapely legs. Following her on Andy's wall (and, by the way, these pinups figure prominently in the plot) is Rachel Welsh from One Million Years B.C. (1966). In a simple and effective device these pinups show us graphically how long Andy and Red have been pining away.Frank Darabont's direction is full of similar devices that clearly and naturally tell the story. There is Brooks (James Whitmore) who gets out after fifty years but is so institutionalized that he can't cope with life on the outside and hangs himself. Playing off of this is Red's periodic appearance before the parole board where his parole is summarily REJECTED. Watch how this plays out at the end.The cinematography by Roger Deakins is excellent. The editing superb: there's not a single dead spot in the whole movie. The difference between the good guys (Red, Andy, Brooks, etc.) and the bad guys (the warden, the guards, the ""sisters,"" etc.) is perhaps too starkly drawn, and perhaps Andy is a bit too heroic and determined beyond what might be realistic, and perhaps the ""redemption"" is a bit too miraculous in how beautifully it works out. But never mind. We love it.All in all this is a great story vividly told that will leave you with a true sense of redemption in your soul. It is not a chick flick, and that is an understatement. It is a male bonding movie about friendship and the strength of character, about going up against what is wrong and unfair and coming out on top through pure true grit and a little luck.Bottom line: one of the best ever made, currently rated #2 (behind The Godfather) at the IMDb. Don't miss it."	8
 Best of the best	This movie really impressed me in many ways.First of all,the actors.Tim Robbins played one of the best roles of his life,maybe, accompanied by one of the best actors of all time,Morgan Freeman.The way he talks during the whole movie,the speeches are just amazing and captivating.Definitely,the number one place on IMDb is deserved and i strongly advice all of you to watch it!I can t say more because I will reveal some spoilers and i am not allowed.Furthermore,the music is very well chosen during the entire film.In conclusion,Shawnshank Redeption is a movie about patience,loyalty,justice and strong friendship which, in this review's opinion, is one of the best movies of all time because of it's complexity:emotions,humour,depressing moments,suspense and excitement.	10
 nice movie	"The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Fotis Andrianakos	Good! Fotis Andrianakos If you are feeling like tasting something which is definitely going to tickle your taste buds, you've most definitely managed to stumble upon the right place. With this in mind, the Fotis Andrianakos Restaurant is a venue which is going to provide you with everything you might ask for out of a great meal. Things to ConsiderNow, while it's true that over the last few years the concept of eating in a restaurant has become quite popular, there are certain things that need to be taken into account. The truth is that the economy is rather shaky, to say the least, and dining at a restaurant is still considered a luxury which not everyone can afford regularly. This is what makes the choice of a great restaurant even more pressing. And, considering the sheer abundance of options on the market, the Fotis Andrianakos Restaurant can truly turn out to be one of the best places for you and your family as well as your close friends. If you want to enjoy a meal beyond your imagination, this is the place to visit.	10

 Wonderful Story!	Personally i'm a big sucker for a good story and this movie certainly offers that,the characters were well portrayed by the Actors. A movie that should be on every ones watch list. What i loved about this movie was it made a connection between the audience and the characters and i think this is a big YES when you are also trying to tell a story with the screenplay. This is also a movie that can be watched a numerous amount of times as it's a movie that leaves you wanting more as the Actors made that connection between the characters they played and the people that watched it. Come to think of it, i don't think i would change a thing in this title, to me this is an excellent example of what a movie should make people feel.	10
 Amazing!	"The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time. Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not ""some actors."" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here. Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development. I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings. Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed. It is hard to fathom that a ""prison"" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison. Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe ""The Shawshank Redemption."" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. ""Shawshank Redemption"" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within."	10
 Nerve cutting screenplay!	I can understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. Great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies.One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch.Sowmiyainternational, www.filmdonation.com	
 Very Entertaining	One of my favorite movies! First, it was a clean movie, no nudity, it was captivating, held my interest to see what was going to happen, one of the top movies in my collection. There are few movies anymore that keep the plot clean with no nudity, I understand sex sells; but I would rather watch a clean movie over some movie that contains so much nudity that your children can't watch. Again, its captivating, I didn't know what was going to happen next, Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, he played his part well, the film rates high on my chart! It makes you think of how many innocent people are actually doing time in jail for something then didn't do. Unbelievable to think he used that rock hammer to dig to his freedom. Sadly, it made me think of how many people cannot adjust to the outside world after being in prison for so many years, they committed suicide or committed another crime just so they could be sent back to prison. It does bring up those thoughts, I am very impressed that the plot held my attention and two thumbs up for choosing the perfect cast!	9
 best movie	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	6
 Great !	I can say the best movie ever, among all 100 movies you absolutely must watch before you die. As an actor, I have to say that a great job has been done. I can say there are dozens of movies I would recommend like this one. But I do not think this film is another film that can hold its place. The health of friends who make friends. I wish I could get such legendary films from Turkish cinema. People are watching such films and longing for the films that are in the old era I'm not afraid to say that again and again; BEST MOVIE. WHERE IS THE OLD MOVIES...? Spoilers can be written so much without giving. Thank you for reading, I wish good forums..	8
 Great'	This movie is great, it is a heart warming film that depicts the struggles of a man who is faultily convicted of a crime he did not commit. he is then thrust into prison where he must fight for his life day to day. he learns to protect himself and make several friends that support him while he is on the inside. this film is filled with the gruesome realities of life in prison, and the fact that men and woman every year are put away for crimes they did not commit. but none the less he spends his days learning the law and fighting to get himself out. he then provides others advice in the law, in hopes that he can help them escape to freedom.	5
 No	I'm not sorry huntsmen I view this movie but according to the ranking of this site I think it's a good movie and best-selling pamphlet of Hollywood films ... this review you are agreeing to the terms laid out in our Copyright Statement.

 A movie about patience and loyalty	Leading their roles, Freeman and Robbins are truly outstanding.This engagingly, with good heart and simple movie will entertain you marvelously.Red, is jailed because of his wife's murder. He murdered her by disabling the brakes on her car.Andy is the new one in jail, he can't get used to the new life and many prisoners think he's a snob person with obnoxious manners.Finding Red, Andy also finds a way to escape all the obscure treats put in front of him by the prison life. Starting a new life inside prison, first as a librarian then as financial assistant for the prison director, Andy goes through his conviction.But there is one secret that Andy reveals to Red that will change their lives once they're freed.	9
 Awesome	One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. This is a movie that will always continue to keep me on the edge of my seat. I give this movie a 10/10. Perfect performances.	10

 You will need tissues for tears	This has got to be one of the most emotional movies that has ever been made, written, produced and directed. It just hits all the right spots. From the beginning to the end. I won't call it a spoiler, but if you haven't watched this and are planning to; make sure to have some tissues ready, you will have shed some tears by the end of the movie. The actors do a really great job in this movie. They're so very capable of staying in role throughout the whole thing. It's a pleasure to watch because it also makes you feel more connected to the characters. This is exactly due to the actors doing such an amazing job making the characters be so alive and real. Nothing but 10 stars for this movie.	10
 Review	I personally don't like movies that take place in prisons. That is because I cant stand watching people being imprisoned or tortured in some way.And that usually happens in those movies. But this one is different. It really has an interesting story. And a good plot.ry That's why I generally like it. And the actors performed more than fine. The only reason for which I can not give it top marks is - it does happen in prison. I also had to admit that the is a yucky part. And I don't think that a person would be actually able to do it. To swim through 16m of sh*t to freedom. Freedom is valuable, but people cant do it, like they cant spread wings and fly for freedom :)	8
 Increíble	"Of the 7 nominations received he was not any. She competed against two behemoths like Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump and still no one crossed out loser. For all that we have seen swarming around the top of the biggest movies ever filmed. I was half past two stuck to the chair of cinema without even blinking hours, savoring every minute and begging to be longer, because I realized that I was watching a virgin and that this was a masterpiece. Staff face out of the room I can not forget: the satisfaction of the idiot. Silly happy face. Happy to have been part of something big, and silly because you can not yet comment on anything until this very nice feeling to go away.But the biggest thing is the last half hour. When I was asking God knows who, who Shawshank lasted longer, I gave that to me is the best outcome of the history of cinema, for the duration of your footage, for as tying each of the ends and being splendidly filmed. Half an hour we were fascinated, again, to the thousand people who would fill the then-and defunct was the largest room in Donosti. Word of mouth was the most resounding success of The Shawshank Redemption. ""Hey, you have to go see that movie, it's amazing ..."" or something like that, I guess.Based on a story by Stephen King, Darabont adapted a masterful script that was his debut. This film, say the gossip, impressed especially teens and twenties for having one of the best stories of friendship between men. Accustomed to see tough guys who crashed five, forced here to look with new eyes the protagonists and its history, just hallucinated. Personally, I think it is the most beautiful ever told about the friendship between two men history. Morgan Freeman, as we did in Million Dollar Baby, is the main character who narrates throughout the film the adventures of his friend, in the end you realize that you knew nothing.I think Morgan Freeman plays the role of his life here, not Driving Miss Daisy or Million Dollar Baby. The same Tim Robbins, his absent expressiveness think that came in handy Dufresne's character. Side, all luxury: the perfect warden, orderlies ditto captain, James Whitmore -the unforgettable older-, game of prisoners who accompanies our friends as much. All perfect. A great address with them. I think nobody doubt it.In short, a masterpiece like the crown of a pine. A film that, while not teach you anything new, makes you love cinema like few others. A photograph beautiful, excellent assembly and a colossal adaptation. Requeterequeterecomendable.MASTERPIECE""The funny thing is that when I entered prison, I was a good and honest man, and here, I have become a thief."""	10
 opinion	"Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex. Guards beat and kill an inmate. A prisoner is shot and killed by a man with a rifle. There is also a scene in which a character crawls through 500 yards of a sewer pipe filled with excrement. There is also frequent profanity, including ""f--k"" and its variations. However, the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions and a sense of maintaining perseverance and hope in the darkest of hours."	9
 Really perfect	The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite drama and crime movies.This movie has amazing editing. However of course just editing or just cast are not enough. Players choosing is very special, good and elaborate.Editing, sounds,effects,cast were all of them make this movie.Cast are very successful . The Shawshank Redemption has a lot of emotions. Audience is felling all emotions in this movie. In my opinion Andy was pioneer in all prison in the movie. All crew were make a masterpiece together with director Frank Darabont for cinema world . I congratulate them for this movie. The Shawshank Redemption is deserve first rank in all watch list.	9
 very good	very nice very interesting films 2 man coming and go prison and one man do very best things he escape and we don't know how you must watch this film how this films scenarist write this ı cant understand.when ı see this film ı am be fine.ı am very happy for watch this films.Morgan is best actor in this films and we want to see him again.what can ı do for it.ı want to be a good man.but ı am afraid of prison.did you ever seen Alcatraz.this film is good too.Clint is very good in this film.another film is great escape.and another film is Arnold play in.who is the best actor in this film ı don't know but it must take Oscar.when ı come back to there ı want to go there	10
 A brillien movie.	First, Morgan Freeman is in this movie, so before you see it you know it is going to be great. I did expect much from Tim Robbins, but from what i see he really is a great acter. After watching this movie and see it at the top on the whatchlist i was baffled. Although i do liked the movie very much i do not think it deserves a number one spot on the whatchlist. There are reasons why it was only nominated for 7 Oscars and did not win 7 Oscars. I do not say it do not deserve a spot on the top. But i really deserves a spot in the top 10 because it is a grest movie. Besides that, the ending is probably one of my favorites.	10
 The Best	One of my all time favorite movies. This is how you tell a story! Great characters and character development. The plot is perfect because you can completely understand where the character is coming from and how he got there. The supporting cast is absolutely brilliant. They not only help tell the story but become the story as you become engaged in this epic tale and can cheer for the successes and you really feel down for the failure. This is some of the best writing, casting and overall story telling you can come by. I hope they never remake this.	10
 It is a brilliant prison melodrama with an unusual title		9
 best movie ever	Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.	10
 best film		7
 Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation		9
 this is epic	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	10
 The movie of the century	It's like a masterpiece to me forever. I felt lucky to watch this in my life time. This movie has the life in it, you can see the life of a person and the way he reacts to the situation that the fate had pulled him into such a miserable thing. The direction is amazing and very thankful to him to made this happen and brought to life. Morgan freeman's one of the most influential character I've ever seen. Even in Seven(1995). Tim Robbins finest. Frank Darabont finest. A must watch movie before you die. Surely it deserves the place at which it's in right now. It will be forever in the history of movie world. A respectable film till today !!	10

 One of my all time favorites	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Definitively the Best!!	Best movie till date.If you are given a chance, that you can watch only one movie in your life ! this can easily be that one movie for lifetime. It will make you think how you have lived your life so far...or in fact how you have wasted it. It will teach you the value of freedom which we enjoy without giving a second thought. And it will leave you with a sense of happiness which you will experience only rarely.The performances are simply mind boggling, be it Tim Robbins or Morgan Freeman or countless others. And it is difficult to believe this was the debut of Frank Darabont as a director. Common life lessons, ones that everyone can relate strongly to. With so many of them seamlessly woven into a great plot, portrayed by a wonderful cast and told in an approachable form, it's not surprising that many like me consider this the most most complete movie till date.	10
 good movie	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison,but ""The Shawshank Redemption "" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicariousexperiences and quick, superficial emotions.""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice toinclude us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime,based on friendship and hope."	9
 A very thrilling movie to watch and re watch.	Shawshank Redemption: Shawshank Redemption is a classic movie that is well written and beautifully produced. With a lot of suspense and action it is a movie that everybody should watch. Tim Robbins an actor that has been in many movies such as Nothing To Lose, Bob Roberts, Arlington Road, and many more, plays an important role in the movie Shawshank Redemption. Andy Dufresne, who is played by Tim Robbins is a banker that is convicted of killing his wife and another man that she was with. While in jail he meets a guy named Red who is played by Morgan Freeman. Red is known as the ¨guys who can get things,¨ from cigarettes to rock picks he can get it all. Andy keeps a low profile in jail for the first few years. He then becomes friends with a group of guys in the jail that includes Red, but also makes some enemies. With a lot of fighting scenes it helps show the real life events of what jail would be like. On the other hand, the director does a good job in making Andy a very interesting character from his personality and actions. He is very sneaky and persistent, but is also determined and fearless in some situations. The one thing that might turn away a younger audience is the language. The Director does a fantastic job with setting the story and letting it play out but also uses a lot of language that would be used in jail. He shows how lonely, how different ,how depressing, and how life changing jail can be. Throughout the movie the audience takes away a lot of lessons that is shown through the actors lives and stories. One iconic line that I loved was from Morgan Freeman, when he was talking to Andy after he got out if the ¨hole,¨ when he said ¨Get busy living or get busy dying.¨ Frank, the director of this movie directed over 10 movies such as, The Green Mile, and The Majestic. He has been nominated for 3 academy awards and one golden globe award. He has worked with many famous and well known actors such as Morgan Freeman and Tom Hanks. The movie has won many awards including, best picture, best actor in a leading role, best film editing, and many more. The movie is a well written and well produced movie that had a lot of twist and turns that grabs the audience attention and keeps them watching and wanting to re watch the movie. The plot was well put together and flowed throughout the movie which was shown in many different occasions. I believe that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen and is one of the best movies that you will see too.	9
 wow		9
 Great Emotional Ride	in 1994 Frank Darabont wrote this masterpiece of a film, not only it will be a great experience movie wise, but emotionally it will satisfy your every need, from the beginning you will engage in a thriller like plot watching every second of it and asking questions that will be answered by the time you finish this move.if you are looking to laugh, cry, learn, get angry, get happy, and above all; have a good time, this movie will do it, i know it might be a bit long but it is worth. Great acting,directing, producing, art, writing, cinematography, record editing off the hook.great experience.	9
 one bad thing	A masterpiece! Amazing performance by Tim Robbins and the best Morgan Freeman ever. The rest of the cast is splendid and showed tremendous acting. Frank Darabont did an exceptional work respecting and bringing to the screen the style and emotion that Stephen King transmits when he writes a story. No wonder why on his first movie he received the nomination for best film. I can watch this movie over and over again and I still feel the same emotions. Doesn't matter if it is on a Saturday night stay at home movie or a Tuesday evening film on the TV. There is only one bad thing about this movie... and that is that it came out the same year as Forrest Gump.	10
 Wow!	I can honestly say, after several weeks of having seen this film countless times over, it is my favourite film of all time. Simply put. The only other film that comes even close to rivalling this masterpiece is The Grand Budapest Hotel. This film has the perfect story line with many good laughs right from the very begging however it has a perfect balance of making the audience feel good for the protagonists, and remembering what it is (a prison movie), putting the correct amount of hardship. This is a feature that so many films of today get wrong, leaving me bored in my seat. The Shawshank Redemption is a roller coaster the whole time, and shot with such class in directing. There is so much attention to detail in this film, such as Andy's and Brooks' scene in the old library where he times talking to Jake perfectly. This level of detail is unfortunately not seen today and films that are careless and without proper directorship are all too common nowadays unfortunately. I cannot believe that I hadn't seen Shawshank sooner, but I am very glad I have. I think its high esteem in my library will remain for many years to come.	10
 Best Film	I still can't quite get the enormous reputation of this film. I saw it again last night and instead of clearing up the mystery, the mystery got thicker. It is enjoyable film with very good performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, James Whitmore etc, but...the most highly rated film ever? I don't get it. The voice over alone seems to belong to a so so film. I love Morgan Freeman's voice but he's telling us what we're seeing. So, the sterling reputation damages the enjoyment of the film because one is expecting something that never, really, arrives. The most interesting aspect is Tim Robbins's psychological journey. Credible or incredible doesn't quite matter, I did go with him without asking too many questions. Morgan Freeman's humanity is contagious and inspiring, whether credible or not because I bought it. So, a masterpiece? No. Good, even very good? Yes.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	"""Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty - Sexy features not, perhaps, but how to let people imprisonment progress, life underground this story and find I have a way to fight during which you grow to about frustration. Story ""Red"" readings (Morgan Freeman), is within the walls of Shawshank prison for a very long time and it's the entrepreneur who has reported. He said that you can choose what you need: cigarettes, candy, even an amateur geologist could use a little stone. One day he and his colleagues see the latest busload of prisoners without the prisoners, and to cry during his first night in prison conditions, and those who will not. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a girl in the forest of red bet on a tall, thin man."	9
 timeless piece of story telling!	an absolute slow burning classic...do not expect and bangs ,crashes or car chases! just enjoy the sublime natural story telling of right,wrong and a mans right to do any in the wrong location! this will grip you from the onset and take you an a very believable journey... the actors are amazing but do not over shadow the real heart of the stituation...highly regarded by many as a timeless classic and it's not hard to see why...would happily watch over a relaxing Sunday afternoon wonderful! the location of the action is pretty much self contained within the walls of the prison but almost as much a true representation of the prisons man makes for himself...all emotions are raw and on display here with a just outcome.	
 amazing film	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	9
 What can I say...	I completely understand why it is one of the highest praised movies of all time because it is one of the best movies of all time. It had a great cast with amazing chemistry throughout the whole movie. Really well acted and a fantastic story line keeps you into this movie the whole time you watch it. It is one of those feel good stories that you have to like even if you don't like these types of movies. And this movie has one of the best endings in cinema history so this is a definite must watch. It was EPIC! Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect.	10
 Shawshan redemption review	The Shawshank Redemption: Accepting the bleak and harsh realities that present themselves in our lives is part of what it means to mature as a person. No film I have ever seen so deeply encapsulates this sentiment as Frank Darabont's Shawshank Redemption. Two convicted felons live out their life sentences in the Shawshank prison, usually by outfoxing guards with red's smuggling network or just rambling with old chums. The Shawshank Redemption is a masterfully crafted film because the excellent cinematography, engaging plot, and Tim Robbin's acting eloquently reflects the frustrations of a wrongly convicted man named Andy Dufresne, and his struggle to maintain one of the most valuable aspects of humanity: hope.The outstanding cinematography and drab grey shading help convey a bleak setting at the beginning of the film. Tense moments were punctuated with dark shadows cast over the actor's faces, and intensified further with Morgan Freeman's dulcet narration. The establishing shots of the prison were dull and grey, akin to the monotonous lifestyles of the institutionalized convicts that had accepted their lot in life. The somber tone created by dull colors and shading slowly captivated my attention, leaving me with baited breath in anticipation for the events to unfold.The majority of the story was set in Shawshank prison, where our main characters, 'Red', and Andy Dufresne stare the reality of a life sentence in the face. Throughout the film, the two main characters complement one another with their incongruent views of what being behind bars truly means. Red believed that they should accept their current situation and make the best of it, whereas Andy tried to busy himself with his hobbies: keeping his mind focused on things beyond the walls that caged him. I found this optimistic behavior incredibly inspiring as a viewer. There is truly a positive gem of wisdom to be found in a person who is thrusted into an impossible situation, and still finds a perseverance to escape it as Andy Dufresne did.The actors in this film performed extremely well overall, and Morgan Freeman's narration enriched my experience of this film immensely, because it complemented Tim Robin's delivery of Andy's character. Tim Robin's acting during Andy Dufresne's first interaction with Red was so well done, I felt as though Morgan Freedman's narration was manifesting on screen rather than being acted out. The entire cast succeeded especially well in bringing their respective characters to life: not forcefully exuding emotion, but casually, and crisply conveying memorable character interactions.The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful piece which stands in a class of its own: original, nuanced, and engaging. A great deal of care, time, and consideration was placed into the production of this film. I reflect back on the many other films have emerged in recent decades: films that tried to emulate Shawshank Redemption's sleek mature essence, to no avail. Truly this film stands without peer by my metric. I have enjoyed the viewing and critiquing process of this film immensely, it is truly a treasure which I would recommend anyone watch for their enjoyment as well.	9
 Excellent Movie		7
 based on a true story	Could a movie be any more perfect? This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.When this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.The story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.I love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. The cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.Overall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.	10
 An amazing movie	I have watched this movie 5 times and yes every time I watch there is something new i catch an amazing movie which requires a follow up. The acting the setting the backdrops and scenes everything is perfect. the dialogue from the prisoners to the guards really leaves you feeling a part of the movie rather than a viewer. Its a movie that leaves you wondering and thinking about the characters and what happens to them, you actually care about the characters. Shawshank redemeption deserves its place at the top and I don't think there is any movie coming along to beat it any time soon. If you want to watch something awe inspiring buy a copy of this movie you will come back to it again and again.	10
 Masterpiece		10
 Everything of an American story		8
 One of few movies where the movies is as good as the book.	This is one of those rare movies where the movie is as good as the book. Yes, it's on all the time on TBS and you have probably seen half of the movie part of the way through but in order to really realize it's greatness, you have to watch the entire thing. Stephen King is known for making so many books into movies but after being a fan of his for over 25 years, only a few of his have really translated to really great movies (The Green Mile, etc) like this one has. It is one of those movies that started out slow but has gained momentum over the years. The reason it has do so is it's pacing and great storytelling. With great story has come this great movie. I thank so many people for getting it made and thank so many people for making it so great. Thank you.	9
 Shawshank prison		
 The Shawshank Redemption	this movie is good, I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking. the show is good as said earlier because as said earlier No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge -i kinda really care about that. The walking dead ave the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption is a very good movie. i love this movie cause its realistic and futuristic, it reminds me of waling dead but overall is great.	7
 Shawshank Redemption	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" Movie ReviewA typical prison movie consists of bad food, dirty surroundings, and physically abusive inmates and guards, while ""The Shawshank Redemption"" takes this genre to a completely different level. While still including the filth and violence, emotion plays a bigger role. When directing the movie, Frank Darabont ought to have wanted to hit the entire spectrum of emotion. During the movie, the audience will feel themselves cheering from the couch, irritated, or holding back a few tears.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of killing his wife and the man she was cheating on him with, and he is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences. While serving his sentences Andy meets Red (Morgan Freeman), who slowly becomes one of his greatest strengths. Andy uses his previous banking skills to get a job in prison that he enjoys and passes his time with hobbies and devious schemes. The movie, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is made perfectly using strategic acting and not to forget about how basic the setting is.Tim Robbins does a fantastic job playing the main character, Andy Dufresne. He captivates the audience and keeps them watching his every move. He creates a walk and a way of speech for his character. I watched an interview of Tim Robbins shortly after the film was released, and I took special notes of the way that he walked into the room and his tone of voice. He talks softly and walks as if he holds himself up a little higher than he does anyone else when he is not playing the part of Andy Dufresne. During the movie, he walks with more of a lost-like stroll and speaks in a deeper, seductive sound. For a movie filled with drama, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has the most basic special effects. The story took place in The Shawshank Prison for the majority of the movie, so the only props and backgrounds consisted of brick walls, dirty floors, and rusted metal bars. The simplicity of the special effects not only contradicted with the action-filled plot, but it was able to bring the audience into the movie. Everyone can relate to being in a room with brick walls wanting to break free because of how lonely you may feel, which is exactly how the inmates felt. While the special effects and the props are basic, the plot of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" could not have been more exciting. The actors did a phenomenal job at pulling the audience into the movie and making them feel like they are there with the actors. Not only does the movie entertain the audience for a little over two hours, but it also educates the typical movie-goers on some issues in prisons in the past. At the time the wardens of prisons were finding scandalous ways to make profits and keep the money for themselves instead of using it for their jobs like they should have been doing. The purpose of this movie was to pass on the tale of the famous prison escapee and to shame the prison systems."	
 Just Gem	Shaw-shank is a fictional Maine state prison that serves as the primary location in the eponymous story by Stephen King and its film adaptation. Fantastic movie to watch and to share. Since i saw this flick I'm glad. It is a must watch for all the movie lovers. My knowledge of movie might be limited but this movie is awesome that i can tell you. it keeps you bonded with the character. And the end is fantastic. Hats Off to the team. Capture of frames are normal but have been done with conviction. The cast is good and justified the act superbly. Simple plain gemstone. Crafted with talents. Its the one of the finest movie ever made.	10
 One of the best movies	One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast gives great performance and it has been nominated to 7 Oscars. It is a very moving story and it one of the best stories. I have watched it a lot of times and it is still good. The story itself is brilliant. A banker, wrongfully put in prison would not seem that interesting, but with these people and their conversations and companionship it's certainly worth a watch. This film is that good. The great Morgan Freeman not only puts in the greatest acting performance of his life,but quite possibly the greatest performance of all time.	10

 The best movie ever made is a play of human emotions.	Sometimes you decide to watch a movie from the hype that is round it. Shawshank Redemption is one such movie deciding on which you will never regret. It is the perfect feel good movie of a man who goes down the pit of human failure but rises slowly from it through grit and determination. It is one such movie that makes you believe in your potential as a human being. There are very few movies which has such perfect story telling style as well as sequence like the Shawshank Redemption.

 Great	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."""	9
 Simply a masterpiece	"This film delivers an emotional and soulful performance. The entire ensemble, big names and small, was so perfectly cast. The brilliant collaboration between director, writer, actors and even the music department is one for the history books. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's on screen chemistry is undeniable. The narration really captures the story and makes the audience feel like they're watching real life tragedy. The director's unique take on using a blue tinted lens really demonstrated the misery and dark tone of the plot. A very powerful ""art imitating life"" take on the corruption in the judicial systems. This film will go down in history as my favorite movie."	10
 Best Movie Ever	Watch this movie for the first time as a child, then I have seen repeatedly, I think one of the best movies of all time .. the first time I saw really did not understand it well but then seeing them repeatedly I realized masterpiece that is this movie 10/10 , It is a film that I never tire of seeing, recently bought the original BluRay to have it in my hands every time you want to see it .. I recommend it to all the public , a sublime screenplay written by Stephen King and adaptation to the big screen by Frank Darabont majestic ...or say and performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, among others ..	10
 The second chance		
 My personal opinion about the movie The Shawshank Redemption		
 yes	I think that this movie has many important elements that now the whole world have missing,Poor of values how society is now with many problems how all the humans are in war. but too exist people that never go down without the circumstances, and they always have hope in their life.all the actors of the movie are important and each one has one piece important for the movie, the plot of the movie is about one man that works in a bank and his wife is in love with another man he is famous golf player. and some day somebody kills the wife and her lover, and the police think that was Andy Dufresne and the court gives him a two life's sentence.when Andy is in the jail he is alone, and he knows a good man, he starts a relationship, and some day when he and another prisoners are in jail, Andy has the opportunity to help to one of the officers and he stars to work in the library of the jail and Andy receives privileges. after 40 years in prison and many abuses to his person he can more, but he has hope and his friend. Andy has a plan and he starts to destroy the wall of his cell. one afternoon he says goodbye to his only friend, and says that he is going to wait for him and work in some beach in Mexico, but first he needs to go to one place and looking for some rock unique and see what is in there.the friend thinks that Andy is going to kill himself this night and he is worry. but in the next morning, when the official starts to say the name of each one Andy in not there and starts to looking for him. when the official looks in his cell finds that he escapes for the wall, he does a hole and escapes. Andy does his plan very well and find the man that really kill his wife, and he starts his new life, he was the first man to escapes of this prison. Andy always keeps in his mind that he is going to go out and he does, but he works day to day.and is an example for all the prisoners.Marlen Guadalupe Almaraz Martinez	8

 My perception of Sawshsnk's prison movie	The film talks us about of the situation that live the starring role Andy, between his life before to access to prison and after to escape, also the friendships who know the significance of freedom and hope. while that the conditions on the real life into prison's context is very difficult and risk; like so the life with those problems is more tedious, Andy and his friends do good things to the prison.Mister Brooks is a very important character on the story; as an example of life, Brooks is the librarian at the prison, and at the moment that he is free, he has a big depression, because he doesn't support the way that live the modern people out prison. and he decides to commit suicide for the pressure and fear, as the limits for his age and physical condition, truly Brooks inspire to Andy to keep the library in excellent conditions.Andy has many problems, but that don't stop him, with his planes for make the Shawshank's prison a better place, with the help of others, and the final part he escapes to the town and he gets the revenge of the chief in prison and captain that rapes him, stealing the money and discovering the bad planes of them with prison.	8
 The Shawshank	The movie is very good, Andy is condemned to prison, kill a his wife and lover, for sentenced to two life, being her innocent, arrives at the prison, Andy like the literature and music classic,is assaulted by mates, with the time Andy get communication with Red your friend of prison. Andy get the confidence of vigilant and person of office, makes your library and is teacher of the rest prisoners, learn to read, Andy too help to mandated do the finance but something goes wrong and mandated kill to other prisoner and by Andy is innocent, however Andy write in the notebook the finance mandated. Red your friend flatters an photo of an girl. Andy hang in his prison cell. one day Andy decided scope the prison by an hole he has in his cell.the next morning the vigilant every prisoners out of cell, Andy not come out and vigilant to look your cell and see that is not and see that has an hole.

 A fantastic movie		10
 one of the best film i ever watched	this is the movie of satisfaction, must watch film''The Shawshank Redemption'' is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Tim Robbins is really a good actor and thanks to him this movie is such a success. Also Morgan Freeman is really brought me the story. The story is excellent,the time has just flew with this movie. This movie just gets better with every showing. There's no some special effects and that is just great-just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Everyone must watch this movie.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Great Movie	The Shawshank Redemption ReviewThe Shawshank Redemption is a movie about how a man, Andy, played my Tim Robins, deals with being in prison. It is told through the eyes of fellow convict Red, played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman has an excellent voice for narrating. Andy Dufresne is wrongfully convicted of murder and sentenced to prison. While in prison he helps others to give his life purpose. The theme is about dealing with life no matter what comes your way. Andy deals with being lock up by helping his fellow inmates. Andy coping summed up best with the character Tommy. Andy helps Tommy pass the high school equivalency test. Helping others aids Andy in passing the time. Another example of this can is when Brooks, played by James Whitmore tries to cope with life outside prison. He does not learn how to deal outside the jail and commits suicide. Red says it's institutionalized; that after so long you know of no other way to live. Every man has his breaking point. Andy found his and escaped. It is an excellent movie, well written good acting and filming. The actors interact with each other exceedingly well. Making the audience feel as if the group has been together for a long time.	10

 Excellent movie	This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls!!!

 review	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.

 It's a top Notch Movie	As a movie lover, I am very fond of Action and Entertaining movies. This is the movie that changed my mind and made me matured into an even more movie lover. This movie changed me to get interest in Real life stories and started watching many movies based on real life stories. Not only the story which i get inspired from this film but also the idea-logy of living a life within beyond and as we wish. The actors lived in their characters which are more inspirational for many. There are many reasons to watch this movie but one main thing is a must watch movie for a movie admirer. Hope my review will be useful for all the people who's gonna watch this.	10
 The BEST Drama film I've seen	Personally I find Shawshank Redemption the best drama film I've seen. This is a movie that should be watched when you are at least 12. The film is based on Stephen King's novel: Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption. It's a story of 2 prisoners : Red and Andy's prison life and how both men lives are bonded for 20 years in the prison. Frank Darabont's outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's Novel. His direction and script is one of the best in film history. Morgan Freeman perfectly acted out one of the most recognisable character in film history: Red. In the film, his voice matches perfectly the tone and rhythm of the lines he was suppose to say. Although, some will say Freeman should have won the academy award in 1994 for Shawshank Redemption, I personally still feel Tom Hanks should win the award (like he already did) because although both actors' narration was extremely good, Hank's acting was better than Freeman. In conclusion, I feel Shawshank Redemption should remain it's status as one of the best drama films ever made and should be remembered forever. 10/10	10
 Fantastic	Justice, intelligence and happiness. How then do everything you want people? This movie actually gives people the answer to this problem. Great theater, great staff and a great story. Sometimes we succumb to despair or simple in our lives, that we are ashamed of our own miseries tuned in film. Life is just to believe and to hope. Even if you do not give up and hide what you do not believe that you own, I was hoping imagine, work, and until the end whether to believe it. Because, if you want to succeed and be happy, nothing can stand in front of you. Now I do not know how much you watch a lot of movies, but I'm sure that if you watch or have watched this film. This film is the best film of your life.	10
 Amazing movie and was acted out brilliantly	I thought this was one of the best movies ever made, the way all the actors play their role is great and how the movie is set out. The way they created the movie was great as they did not spoil the whole movie at the start by making it obvious that he was going to escape or that Red was going to be allowed to leave. I believe the choice of actors couldn't have been better by having Red as Morgan Freeman a man who is loved because of his wisdom in many movies and Andy Dufresne as he was not seen as an aggressive person in this witch made many people think that he did not do it as the movie went on. Overall i rated this movie 9/10 as it had nearly no flaws, the only reason i didn't rate it 10/10 is because i believe it is nearly impossible to make a movie 10/10.	9
 A timeless masterpiece	There's not much to say about this movie, only that it's an otherwordly, life-changing experience. The film deals with the themes of freedom and hope in a way that you will be thinking about it for the rest of your life. The ending always, always leaves me into tears, no matter how many times I watch it. The astonishing performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, allied to the beautiful score by Thomas Newman, complement the beauty of this movie. Unfortunately this masterpiece was released in the same year that we were presented to another two masterpieces as well: Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction, making Shawshank to be snubbed in all Oscar categories that it was nominated. But, apart from that, The Shawshank Redemption made its way into history, and for sure will be remembered for decades to come, just like Citizen Kane, Casablanca or The Godfather. Thank you Stephen King, Frank Darabont, Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Thomas Newman, and all the crew and cast for giving this masterpiece to mankind.	10
 The Shizznit	I love the story of this film. One of my favorite tales in a prison setting. Classic. I wish i knew more about the director, because the cinematography is engaging. I love the contrasts to bring out an older feel, with cold color palettes. Very flat. Its interesting to see Morgan Freeman playing opposite 'Andy Dufrane'. They have a great chemistry and on camera magic in their delivery. I especially enjoyed the characters and casting. The bully could've been alittle more menacing, but I get that there was a tone the film makers were trying to set. I would recommend this film to any student of story telling for not only inspiration, but textbook, stirring the emotional pot.	
 super		10
 Great Movie	This Movie The Greatest Ever the best one for prisons life it's deserve watching it more than one time and you won't waste your time on it Morgan Freeman made his best movie the montage was so good as it was in 1994 No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. Frank Darabont the director was amazing Tim Robbins made it perfectly i really can't say anything about this awesome movie all reviews said it already in end you will find yourself learned something after watching this movie and you will know the true meaning of freedom and how people in prison feel after 40 years in prison in fact if you miss this movie you miss your life :D deserve all the rewards,Oscars and nominations.	10
 the movie i have watched the most	"the movie i have watched the most.This is because of the amazing storyline and great performance!.Like ""Forrest Gump,"" to which ""Shawshank"" bears a coincidental but commercially convenient resemblance, this is a story of saintly endurance. Though Andy is abused by a prison bully who rapes him, a brutal guard who beats him and a crafty warden who uses Andy's banking skills to launder the vast amounts of cash he's siphoning off the system, Andy's patience, tolerance and selfless concern for his fellow man see him through.In a film that stands or falls on the central character's amiability, Tim Robbins is loose and effective, though the real performance here is from Morgan Freeman, whose projected affection for his friend really determines how we feel about him. Darabont's direction is precise and assured, without being terribly imaginative.Best,Frits"	10
 Connection of best motives	It is the best movie for the public better Never watched The bible motive is so cute I like this movie for making me feel free The characters are so real Best view of the nonsense right in the US Silence and passion . The world never be the same . If you do not see this you are not a humanist . Just brilliant ! Cinema species is to himself , that is trying to be transparent . The viewer rotates the old , well -known and a repetitive ritual , like a set of meanings and conventions . Set various potential is limited by the frame genre . Each a set of principles of quality , however, has it to himself , that is life , which turns them into worn clichéd . And when in complete defiance years sixties and seventies it seemed that cinema genres thing of the past , there was a group of young talented directors , who instead save the world , they decided to deliver the indwelling people a solid portion of entertainment.	10

 Describes the true meaning of hope and perseverance	The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont, and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman A man who plans his escape for 18 years and the only guilty man (Freeman) watches him all along but never comes to know about his plans. 18 years in confinement and still remaining sane is the true definition of someone who calls himself a life loving person. .. His struggle throughout the prison on dealing with inmates and warden and all the other things is depicted in a very surreal fashion. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.	10
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen		10
 An all time best	This is something we expect from Morgan Freeman. The simplicity of the story throughout the movie and the sudden change of mood in the climax baffles you to the extent that you re-watch the movie to check if you missed anything. The acting is natural enough to give critics a hard time finding a flaw. The message of remaining patient and not losing hope is mentioned so well that it can motivate you at any day of your life. Loved it. It surely deserves to be at the top for eternity. If you haven't watched it yet then just drop all your work and watch it first. I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com. It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch movie online.. Highly recommended.	10

 The Powerful Of Hope	"In my opinion this movie is one of the finest films made in the nineties. It's a poignant story about hope and life to the humans and That's what makes a film like this more than a movie It gives us a lesson about the value of the life and How important the hope in our life because a Human without hope is a dead person.You really will get pulled into the story as it goes on. Morgan Freeman Played a remarkable role in the movie and as he says ""Keep busy living or get busy dying"". If you haven't seen it then you should start now because this movie is really one of the best movies I ever watched.That's why I give this movie 10/10 because you will never find another movie like this taking about the Important of hope this way ."	10
 The highest rated movie deserves its position	"This highest rated movie deserves its position. There is no doubt that the Shawshank Redemption is the best in its own era, as a 1994 American drama film, and it marks the career top of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. As it is adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, the banker who was sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover. It tells the story of who claims of his innocence works his way out from scratch by a non-innocent way. During his time at the prison, he made friend with a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and got himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in the money-laundering operation. Surprisingly enough, the film was a box office disappointment, despite the fact that it received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and highly positive reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. There is no doubt that today it is considered to be one of the greatest films of all time. In 2015, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry, due to its culturally, historically, or aesthetically significance."	10
 Takes you through emotions you didn't know you had	Hope, despair, joy, they are all here. Impossible to sum up this film, but along with One Flies Over the Cuckoo's Nest it should be compulsory watching for everybody. The cast are perfect, the story-line depressing/joyous in equal measures. This 'could' be described as a film showing the insanity of the penal system, as an illustration of the potential for corruption in all institutions, but the overwhelming feeling generated is the determination to crush the human spirit. Rated as the most popular UK film, and fully deserving of the accolade, it will take you on a journey that will stay forever in your memory and maybe will shape your attitudes for longer. Simply Unmissable	10
 Must Watch	"This movie captivates me each time I watch it. This film takes you into the last place anyone would want to be and forces you to question life's meaning.The film is based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, from 1982. Andy is sentenced to life in prison for the murdering his wife and her ""lover"". Prison proves to be a tough place for him. Just like many other films depicting life in prison, Andy knows/thinks/says he didn't do it. The film makes you believe this and question it at the same time. This is one of my favorite films of all time, it is well shot and the cast is spectacular. I feel as though I am in the film as a witness at times and the first time I saw this film I thought it would go in many other directions."	9
 good	good mainly due to its goodness and how good it is, and probably that is it good too. Another great reason that this movie is good is because the great intensity of its goodness and how just overall good it is. There is this good character that does some not so good things that end him up in a not so good place. He meets some decently good people and some not so decently good people too. He tries to make something good and sometimes what is good is not always good. He then thinks someone is good but he turns out to be not good. In the end he finds what being good is to good people, and what is is not to not good people. He learns the goods and not goods of the world and tries to make the good-est of it all.	9
 One of the best movies there is	They have mixed crazy, love, joy, hate in a perfect way. This movie you all have to watch. I think more movie makers and actors need to watch this and take it in. In all these years I haven't seen something like it. This movie shows that going to prison isn't all that fun. That a lot of people sit so long it becomes their home. It's a lot of powerful actors in this movie but that is common in a lot of movies. Why I think you should watch this is because of the mix of it all. Like a good chef. Allot of people can get good groceries but only a few can cook like a pro.	10
 good	*** This review may contain spoilers ***There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope.	
 Breaking free from injustice	"This is a movie that you don't see only once. This is a movie that you keep seeing and enjoying every single time. I remember when this movie was in theaters; I haven't seen it back then and was not interested at all. I saw Forrest Gump in 1994 and for years I didn't care much about this movie that was nominated for 7 Oscars and didn't get a single one. I saw this movie for the first time somewhat 6 years after its release. Shaw-shank leaves you with unbelievable feelings of hope, freedom, friendship and an intense desire to unchain yourself. I can fairly say, with no overstatements here that the impact of this movie stays with me for several days every time I see it. It all comes down to one simple choice "" get busy living or get busy dying"". The key word here is ""busy"". When Andy finally breaks free, you don't see him at the end sipping vodka on the beach; he is working polishing an old boat and restoring a hotel in the ""hope"" of running a successful business.... Finding peace and happiness after overcoming an injustice needs you to set goals and work to achieve them. Happiness is found in the journey, on the way, not in the goal itself. Brooks failed to see it. Andy learned it the hard way and the viewers are lucky to learn it the easy way."	10
 All-time. Greatest. Movie. Ever. End. Of. Discussion!!!!	The perfect movie. Stephen King is a genius and Darabont adapted him brilliantly. Truly the masterpiece of all masterpieces. The quintessential piece of American cinema. The classic story of redemption executed perfectly. Recipe for a perfect movie=Stephen King writes source material + Morgan Freeman narrates + Tim Robbins stars, and Frank Darabont adapts and directs. This is my favorite film hands down. The scene where Andy takes over the PA and puts on Mozart is possibly the greatest scene in film history. The sequencing is truly breathtaking. The roller-coaster ride of emotion that this film takes one on is something that can only truly be experienced once, and yet with each consecutive viewing one finds new elements that enrich the viewing experience time and time again. Thank you to the artists involved. Thank you for bringing such brilliance and perfection into the world so that those that have and will come after will have a standard that one knows is unacheivable and yet one also knows that it is ones duty and that in order to call oneself 'artist', one must constantly strive for such greatness.	10
 One of the greatest movies of all time		10
 Simply incredible	"What an amazing emotional film. Performances are all top notch, and the story is so moving. Tim Robbins as the quiet and introverted Andy gives us a look at performances to come, and Morgan Freeman proves as always he can be counted on to give an authoritative performance. While the name ""Stephen King"" attached to a film might suggest something in the horror genre, this simple tale of men in prison is so much more. The sublime moments, while small move so much. And the character Brooks deserves special mention too, simply moving. Frank Darabont has created something with this film, and it will stand as one of (if not THE) greatest films ever made for quite some time."	9
 the best, cinema world has to offer you	motivational? yes definitely..A great movie to let out all your inner sorrows. its just more than what a movie can offer you. a movie which is suitable and a must watch for all. the dialogues are perfectly written that it reflects for everyone watching it, at least at some point in their life. the performances are top notch that one gets immersed into the movie as if you are a part of it and they are right in front of you. kudos to tim robbins and morgan freeman, they lift up the soul of the movie with their tremendous performances.the soundtrack is so well crafted that it'll be in ones mind for a long time. it can surely make a great impact in one's life and definitely worth a watch. no wonder its among the top favorites to most movie lovers. its rightly deserving and voted. please give it a watch if one haven't yet.	10
 Jaw dropping	When I went to watch this movie, I was feeling particularly down so I did what any normal person does and googled 'feel good Netflix movies'. Of course I had heard of Shawshank redemption- who hasn't- but I was surprised to find it on a list of feel good movies as I had always had it down as a sad, depressing movie about loss. I'm pretty sure I presumed this because of where it was set- in a prison- one of the most hopeless places a man/woman could be if you ask me. However, while watching the movie I realised I was wrong. This movie is about hope, acceptance, love and friendship a,lung many other important themes. The story line is just stunningly moving and the cast... Just amazing. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a feel good movie that isn't just another chick flick, that needs a movie that will hit home.	10
 Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free	This is without a doubt still my absolute favourite film, ever. It's a film that I can always be in the mood to watch, whether I'm feeling high or low due to the unbelievably victorious ending. The entire film is beautifully shot, with no need for any special effects and it does so well based solely on the story itself, the phenomenal acting from Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red.The basis of the plot, for those who haven't seen it (where have you been hiding?!) is Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is accused of double homicide of his wife and her lover and sent to Shawshank prison for two life-sentences in the 1940's. Shawshank prison is full of corruption and when evidence that can prove Andy's innocence is discovered, even this can't help him escape the walls, so he must find an alternative.My personal favourite scene is when Andy finally escapes the prison, after digging through his cell wall with a rock hammer, crawling through 500 feet of sewage pipes and coming out the other end with the wardens forged accounts. Andy stands at the end of the sewage pipe with his arms raised looking up to the sky, finally feeling free.Andy is also my favourite character in the film, and Tim Robbins earned his place as one of my favourite actors after this role. Andy is known to be a quiet, calm man - wrongfully accused and locked up, trying to get through day-to-day of his sentence. Tim Robbins never raises his voice above a whisper, is softly spoken and this lends itself to your feelings and sympathy for Andy from almost the very start of the film. His relationship with Red is a thing of beauty, showing two men from different backgrounds - one actually guilty of murder - becoming close friends with mutual respect for each other.There is no part of this story that isn't incredible, the film doesn't drag for one moment and you genuinely want more when the credits roll up.The film is based on the novella by Stephen King 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'.	10
 One of the few cases where I can't say the book was better	"Anyone who has ever read any Stephen King knows that a good 98% of the time the movie is never as good as the book. Usually the movie loses so much of the characters from the books. I actually didn't read the story the movie is based on (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption)until years after seeing the movie a few hundred times. That's why, when I read it for the first time I was very surprised to find myself saying ""wow, the movie actually followed the book!!"" to the point that, in an odd coincidence, the movie was on AMC when I was in the last few pages of the story and I held off onreading the last part, Reds talk about Hope, until it came up in the movie. And, as I was reading, even though the book told us Red was in fact a white, red headed Irish man, I heard Mr. Freeman telling me the whole story as I read it."	10
 Love u M Freeman	This movie was acquired the best marks in IMDb and I also agreed to this rating. This movie was authentic. When I was 17 years old and I am supposed to be a fan of M Freeman I felt very proud. I thought I am a fan of Sir M Freeman and it is a great honor for me to be a fan of him.I am Bangladeshi. I love the film in which Morgan is involve. He is an iconic creature I have ever loved.In this movie I always felt a thrilling feelings. My father always suggest me to watch movie with real feature of life. And still I am trying to do my best to take the best key note from every movie.Love from Bangladesh.	9
 The only time I'd call anything The Best Film Ever Made	There is no denying that this is a very good movie. The acting is great and it tells a good story. Personally, I find it a bit too long and a little too sweet for my taste, but its far from a bad film. On the other end of the spectrum I have yet to understand why this film was nominated for as many Oscars as it was and why so many people have fallen in love with it. To place it on the same level as The Godfather and several hundred other films has to be the result of different tastes.This is a film that should be seen because its a good movie, not because its a great one.	10
 A movie of how Planning and Effort always wins	The movie sheds light on how having a positive attitude can bring great results. I loved this movie because of the situation that the main Character found himself in and his ability to over come his present position. It has some dark scenes of prison life, but it brought truth and grit to where the movie was going. It's characters where real and the acting was fantastic and believable. But what brought me to tears was when it seemed hopeless and our main character seemed as if he would never get out of his plight. And what made me cheer was the turn of events,because of sheer determination. And how through all of his adversity He was humble, intelligent, and clever enough to fight his way to freedom and while he did this. He made a lot of his fellow inmates who might have had no hope, gain a new since of hope, love, and respect for each other. And the nail biter? He brought the wrong doers in that prison system to justice.	10
 The best movie ever, without doubt....absolutely best of all the time, till now	Can I write in my language? of course you won't allow me.... lolShawshank Redemption.... So this movie is worth for 1st top in this list with the highest rating.... This movie is old, same as my age.... with not very original story, but have the best twist plot ending ever..... I could say WAAW at the end of movie.... But narration from Morgan Freeman , the god lol, very stroke my heart....Tempo : Slow, but the scene was very detail , every scene watched without bored Act : All god level Camera : The narrow area of the jail, can be exposed hugely Ending : The best Ending ever, I cried for the ending... surely cried like a babyWell, if we can rate it in 100, I will give my own at 101 for this damned movie :)	10
 The Greatest Motion Picture The World Has Ever Seen.		10
 A Masterpiece	This movie was truly excellent and deserves its place as a masterpiece. There just is no other movie that compares. The character development in this movie was incredible. I never would have imagined that a movie about prison could have turned out so interesting. The environment of the movie displays prison as a dark terrible place which nobody wants to find themselves. It's definitely dated when compared to the modern prison system of today but still shows the brutal and harsh reality of finding yourself as a inmate during this time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an incredible job of allowing the viewer to fully connect and to sympathize with their plight. The movie was also very filled out with many other interesting characters.	10
 what an awesome movie	this movie is just what you need to watch if you'r board it will make your day awesome, and that is what happened with me! the movie is full with drama.action and also mysteries in fact it contain a lots of violence stuff and in the end i just want to say it's a great movie and that is all what i just want to say good night and sleep well and be optimistic.than you for your reading	7
 Good Movie		10
 Great one time watch	"I've watched this movies just because it's the highest rated movie of all time. Also everyone I know who's had watched this movie prior to me was going like, ""Greatest crime movie ever"". Honestly I don't think it deserves that title. There are lot many and way better movies than this one. But talking about this one in particular, great screenplay, good character building, more than sufficient suspense, and a good old ""Happy Ending"". Great one time watch. The concept of taking few pieces of concrete every day out of the wall and throwing out in the open seems a bit absurd to me, I mean that process would take ages to dig a hole through wall and then out of the prison through ground and that to big enough for a man to pass comfortably."	7
 All matter about how make difficult things easy	There is a lot of subject learning here,best to me is to break the cover of the religion and discover of the lying by the name of religion,you can learn how to put end to pain,how to put start to hope,how to hang up your hands when they want to hangs your ideas. I love every moment of this film,every smile,every hope note,every amazing sound of Morgan freeman,its not important to get Oscar for best actor,the important To get our hearts when all people forget Oscar and remember The thing touch their heart most,the thing belong to their tears The thing make them crying and loving at same time like football crazy fans This movie make us.it make us shouting and crying like goal in last minute in football for club we loved.	10
 one word...perfection!		10
 Freedom is nothing but the ability to be better.	"If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. The film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil.Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word."	9
 Amazing	One of the best films i have ever seen. This film is interesting and very clever at times. Defiantly worth watching at least once in your life. Although long this film is not slow and excites you to the point of wanting more. The ending was very good. The ending is sort of predictable if you think about it enough but ties up the story nicely. Morgan Freeman plays the character Red very well (like Morgan Freeman does) and is the narrator too since the film is narrated by Red. It shows what prison is like very well. Like i said before it is in my top 10 favorite movies next to movies like Rocky V and For a Few Dollars More.	10
 A must watch movie build on family concepts of beliefs, hopes and redemption.	The movie sets an example of the impact the world of cinemas can induce on us. In the current scenario where the movie makers, directors, all look to lure the general public with science fictions and other high stuffs, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION takes a rest. It creates its story around traditional background of common characteristics like hope, belief, self-esteem, transformation and most important redemption. The movie is set on location of prison, that is quite a thinking, say innovation in this field as well. The best thing about the movie is the fact that unlike many movies which focuses on hero, this movie focuses on the surroundings. In that way it binds us to the surrounding and helps us to live as a part of movie with respect to common persons. We find ourselves in unison with the feelings of sorrow, hope grief, etc. While maintaining the poetic and moving dialogue, Darabont also proves that a film can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience with its dialogues only. Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings. It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know. Coming to credits away from acting part, Roger Deakens have done a beautiful work as far as cinematography is concerned. The positions of camera and the awe struck beauty of prison shown in starting scene is just mind blowing. Thomas Newman's music enhances rather than informs, and there is a subtle touch in the way deep bass rumblings during the early murder are reprised when a young prisoner recalls another man's description of the crime. Darabont wrote the film to observe the story, while a little focus on punching it up or upstaging it. The actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. The movie is really a not one timer. You can taste its flavor again and again. The movie will tend to bind you in its surrounding many times and in years to come.	10
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty"	"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	
 A Good Movie, but Definitely Not Number 1!!		6
 Everything a movie should be and more		10

In fact, ShawShank Redemption is the best movie in the world	10
 Geeat movie		9
 great cinematography!		7
 If you're going through Tough times keep going	One of my favorite movies of all time. The fact that he crawled through the tunnel of excrement get to freedom helps me in my daily struggle. Keep going, don't tell anyone of your real hard work that you do secretly behind Rita Hayworth, and definitely do things to pass the time while you are escaping your trap. Pure life lessons right here in this movie, I will keep this in mind when I write. The actors in this movie were amazing. Each character was brilliant. The main character did so many great things for the people around him that it shows you how much kindness in such a terrible atmosphere goes such a long way. So many valuable lessons in this movie.	10

 Most perfect movie with perfect acting	"I watched this movie more then 10 times. Each time I feel thrilled. Excellent movie with amazing concept. If anyone want suggestion for good movie, I always keep this in number 1. There are two great actor in this movie. I like their acting so much. One of them is still thrilling Box office. He is a legend. You know who he is, Morgan Freeman! There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately."	10
 lovely movie	"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him ""a particularly remorseless and icy man."" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. ""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,"" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. ""I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.""By : JANET MASLIN The New York Times Published: September 23, 1994"	9
 Best Movie to watch	What an amazing movie.....Held me astonished for a long time.....what an acting by Tim Robbins....Best part surely was when Andy flee out that hell....Psychologically perfect.....I wonder why this movie has no Oscar....This is such a masterpiece..no one will witness for a long long time...How beautifully it expresses the life in a prison and reminds of bluffers who are way way ahead of our system of security and justice....Nevertheless, Andy is someone which probably don't exist in real life but someone you will remember for your whole life...someone whose intelligence and determination will leave you clueless..Good dialogues BTW....Hope is best of the things....Some birds are never meant to be caged,there features are just too bright for it...n many more	10
 Great Film	it is the Great Film of my life, when i saw the film, i realized, i can become a filmmaker of Indian film industry, then i have join to filmmaking school for study. i have done my study and diploma and realized why i want become a filmmaker, then i have trying for write the script and screenplay. i have struggle to the producer's office but i can't received any response from the producers, one day i have plan to the produce a regional film and make a film production company, i have shift to the other city for my dream, there i search a financier for the film and try to the convenience for the create the production company. one day i have achieved my goal and create a production company because of this film	9
 The life, and how to live it.	I don't know how to say about this movie. This is the movie which tells me its theme the strongest of all movie I have ever watched. I think the theme of this movie is Living. The location is the prison where most people may lost their hopes, but people lives there spend their life in their own way. There are many problems which we don't want to recognize it is true in prison. This movie shows that there are a lot of people manage to live in such a terrible place. All People have different life, and all people live desperately and all people will die someday. The way to live is different like the life. Some people finish their life by themselves, and others try to keep their life hardly whatever happened. Nobody knows what is right and what is wrong, but one thing I'm sure is they everyone can have hopes and it doesn't make us unhappy. Having hopes can lead us to our future, even if it takes a long time. I learned those from this movie. I think the more I watch this movie the more I can learn from that, so I want to watch this movie again and again.	10
 5 * Films		10
 Fantastic Movie	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shaw shank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shaw shank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."	9
 Film yang sangat menyentuh	The film always makes me a passion for making movies. With Very nice script backed by directing perfect make this film will never be bored to be watched. I might already some time watching this movie, however the sensation I get always vary when watching this movie. And do not forget how this film inspires us, that never loses sedetikpun expectations. Because of the hope it will make us survive, however Despite suffering we alami.dengan storytelling is not too fast this film is very nice to enjoy, like listening to a song that we like and will never be bored for us to listen to. I think it would be difficult to find a film like this again in a few years.	
 A truly iconic and classic film!		9
 excellent prison life style	this movie make me happy and have a lot of + positive energy i suggest this movies for all to watch BTW Superb visuals make this a bit more than just glorious mindless fun. If you probe too deeply into the premise you're not going to have any fun, but fun is what this movie offers, glorious mindless fun and, above all, fabulous apocalyptic visuals of twisted metal, crepuscular landscapes, dark hulking ruins, and men crawling through them to fire off weapons at the evil birds, which look very graceful as they sweep through the skies and spurt out long expanding streams of fire The other large positive factor is the very solid, mostly English cast including a number of appealing youngsters	10
 One of the best movies ever!	"One of the finest films made in recent years.The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly the best movie ever. I had heard a lot about this movie...never knowing what it really was but today I'm really amazed by the story and the acting of the actors...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving.A true masterpiece by ""Frank Darabont"". I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw TheShawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships,hopes, and dreams. After watching it for over 2 hours...you will understand it is definitely worth it!! OVERALL RATING: 9.8/10"	10
 UN film exceptionally	A film that I highly recommend to everyone! First from the beginning makes you think , this movie is not for lazy people who do not like to think so warn you'll have some days to contemplate after you see this film.The authors are brilliant , the film creates a pleasant atmosphere and is clean and quiet whistling story line to follow.Secondly I think it's one of the best films making part of films before the 2000s, the golden years in my opinion.In conclusion , I invite you to watch this film and I hope you enjoy second fire seen , because you discover a secret of life for many .So watch it and enjoy because i have only a life and you need to live it in the right way , i mean watching movies !	10

 Greatest movie ever made?		10
 One of the best movies I've seen	I had heard a lot of buzz on the Internet on how this is one of the greatest movies of all time. I had never seen it or never knew what it was about so I didn't get it. Finally about six months ago I got a chance to watch it and let me tell you, all of the buzz was right. I won't spoil anything, but just take my word for it. The acting performances were absolutely amazing, the story itself was based off of a Stephen King novel so you its source material is going to be good, and I finished watching the movie with complete satisfaction and even an urge to watch it again. This film is a masterpiece and is most definitely worth seeing if you haven't already. It is an absolutely stunning piece of cinema.	10
 One you could watch over and over and over and ......	"One you could watch over and over and over and ...... This film literally takes you on a ride where you experience just about every human emotion possible. I love the way this movie speaks to you in regards to struggle and perseverance; to never give up. The acting is overall excellent in my opinion with an array of characters and personalities, some you adore, some you despise. This film kind of reminds me of ""The Fugitive"" theme, but with the main character restricted by prison walls, guards and other prisoners in his search for the truth, which he stumbles onto by accident. The climactic ending leaves you feeling ""free"" and will have you ready to watch this captivating film again! I would highly recommend this movie!"	10
 all time favorite	This movie is an all time fave of mine. the story telling is brilliant and the acting excellent! it is a story of a very long friendship between two convicted men. they go through rough times together in prison but also have the occasional happy moment they share amongst themselves as well as a well mixed bunch of other inmates from all sorts of walks of life. Eventually the pay off comes when Andy finally receives his small tool for rock carving and we eventually find out he's been using this tiny hammer, the size of a pinky finger, to ever so patently dig himself out of prison. The sheer amount of years it would have taken him to do so is unfathomable! The ending is amazingly sweet and it makes for a feel good film over and over again! happy watching	10
 Nothing like The Shawshank Redemption	This film of the nineties was issued in 1994 And be the owner of a prominent layer serious and intelligent character then Zjk with criminals and murderers in prisons Shawshank Redemption environment for the murder and killed ?!This type of movies or stories possible we followed many of them in these years, but strongly this output? I can not imagine.Actor Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have played their role very excellent, I have not seen for Tim, but this film indeed.In fact movies jailbreak Tsthoeni strangelyNothing like The Shawshank Redemption	10
 One of the greatest movies of all time	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie where you are connected to every part of the movie, from the setting, to the characters, and most of all the ending.This is a movie that feels like an experience.You will feel amazed by every scene in this movie you start to enjoy it more and more as the film goes on. You feel the brutality the sadness and at the end the hope. The movie starts a little slow but after that it turns into an amazing film experience that has amazing character interactions between andy dufrane and his growing friendship with red. It has a nice hopeful vibe in the middle even when things go bad. Its a movie that you must see at least once in your lifetime and is easily one of my favorite maybe even my favorite 10/10	10
 One of the best movies of all time.		10
 Must Watch!	Yhe Shawshank Redemption has earned a reputation for being one of the most popular films of all time. Despite an unimpressive performance in the cinema box-office, it regularly tops 'most popular movies' votes. Tim Robbins said of the film: 'Why has it endured? ... The reason why it's had a profound impact on people has a lot to do, I think, with its spirit, and the hope within it. The idea that over a long period of time, someone's ambitions can come true, that resilience and persistence pay off.This movie is about a man who discovers himself after he is sentenced to life in prison.Andy plays the role of the innocent man, who is doing time for a crime he did not commit. Andy Dufresne is a banker before he was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Andy is shipped to Shawshank Maximum Security Prison to spend the time of his life.Andy slowly becomes friends with Red, an experienced lifer and his gang. Shortly Andy also becomes popular with the prison guards also the vicious Captain Hadley offered him protection against the jail's not so friendly convicts in exchange for financial counseling.The warden also takes benefits from Andy's banking knowledge by exchanging privileges for creative bookkeeping. Over twenty years of time in prison Andy is able to maintain his sanity and dignity by his mental force.	9
 wow!	"One of my all time favorite, Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent. Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever. The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words"""	10
 Best of All time	The movie is all-time best movies and my favorite I highly recommend this movie for everyone to watch this movie. Overall the movie is about not to lose hope and pursue your dreams no matter how long it will take. This movie is also about patience and working towards your goal and also working towards achieving your dreams and making your dreams come true. I think this movie is also about inspiring other and being a useful person when you are in you worst conditions possible and no matter where you are you have to be a useful person. After Watching this movie you will see life in a different perspective and will change your way of thinking for sure. so if you haven't watched this movie yet then you should watch it because it's amazing.	10
 The Best Masterpiece	"This is simply one of the best films ever made in the History of motion pictures.It's a poignant story about hope and the power of friendship.The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. I enjoyed the entire story from the beginning to the end and I would watch this movie everyday all day because it is very outstanding compared to other movies of this age. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith, in a dark atmosphere. An outstanding film dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoners. Many social problems are discussed here. The picture earned a well-deserved best picture Oscar nomination. It certainly should have tied with the winner, the equally good ""Forrest Gump.""All in all, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remains one of the most spectacular films I have ever seen - a master piece of art"	10
 Note about the movie in the 20thcentry celebration	I Loved this movie. PS:From August 29 to September 1, 2013, a series of events were held in Mansfield, Ohio, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film. The events included a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, where it originally premiered, tours of some of the filming locations, and a cocktail at the Ohio State Reformatory which posed as Shawshank State Penitentiary for the film. The cocktail was attended by actors Bob Gunton, Scott Mann, and James Kisicki, who signed autographs and shared stories with the fans. Director Frank Darabont sent a video greeting the fans who celebrated the anniversary. More than 6,000 fans of the film attended the events.	9
 10 movie	I really loved the whole movie, the performances of Freeman and Robbins the enjoy every moment, you hooked from the beginning and then not the want to let it go, This couple is magic, their connection in the scream is simply art. A film full of injustice, hope, struggle, perseverance and friendship. The courage of our protagonist is suffering every minute. With a shocking and awesome finale. The atmosphere of the film also helps dialogues to build amazing critic about topics like freedom or the perception of justice. I mean, you don't have to be an expert in films to watch this amazing movie, enjoy the beautiful moments in the films. Just sit down, enjoys and suffers with this film.	10
 Shawshank	This movie is a very good look into how easy man can get corrupted in prison or on the outside. We see that with Andy and how he became bad while he was in the prison. Also that we should have a program for prisoners so can adjust to the real world. I think with this brooks would have made it. I can see that we as a society need to have wake up call from this movie to stay strong and not let Satan get the best of you. By not giving into temptations and don't go chasing waterfalls.The most overrated movie of the century. Shawshank is the perfect example of a film that can fool you into thinking it's great. It's mawkish, fantastical, sappy and manipulative. It's merely good and it's laughably that people actually place it next to masterpieces such as Rashomon, Citizen Kane, Notorious, Apocalypse Now, 2001 and Raging Bull	10

 One of the greatest films to come out of the Hollywood system.	One of the greatest films ever made. It is not by accident that Stephen King agreed with this adaption of his work because Mr. Darabont did the work justice. From script adaption, to the casting, to the overall aesthetic, this film is truly a masterpiece. Not only does Morgan Freeman find rare form with his performance while making this work, but Tim Robbins showed his unique styling as well. This is simply a work of brilliance, and I can only hope that films like this will continue to be created for the world to enjoy. Kudos to the creative team, and all of those who put so much work into making The Shawshank Redemption. I will always have a special place in my heart for this film.	10

 Amazing	Flawless script, awesome direction. This film deserves to be on the top. The suspense is all there till the end. Acting is superb. Cast is superb as it should be. Feel of this film take you to the spot. It really does give meaning to the redemption. It is the film for those who enjoy every moment. Not for action lover. It's a slow pace movie. Wait till the end to feel the meaning.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian.Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.	9
 Movie #1	"The best way to spend a lazy night. it's deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film. Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes out of nowhere in the sense that it is a first feature film by Frank Darabont, who, with this one work, declares himself a special talent. He adapted King's story for the screen and insisted on directing the story too, much in the same way that Sylvester Stallone could not be pried loose from ""Rocky."" Guts equals glory. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. A 21-year friendship between a lifer (Morgan Freeman) and a New England banker convicted of murder (Tim Robbins) is the focus of this gripping 1994 prison drama, capably directed and adapted by Frank Darabont from Stephen King's short novel Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. A passing reference to The Count of Monte Cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling"	10
 Best movie I've ever seen	I was stuck in the world of shawshank, It was so good I just didn't want it to end. A must see for every human that live and will ever live. Morgan freeman killed it. with. his godly voice, and just the script and everything a.bout this movie was written and combined in a nice harmony that keeps you stuck and mesmerized in front of the screen. Even though this movie. is from 1994, it is a must see, you wont regret it I promise you that Even though this. movie is from 1994, it is a must see, you wont regret it I promise you that. Even though this movie is from 1994, it is a must see, you wont regret it I promise you that.	10
 This film manages to redeem Hollywood	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clich's and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.

 Poignant story of men from different socioeconomic backgrounds rising above...	"I cried. When I saw this movie at at theater in mid-town Manhattan I found myself at a low point in my life. On a whim I chose this movie not really knowing anything about it and not being a regular movie goer I took a chance. The struggles that the main characters endured resonated with me so much so that I cried. It's unusual for me to cry especially when the story line can be loosely characterized as ""male bonding"" through hardship. All in all I found myself watching this movie a number of times over the years since it first came out in the theaters.It's uplifting and gives one a realistic perspective of what a segment of life might have been like in the 60's, I think that's the time period this movie is placed in. The ""good"" guy sticks it to the bad guy and the bad guy's eventually get their freedom which they savor immensely."	9
 Love this classic film	"One of the best movies of all time, HANDS DOWN! This movie was very well shot and when when watching this movie you really forget that it is a movie at all. You really feel for horrible how the system did him and the worst part about it the reason that the movie is so real is because this happens everyday in real life and what can one really do about it???? it seems that it is nothing one can do. The system want to ""repay"" you by giving you money and saying sorry, I mean really what does this do when one looses so many years of there life for nothing. We as a society really need to figure a way to not make costly mistakes like this that could ruin a person life."	
 nice movie	"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy is befriended by contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance, and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is then transferred to another prison. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people, including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters asking the state government for funds to improve the decaying library."	8
 A Cinematic Masterpiece	Best film ever made, a cinematic masterpiece. Well acted and with a moving, engaging plot, this is a must see for any wannabee film buff. Featuring a stunning soundtrack and superb direction by the fantastic Frank Darabont (of whom i am a big fan, The Green Mile, The Mist are my other two favourites of his). The performances in this film are perfect, both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give career defining performances which will never likely be topped. However, these two. alone do not overshadow a phenomenal supporting cast. In conclusion The Shawshank Redemption is an emotional roller-coaster it can make you laugh, cry, smile, frown, but when the end credits roll everyone can surely agree that what they have just witnessed is a artistic, modern cinematic masterpiece, a thoroughly re-watchable, timeless classic. In short, SEE THIS FILM.	10
 One of the best movies ever	If you haven't seen this movie you must. Great story and acting. A Stephen King story in a prison?Morgan Freeman gives his best performance to date and the same applies to Tim Robbins. Little bit cliché, but interestingly twisted story: innocently imprisoned for killing his wife. while having his struggles in prison, he finds a lifelong friendship. Dialog is good, excellent story telling. Technical execution is masterful. Highly recommend to buy it on DVD or blue-ray. Watch it whenever you are down, it will give you plenty of positive thoughts. I could go on, praising the film, actors etc, but instead just watch it and you will experience and understand it's powerful message.	10
 Superb		10
 Redemption	"A definition of ""HOPE"" which you won't find in Oxford, this movie never fails to get me out of depression. To be honest, synonym of ""hope"" is ""Shawshank Redemption"" for me, the plot is kind of unexpected and that meaning, the soul purpose of the movie which is explained at the end in that letter. The lessons this movie teaches will help you every now and then in real life. ""Some birds aren't meant to be caged"" will destroy the limits you had set for yourself in your mind. This movie is my ultimate weapon to get out of depression and hard times. ""Every man has a breaking point"" but this quote when followed by ""Hope is a good thing"" makes sense. That's the simplicity of the movie."	10
 life is too short to be wasted	this is more than a film. this is story of human being.all I can see is suffering of peoples in life . we are all prisoners of this world. we live with each other and at the same time we are alone.why we live ? where are we? what is the main reason of life? who is satisfied with life? if we want to escape from this condition, where can we go?is there any real friend in our life? how can we maid our wishes?Why is it we can't turn away when this film pops up during one of those weekend marathons? We've all seen it before, we know what's going to happen, yet we still delight in re-experiencing the struggle of these character to overcome overwhelming odds. Why is that?Is it something spiritual? Something deep within us, a yearning for universal absolution the film provides? Or could it be something more Earthbound? Perhaps, something more closely tied to our own biology? One can't deny the Christ-like symbol in Andy's final gesture of triumph, yet why then does the film work for all regardless of belief?	10
 One of the Best!!!	I have watched this film more times than I care to remember, yet I am still mesmerized by the characters, the fickleness of humans and how greed and power corrupt a person's reasoning.As always Morgan Freeman's acting is so perfectly understated and Tim Allen was a perfect choice.The most poignant moment and the part that I remember primarily is the female Italian Opera being played over the speakers to create complete silence among the prisoners as they listen to what may be the first female and the first music since being a prisoner.A complete cult classic!!	9
 My Shawshank Review	I really enjoyed this one. The lead actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. I never felt like there were any scenes that left me feeling empty. There were parts in the movie that I felt like I knew how the emotions of the characters actually felt. Needless to say I believed them. I find it hard to watch movies where I don't believe the characters in the movie. But these guys really did their job. Of course I usually find myself enjoying the roles that Morgan Freeman plays. He's got a great knack for this sort of stuff. I was really glad that I watched this one and will watch it many more times in the future.	9
 1 of my top 10 of all time		9
 Literally perfect, deserves #1 Top rated movie of IMDb	"When I first saw the movie, I thought to myself, I don't know that this would be worth my time, it just seems like some odd drama..."", but being #1 top rated of IMDb, along with Morgan Freeman as an actor, certainly helps boost the chances of people watching.Luckily, to my surprise, the movie turned out to be emotionally heartwarming, filled with an excellent narrative and story that it tells. All the characters have fleshed-out personalities and interesting conflicts that keep you reeling for more. One thing that's good to note is some of the twists the movie delivers, whether that be an unexpected death that leaves you shocked, or a surprising twist that leaves you wide-eyed in your seat.By the time the movie ends, it's like you've been deprived of a drug. One of the best, if NOT best, movies I have ever seen. Hollywood could learn many things from movies like this."	10

 such a nice	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole.

 Great Film		10
 Really good movie		9
 It just gives an energetic feeling deep inside and boosts the morale.		10
 Greatest Film Ever	The Shawshank Redemption is just an epic masterpiece. It's a movie everybody should watch once in their life. Frank Darabont put together a legendary film, which at the time he probably did not think it would ever get this big. Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, Gill Bellows, Tim Robbins, and the rest of the amazing cast gave their performances of their life's to make this movie such an exceptional one. Looking back at the 1994 Oscars, in my opinion i think it should have won Best Picture over Forest Gump. Honestly, i don't think there is a single flaw in this movie. Its one of the most iconic films ever made. Thomas Newman as well, did great in composing the score for the movie.	10
 Great piece of cinema!		
 best story ever	"I believe that this film is the best story ever and One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life i remember the first time watching this My brain was bleeding this movie gives you a feeling that is hard to get this day. simply a true masterpiece. and now for who don't know the story. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton. ( b**tch be cool its my first review nobody begins perfectly)"	10
 Masterpiece, Just Amazing Movie.	"Brilliant story and brilliant performance by whole cast and crew. This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last.One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance.One of the most touching moments in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a scene in which an elderly convict, who has spent the better part of his adult life locked up, is brokenheartedly paroled into a modern world that is as alien to him as his outdated suit and boyhood memories.The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie"	10
 Unrealistic.		7
 Great!	Excellent movie, hands down a classic. This is one movie that doesn't ever need to be remade, because its pretty much flawless. Not only do i love this movie on a personal level, it has also been used as a learning tool in many schools. It teaches great lessons, and has a great, diverse cast. Morgan Freeman is great as always, and even people you haven't heard of before fill the shoes of their characters with ease. I would recommend this movie to pretty much anyone of all ages.It also is a movie that you will NOT fall asleep during. Once you start, you can't stop. A movie that will move you, whether you thought so or not. This movie deserves to be on the top of the charts when it comes to rating.	
 Shawshank Redemption	"Shawshank Redemption is a movie about faith, hope, and the friendship of two men, Andy Dufresne and Red, the movie begins with Andy, a banker that is incriminated by the death of his wife and her lover, and Red a prisoner of the Shawshank jail. This two men meet at Andys arrival, the first impression of Red is that ""he won't survive his sentence"", but with the days, Red realize that Andy is different from the others around. Andy makes a plan and with the help of his friend Red,loyalty and faith, will find a new reason to live. In my opinion it's a great movie, the movie plays with your mind and feelings, i mean, you are so concentrate in the plot that you ignore the hidden subplots, those that are important in the end of the movie and surprise you, the actors are amazing, Morgan freeman as Red was incredible. If you want to see a movie that makes you feel excited, worried, sad and happy, Shawashank Redemption is for you."	9
 Top Films	This is defiantly one of the best films out there. From the writing of it to the acting to filming of it. Everything is on point. It's one of those films you can watch over and over again and still enjoy it every time.Also there is a reason why it took so many Oscars and nominations. I have not met a person who has seen the movie and has not liked it or said something negative about the movie. It's the execution of the film that makes it so great. The story is quite simple but you watch it and are completely captivated by it. The acting is just completely phenomenal. The characters are so real and unique in every way.	10
 It's very nice	"Shawshank Redemption takes place in the jail named Shawshank,everything begins with a banker named Andy that is accused of murder, when he gets into jail he meets Redd(Morgan Freeman)that later on becomes his friend,while they are in jail Andy discover valuable details about the case that get him to jail. The movie was release in 1994 and it take place on the years 1940-1960,the director is Frank Darabond. The plot of the movie make me keep my interest on it. The way they manage to tell the situations in a chronological order and make the situations be related one to another making it find a way to solve it. The very last part make me stand on the edge of the seat even though the ending is expected and its obviously that some things will happen make you get anxious because of it. I recommend it,maybe nowadays is a little old but is a great movie,it keep you interested,it make you realize some things that happen in real life and you begin to think and see with ""other eyes"""	9
 Incredible movie	The movie Shawsshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne who is a convicted because he supposedly kill his wife and her love, The narrator is Morgan Freeman as Red, a man that has been in the jail for a long time, Andy is a banker and has very determinant personality. Andy helps the warden with financial things, he is a librarian and he makes the prison better. I like the movie because it show difficult situations in life that you have to face. The loyalty of Red and Andy is beautiful, you can know that in life there are real friends, Andy strengths proves that always you have to stay strong and solve your problems. Shawsshank redemption have the highest score on many trustful pages, there are many beautiful teachings about life. So what are you waiting for this incredible movie?	9
 An excellent movie to watch	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about loyalty, time and a friendship, of Andy and Red that starts in prison. The movie is narrated by Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been inside the walls (Shawshank prison) for many years, his character get everything you want like: cigarettes, posters and more inside prison. But the story begins when Andy Dufresne, a banker outside, is accused the murder of his wife, so the police sent him to the prison, but he is allege innocent. As years pass, Andy gain the confidence of the corrupt warden of the prison , so he will change positive things inside the prison. In my opinion its a beautiful movie and i recommended to watch because its excellent and have many values and shows a person that in times of hardship, still seeing the life beautiful."	
 awesome	This movie is about a man during the middle of XX century that gets imprisoned because of an act of injustice, when he enters the prison he starts to socialize with the prisoners and to improve the economic life of the guards and the warden, also he improves the conditions of the library and makes different favors to receive stuff from different people.I really enjoy the movie, is not the typically action movie, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat, also all the components, the music,the expressions, the dialogues, everything perfectly fits.I would recommend the movie because is one of the best movies i ever see, it has a very good argument, the details of the different scenes, like the woodcarving, the police beatings, etc, that gave a realistic touch to the film.Also this movie makes you keeps your eyes open to watch everything it happens.	10
 Very good movie	"The shawshank redemption is a movie directed by Frank Darabont,and it came out on 1994.The movie is about a man (Andy Dufresne) who is supposedly guilty of killing his wife and the lover. When he arrives to prison,Andy is very shy and quiet.But after a month he decides to talk,and meet some friends,especially Red (Morgan Freeman).During the time in prison he realize the hard situation there,and corruption.However Andy gets through that and face the difficulties.Because his life out of the prison as a banker,Andy becomes a very important prisoner in shawshank. Its a very recommended movie,because it shows how is the life in prison,different but no far from reality.Also the movie give us a very good lesson:""Sooner or later,the truth always comes out"""	9
 An amazing movie!	Shawshank redemption movie is about a story narrated by a prisoner named Red, who talks about his experience in jail, and the faith he lost since the beginning. Then a new prisoner got into the jail. Andy, that proves to Red that there's something to fight for, their freedom. The whole story teaches that if we have faith combined with hard work nothing is impossible. Im my point of view, the movie was an amazing film, it talks about hardships, friendships, dreams and hopes. The most amazing thing is that even the difference between the situations that happens in the viewer life, and the one that is happening in the movie, it makes you feel what they are going through, watching from the point of view of people that we consider bad, wrong, poor and making you reflect about many things in life. I really recommend this movie because I think that it don't only diatract but also teaches.	10
 Happiness is more simple than we think		10
 One of my favorites	"The movie ""Shawshank Redemption"" was film in 1994 by Frank Darabont . It is about of a man named Andy Dufresne that is accused of the death of his wife and her lover, that why he gets in to the Shawshank prison. We have to remember that Andy was a banker and a educated person to be in jail, so this cause that inside he makes things , special instructional , because he doesn't like the way of living of the prisoners . All of this produce that the Shawshank prison gets recognized, so the warden will effectuate everything to keep him in. Inside the prison he makes friends and made all the prisoners be grateful with him, because of the things that he does for them that wasn't allowed and he gets punished only for their happiness. I really like the movie, it is interesting and all the actors concentrate in their role, so you trust them and make all the characters feelings very special. Every situation in the prison makes you thing if is true that if in that way they care the prisoners and if is like that how you will live in a prison. I seriously recommend this movie although it isn't new, it would be one of my favorites"	8
 Close to perfect		10
 A twist I never thought of..	This movie is one masterpiece. I would say that excitement Became Double as u reach the end of the Movie. You can not simply guess what is going to be the next move or what actually is going on behind all this , a Little hammer can not dig a Hole but, when it comes to 20 years it does. I was literally shocked to see when Jail superintendent Started throwing pebbles around, and across the wall and one accidentally Penetrated in One of the Wall.It was like Oh my god moment for me .. and the whole Movie Takes a sharp Turn and rolls on.... This is superbly composed Famliy Movie and the Morgan Free Man did it like ever he does.I would recommend this Movie to all My family and Friends.	9

 the most downtrodden film Oscar 's story?	The Shawshank Redemption and the film better assessed from IMDb with 9.3 , and was also considered the Oscar of the most downtrodden film in the category of best film, The Shawshank Redemption fact is a great movie , the more it was so wronged I disagree , in my opinion Forrest Gump is Pulp Fiction are higher , more talking about the film, the script of the film is excellent, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are a great duo, the two make an excellent performance , the cast is excellent, the soundtrack is very good, and the film is full of memorable moments , such as when the character of Tim Robbins puts the microphone a song for all the prisoners to hear, and at the end when he finds the character Morgam Freeman , I found the good rhythm , the film not enough to be long , the direction is great , the Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that would rather win the Oscar , most do not get to be wronged as people say .

 Good	"The great sleep gamble People who do not get enough sleep run the risk of developing serious health problems including cancer, diabetes and heart disease, experts have today warned. The British public has been accused of becoming 'arrogant' in ignoring the vital importance of getting enough shut-eye each night. Smartphones, social media, tablet computers and watching television in bed, have all been blamed for interrupting the body's production of the sleep inducing hormone melanin.'Metabolic health, in addition to genetic predisposition, is largely dependent on behavioral factors such as dietary habits and physical activity,' experts wrote in The Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal. The study said that addressing some types of sleep disturbance – such as sleep appeal – may have a directly beneficial effect on patients' metabolic health. But a far more common problem is people simply not getting enough sleep, particularly due to the increased use of devices such as tablets and portable gaming devices. The disruption of the body's natural sleeping and waking cycle, often experienced by shift workers and those working at night, has also been found to have a clear effect on metabolic health, as well as an increase in rates of chronic illness and early death.The prevalence of life-threatening health problems, including cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease is increased in those who compromise on their sleep, studies claim. Professor Russell Foster, at the University of Oxford, accused people of being 'arrogant' in turning their back on years of evolution that has seen the human species rely on the sleep cycle. He said: ""We are the supremely arrogant species; we feel we can abandon four billion years of evolution and ignore the fact that we have evolved under a light-dark cycle. What we do as a species, perhaps uniquely, is override the clock. And long-term acting against the clock can lead to serious health problems."" A person's body clock is, in part, driven by exposure to light and a need to sleep and rest is the product of a time when people were active during the day, resting at night. But modern life has interrupted sleep patterns. A 24-hour society coupled with technology disturbs the natural order, leading people to sleep at irregular times. Experts said smartphones, tablet computers and social media keep people more alert later into the evening. The blue light emitted by the devices has a shorter wavelength than whiter light, acting to inhibit the body's production of melanin - the hormone which induces a need to sleep.Havard University's Professor Charles Czeisler said: ""Light exposure, especially short wavelength bluish light in the evening, will reset our circadian rhythms to a later hour, postponing the release of the sleep-promoting hormone melanin and making it more difficult for us to get up in the morning. It's a big concern that we're being exposed to much more light, sleeping less and, as a consequence, may suffer from many chronic diseases."" source: Daily Mail Nehézségi saint: középfok"	10
 Get Busy living or get busy dying!	Get Busy living or get busy dying! this is why i watched this movie in 2016.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. But when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.	8
 Prison break	Andy's prison break is the hardest part for me to fathom. For 20 years (time frame uncertain), Andy graciously digs his way out of that prison. Not realistic for me, but it does shows me the prisons we create for ourselves that may take years or even a life time to get out of. I think this is the message I get from this film. I liked the film and have watched it several times. I always felt connected in some way to the message it created for me. The message of being a prisoner of our own problems and world's we've created for ourselves from our human nature environments to fashion such prisons. We try as much as possible to get ahead in life and there is always something standing in our way from achieving our full potential. This film represents our own prisons we create for ourselves or the prisons we let others create in our lives as we allow them to control us. The final outcome however, is escape from the prison.	9
 The exact way to embrace Life.	"An audience watches a movie to find a way to get comfortable which they did not get in their real life. A movie is said to be a movie, only when it has reached up to its extreme positions in fulfilling an audience emotions and feelings. This is the movie that made me think about audience, how they will react, how they think about the characters. Its all about excitement and anticipation that reveals at each moment that is the exact reflection of real life dramas, where they cannot overcome at any time. ""Shawshank Redemption"" made me think, man this was what i always wanted to be, but could not become what i want, could not choose the way i wanted in real life. This movie motivates me to go through the stages that you will get unprecedentedly, unexpectedly in life. Every scene is a realizing part of life that most of the people would not dare to do it in fear. But this movie shows what exactly you can earn, when you overcome that fear. I recommend this movie for everyone who is searching for a way to find themselves, to become stubborn, to forgive, to overcome fear and to enjoy life."	8
 94' overwhelming film	"this is the best film that has ever been made. No apologies to The Godfather: Great film, but this.... THIS is the culmination of perfect casting, narration, slowly-developing scenes, film score... There's not a single moment in the film that I can point to and claim that it ought to be different.﻿ There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two. A MASTERPIECE."	10
 good	"good film very interesting to watch. Age rating suitable to film genre.This i8s a strange thing to says about a film set in a prison but it has a way of creating a warm hold on our feelings Va's it makes us a member of a family.Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions.""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.It buses the narrators calm,observant voice to include us in the story of the men who have formed a community behind bars.it is deeper than most films;about community in a lifetime,based on friendship,hope,redemption and belief.The only their film to have moved me in such a strong way was ""To kill a mockingbird"".Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.This is one of those film's cancan watch over and over again and always pick up something new from.A must see film."	5
 Best Ever Movie i have seen so far.	Of course this is the best movie i have ever seen. because it is all about the study of stones. You can't fight faith. I love this movie and all the stars and cast in this movie. i don't know why i love this movie so much but it is the best movie. Tim Robbins was the best choice for this movie as he is a good actor with full control on his acting and feelings. As we all know that Morgan freeman is the best actor and was the best actor. Morgan freeman increase the stars of this movie as he always help the movie to get on the top. Bob Gunton was the best choice for a jail Admin, So he performed very well as other actors did. So all over i am giving 10 views on this movie i don't know why i didn't watched this movie in 1994 in cinema.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	"Its one of my favorites. I can't really say anything that hasn't been said already. Great acting, great cinematography, great story, great ending and the list goes on. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are wonderful main leads and the supporting cast does a great job too. Roger Deakins is great as usual, capturing the feel of a real prison and its inmates. Just likes his other film ""The green mile"" Frank Darabont can really work with his actors in a prison setting. Film deals with many themes and it all works without feeling too crowded.I really can't think of anything really bad about this film. Just go see it. It has rightfully earned its reputation."	10
 Introduction to understanding pain	The movie is a supply train of pain, and as it lays the tracks slowly out for you in order to trek down the stone walled path of an apathy driven environment, it almost instantaneously begins to conduct a subtle inference to hope, like an orchestra testing it's tools, you can hardly hear it at first, and it's chaos barely mimics sounds of redemption. Though once broken free from the cold tomb of realization that suffering is in fact guaranteed for some over others, you feel a certain appreciation for the experience you yourself will never have, a certain jealousy even. After all else has subsided, you'd like to believe after our own battles are over, they'll leave no laceration but only scars, but even scars can hurt still when winter comes, and when re-watching this movie, I still fill the cold pain in my thoughts from when I first viewed this selection. A great movie, one which endows to its viewers only a subtlety artificial sense of life in a prison.	9
 Well worth watching		10
 A Masterpiece of film.	Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion one of the best films ever. It is a great film because of its amazing performances given by the actors. Some amazing writing, directing and overall atmosphere. This film is very good as it captures prison life very well and its story is magnificent having the Characters changing around and doing certain things that push this film along. This film feels like it should be a TV-show as there is so much that happens in this film it could easily be a 6 episode series. The characters that are introduced through the film only add more elements for the characters to play off of making it very easy for the actors. I don't need to say much more, this film is a masterpiece, you must watch this film at some point in your life.	10
 Serving two life sentences back to back	Although there are some Stephen king story lines that work better as a book and not as a motion picture, Shawshank Redemption is a classic. It seems like every time Frank Darabont and Stephen King come together the outcome is phenomenal. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is accused of murdering his wife and is sentenced to Shawshank prison for two life sentences. The extremely aloof character offers a powerful performance as he adjusts to his new life behind bars meanwhile planning his very long and patient escape. Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) befriends Andy while offering an incredible narration throughout the movie.A definite must see.	10
 Masterpiece Cannot be repeated.	"The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	10
 Not in vain on the first place	One of the best themes for motivational movies ever chosen and one of the few movies that you see and understand differently every time you watch it again. It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge.	10
 One of the best movies out there, If you have not seen it, Go on Netflix and watch it	This movie is by far one of the greatest compositions out there. It constantly engages you without having gun fights or explosions. It intellectually engages you. It invites you into a whole new world, into the minds of convicts. It all ties in perfectly with its ending and seeing corruption being overthrown and justice winning. It makes you root for the bad guys for once. Overall it should be on everyone's top ten lists and everyone should watch it. Also, the casting in the movie is phenomenal. Morgan Freeman is perfectly cast for someone who has been in prison for ages, he perfectly fits the role of the old dog. Tim Robbins did not receive enough credit for this film. He seamlessly blends into character from an actor. He is cool under pressure, intelligent, and a little bit scary. This movie is probably going to be superior to almost all other films for many years. It is a timeless classic that almost brings you to tears.	10
 A beautiful fable for Now	I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.	8
 Better than you'd expect	Not what you'd expect, better than what you'd expect. I liked it in many ways, after being told to see it by many people i final watched it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I now always think of shawshank and pulp fiction as my most favorite films, i have also noticed that they both have rape scenes in them...what a second what does that say about me (not much) . i'm not going to say much about it but i love the ending and i love how you don't think they are going to make it out. for dome reason the film has a lot of rewatchability to it, in the way that there is always a reason to watch it again, as you notice more each time and you see the characters in a different light each time you watch it. or at least thats how i felt watching it.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), andpredicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red."	10
 Shawshank Redemption Dynamics	"The film The Shawshank Redemption is about Andy Dufresne, a prestigious banker ordered to serve time in prison for crimes he was found guilty of, however he claims that he has not committed. The film mainly follows Andy and his ""friends' that he has made in prison around their day to day lives. From working in the prison or what is like to be in your cell by yourself at night, it also follows Andy through his plans and is most definitely brilliant and unbelievable escape.Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption is a film about hope and persistence and the rewards for being hopeful and persistent. Throughout this film the main character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) shows that by being persistent and hopeful you can achieve whatever you want. Red (Morgan Freeman) is a character who plays the devil's advocate throughout the film; while he supports Andy and everything he does, he also manages to make it seem like his actions are pointless and a waste of time, however Andy did what he wanted and did not care what others thought, thus reinforcing the theme of persistence. The film uses Brooks (James Whitmore) actions to exemplify the decisions that are made when someone loses hope and does not have the persistence to move forward. The sound effects of this film are key to the added sense of realism and dimensionality of the film. Such as the background noises like small water droplets to the right up front noises like the slamming and locking of the prison cell doors. Other things such as background music are used to set the theme of the movie and the scene currently being viewed, while the background and foreground noises add depth and dimension to the film immersing the viewer and giving the sense of physically being there. Sounds like those of the prison cells, water droplets and the absolute silence of solitary confinement exemplify the theme because to survive all of that you have to have the determination, persistence and hope in order to move forward and survive. The director, Frank Darabont, used the cutting and duration of scenes in order to reinforce the theme and convey the emotions of the film. Such as when there is a dramatic/sad scene the panning is very slow and the scene last for an extended period of time with soft music playing in the background, thus providing the feeling of hopelessness, loss and sadness. On the other hand he also uses this technique to convey happy scenes in the film, such as when Andy's schemes went to plan, the scenes were very bright, usually with upbeat background music and were brightly lit. All in all this movie was done very well and tells the story while trying to immerse the viewer into the film. The story being that by being persistent and hopeful you can improve your always improve your situation and maybe achieve redemption for the wrongs that you have done."	10
 Excellent movie Must watch!!!	Its a great movie.In the first 70% of the movie you can not assume the ending. And when you see the climax. The word WAAOO automatically comes in your mind :)Its a movie without any action seen. Its a move about to cheat the corrupted policeman's and a hard work by a person. Andy takes long time to finish his job but when results comes its awesome. Brilliant acting by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Bob Gunton. Must watch!!!Its a old movie so for now it will be available in maximum country local language.	10
 good	Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a prisoner in the gloomy of Shawshank after being found guilty of a crime he claims he did not commit. The film portrays the man's unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise long-term inmate named Red.

 Genuine Work of Art	"Film Appreciation is a course that many college students will take throughout their educational journey in hopes to pass time in an interesting manner while fulfilling an elective. That is my purpose of this review; to fulfill a requirement. However, choosing this film was very deliberate. Upon seeing the list of films to choose on a weekly basis of the course, I knew I would save the best for last. The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. Giving special care to camera angles, costume design, lighting, transitions, sound effects, and Morgan Freemans god-like voice the creators have produced a film that will stand the test of time. Fulfilling my first requirement I will introduce our notable characters; Tim Robbins plays the mysterious main character Andy Dufresne, next we have the renowned Morgan Freeman playing Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and Bob Gunton starring as the Warden. Each character does an outstanding job making you believe you are experiencing a real-life tale. They possess human-like qualities that are relatable for all which aids in the emotional connection the audience is sure to form with this film. Andy has the will and drive that most people can only hope to possess in their lifetime, while Red is down-to-earth but extremely resourceful. The Warden is cruel, blinded by greed and power which most people in his position would likely succumb to regardless of what they think they would do. These three powerful characters are aided by many background characters who offer humor, softness, or harsh reality. The central theme of this film is that hope exists for all, we just need to never give up enduring life along the way. Peculiar theme to standout in a film encompassing the life of prisoners, but regardless it is my personal take away. We primarily follow the flashback of Andy who is serving two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, but along the way there are other characters who receive special focus in order to evoke unavoidable emotions. We see the different sides of Andy throughout his journey, though much of the time he remains stoic as to not give away key plot points to the audience or even the characters within the film. Given the heavy dialogue and emotion there are many ideas to take- away from this film; you will just have to watch it yourself to experience them all. The most important factors of this film are the use of transitions and sound effects. Since the film takes place over a span of many years it is important to allow the audience to experience the passage of time correctly or the illusion is lost. Changing between slow motion and fast paced transitions, the film layers sound perfectly to the changes whether it is off-screen sound or visible sound made by objects on the screen. Some scenes fade away to aid emotional response, while others flash through quickly in order to give the audience of sense of the effect of the entire action going on in the scene. Combining the believable acting, with an emotional yet oddly- relatable theme and brilliantly done editing/sound effects, The Shawshank Redemption is a film that every person should watch at least once in their life-time (though I recommend more than once to really take it all in). It is a genuine work of art which I will gladly watch any day. (Especially gratifying when it can be used to fulfill a college requirement)."	10
 An amazing heart warming film	An amazing heart warming film that displays human connection, emotion and friendship. One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The story is such a simple yet powerful embellishment of the human nature, the value of human interaction in a prison facility and the notion of time or rather the use of time in said prison. This film is so heartwarming. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. If you haven't seen this movie, go grab it now. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. A must watch!	9

 The Definition of a Perfect Film.	From the opening score that introduced me to the monstrosity known as the Shawshank prison to the visually stunning scene with an amazing score to match as Morgan Freeman strolled alongside the stone wall up to the tall oak tree, every moment was more memorable than the last. This film is not only in an isolated category of movies that define what true filmmaking is, but it is at the top of it. The impact of this film surpasses the average moving going experience so far to the point that it has effected people's lives personally, along with my own. One of the reasons why I decided to become an actor this film will not only live in my heart as the greatest film of all time, but i'm sure in all of the world's as well.	10

 The Shawshank Redemption review		9
 One o the best movies I have seen till the date	What an extraordinary movie?! Must watch for every film lover. I have seen more than 15 times and yet not satisfied. Every dialog is a gem.This movie has not have a single unnecessary line.Morgan Freeman's VO is fantastic. There is so much good about this movie that words aren't enough to explain that.If you haven't see then go watch now. Deserves to be No.1 on IMDb's top 250 films list. As the original novel is fantastic so does movie but the treatment is very very good. Art department has done a great job and the movie looks like to be from 1940s. Cinematography is also very good and so does the acting department. But once again its proved that the story is always a king and sure will be.	10
 The great movie	"Perhaps Shawshank didn't take off in popularity until it hit the video market because it is a very intimate and quiet film. The story was too ""personal"" to be viewed in a large theater but best viewed in your pajamas in the privacy of your own home, a place where you could allow yourself to sink completely into the story without being distracted by the nearby sounds of strangers. Stephen King's stories and novels are written with a great deal of inner dialogue and make for difficult adaptation to the screen. This is a beautiful story of struggling in a hopeless and oppresive world, while being unsure of deserving to hope. The scene where Andy played the aria, watching the effect of the soaring music on the faces of even the hardest of the prisoners in the yard, is awe inspiring."	10
 must watch	"rightly known as one of the best movie of all time. got some great actors. whats better than morgan freeman explaining LIFE! great acting and direction. the end dialogue on ""hope"" is also great. shows you the character of people in prison. One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks."	9
 Excellent movie	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.

 The best movie I have ever seen.	"The best movie I have ever seen. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. Then the end of the movie I was speechless. The story is awesome as the character. The producer choose actor very carefully. I think every character is perfect!!! Morgan Freeman one of the greatest Actor. And as well as he played an important role in this movie. 1st time I didn't understand why the movie is top of the IMDb list. After watching this movie I understand ""Why"". The best movie of the Movie history."	10
 Brilliant	What can be said about Shawshank that hasn't been said already? Nothing. It's a must-see for anyone at any age. Well acted, beautiful cinematography, brilliantly written. Did it get robbed of it's Best Picture Oscar? I mean, it's better than Forrest Gump - for sure - but better than Pulp Fiction? That's a rough decision.From the opening of the movie to the very end there is no downtime, there are no shortcomings. The opening of the film might be one of the best openings of any film that I can personally think of. The sweeping view of the prison yard - that is cinema magic how they timed and planned out that scene.	10
 Best thriller movie	This the best thriller I have ever seen. Morgan was awesome in his character. Although it was a box office disappointment, the film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. Though the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio, served as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary. Although a large portion of the prison was torn down after filming, the main administration building and two cell blocks remained; the site was revisited for filming parts of the film Air Force One	9
 An excellent movie about 'Do not lose the Hope'		10

 I love The Shawshank Redemption, it make people to have hope and faith.	This film is not just one story. It shows a human being in deeply. It shows the friendship of criminals in jail. Hope is dangerous, but you need it to push you to make something. As the movie say, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies. I love the way to show the story the director did. It is a brilliant and wonderful work. He tries to tell people an objective social phenomenon. The main role tries to break it and throws it away. He wants to have a good life. As the most people think in the world. It pushes people to change our old status. It also make people to have hope and faith. This film is not just one story. It shows a human being in deeply. It shows the friendship of criminals in jail. Hope is dangerous, but you need it to push you to make something. As the movie say, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies. I love the way to show the story the director did. It is a brilliant and wonderful work. He tries to tell people an objective social phenomenon. The main role tries to break it and throws it away. He wants to have a good life. As the most people think in the world. It pushes people to change our old status. It also make people to have hope and faith.	8
 Best film i've ever seen	I never knew that I would like a film about life in a prison but when I saw this one I was so glad that I tried to watch a film about being a prisoner. Tim Robbins played a very good role but I was more entertained by Morgan Freeman who played a very nice person called Red which was a friendly man where you didn't expect from that he was in prison because of killing someone. The film includes some beautiful scenes, for example the scene where Andy Dufresne arranged some beer for some prisoners. From the moment you met the boss of the prison Warden Norton you hate him and you want him to get sacked. Also one of the leaders from the prisoners played by William Sadler is an asshole. The end of the movie was for me a unexpected one. I thought Dufresne wouldn't make it in prison and that he would take suicide. But he escaped and that scene was terrific. And the most beautiful scene for me was the ending of the film where Red and Dufresne met each other in Zihuatanejo. So, this is a brilliant film and unbelievable that this film wasn't a huge success when it was in the cinema. It tells you a true story about life in prison and I suggest everyone to watch this film.	10
 All time favorite	This film is one the most emotional and sincere movies on the cinema history. Actually everyone should watch it, and i am sure that everyone can see a lit bit of himself/herself while watching. I cannot think anyone for the supporting actor rather than Morgan Freeman, obviously. Although it seems to be long film, i can assure you that you will go with the flow of the film's atmosphere. Some of the scenes are a little bit offensive but since this is a real time story, we can say that it is OK. Also, thanks to these scenes, mood of the film is much more sincere. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. As i said earlier, everyone can see some of their life's in this movie. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. Everything is much more higher than you expect. So, trust my word and go watch this perfect film.arinc	9

 Highly deserving of all of the praise it has garnered	There is no denying that film is tough to watch, because it is. It showcases the horrible injustices of the American Justice System. However, it is more than this. It is a character-driven film that emphasises how the everyday individual man can respond to imprisonment.Nowhere is this better explored than in the character of Brooks Hatlen. SPOILERSSeeing him become institutionalised and becoming terrified of the world that he has been released into was absolutely heart-breaking. It is a complete tragedy when he kills himself.The Shawshank Redemption is a story about redemption, a story about forgiveness, a story about justice. Watch this film! You will not regret it.Read my full review for more: http://goo.gl/3A30Bu	9
 Hope and courage	"I watched this movie for the umpteenth time probably last Sunday and how much I loved it yet again!!! A movie I would never ever get bored of and definitely, one of my all time favorites. A simple yet wonderful story about HOPE!!! HOPE – One word that drives all of us and gives us reason to live. We push ourselves through our mundane lives in the hope of achieving / finding something that we dream of. In the words of this movie's protagonist – ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""!!! Superlative performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.A must watch if you haven't!!!"	9
 Very Well-Made and Interesting		8
 Excellent		10
 Classic	Best film ! I like so much. Unique !!! But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is Great Entertainment	Stephen King is perhaps among my top three favorite authors. As a lover of horror works, I have long enjoyed King's unique imagination when it came to creepy tales. The Shawshank Redemption, though not a horror film, is as much a joy to read as is his stories of the macabre. The film version to King's novel has been out for several years now, and yet I still find myself enjoying it just I did when it first premiered in theaters. I am not one to spoil an experience by mentioning specific scenes, so I will just say that if you are a Stephen King admirer, as I am, you will love this film! If you haven't seen it yet, please set aside time to do so. It's a great movie!	10
 Cool Movie		10
 nice movie	"very motivating movie, Best movie i have ever come across. These movies are evergreen. Watching them never tiring.The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience."

 The best movie for the worst period of your life	At first I thought this will be a movie about some guy in prison who faces problems and overcomes with his goodness.I want to skip watching it(because I don't watch movies giving messages which are not possible practically).If I would have done that, my life would not be as great as it is now.It changed my life a lot by making me believe in hope.I suggest every human needs to watch this movie. No wonder it is top movie of all time.It shows the power of hope.Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman brings life to their characters.I haven't seen any Frank Darabont movies but I can say it was his best.If you are in bad phase of your life, I suggest SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It will help you a lot psychologically.You wouldn't understand what I said till the end of movie. Watch it as soon as possible.	10
 11/10	"The Shawshank Redemption is about a man breaking out from a prison. At face value it seems quite clique. The ""redemption"" story as the name suggests. However, when you view it, you see it is so much more. The Shawshank redemption is about mans lack of surrender. Its about perseverance and not relinquishing. The Shawshank redemption can also be awarded for showing the humanity and good will in even the most terrible people. All in all, The Shawshank Redemption is a classic. A film that deserves to be revered and watched a thousand times.Morgan Freeman delivered a stellar performance along with a brilliant lead from Tim Robbins.If I were allowed to give this film 11/10, trust me, I would."	10
 Number 1 but not flawless ...	"One of the greatest movies ever made, is one you can watch several times and still discover little magic in the script. Like that compass to know where north is in the treasure hunt. Unfortunately, mistakes happen, even for the number 1 rated movie. Repetition in min 42 and 25 when Andy wants to ask red for a special delivery.Basically he uses the same line, and in real life, especially in a prison situation, that wouldn't have happened. ""I understand you're a man who can get things"" basically the same line Andy uses in both scenes and red responds also in the same way ... ""I'm known to locate certain things from time to time"" ...Despite the mistake, it's difficult to see a movie like this one in cinema these days ..."	9
 Still An Award-Winning Movie After 22 Years!!!	"I can honestly say that, even after all these years of being seen on Cable-TV and being sold on D.V.D., ""Shawshank Redemption"" is still the all-time best prison movie I have ever seen, bar-none. In fact, I want to go on record of saying that it's a real shame that it didn't win any or enough Academy Awards, because God knows it deserved to. At the very least Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both deserved a nomination for their performances, because they always put out great performances, now can anyone on this site dispute that, yes or no? And of course I can also comment positively on some of the other actors in the movie: there's Bob Gunton, who portrayed the ruthless and corruptible Warden Norton with such flair; then there's Clancy Brown, whom I remember as Kurgan from 1986's ""Highlander"", who was excellent as Byron Hadley; and of course William Sadler, Col. Stuart from ""Die Hard 2"", was funny as Heywood; Mark Rolston was okay as Boggs; Gil Bellows, who was Tommy who knew the real guy who killed Dufresne's wife and lover and was killed before he could tell anyone else, heck he looked like he did some Elvis Presley impersonating in his time; and let's not forget the legendary James Whitmore, who played Brooksie, enough said there."	10
 Must see		10
 Classic film!	I wanted to watch for a long time as it had good ratings and is Morgan Freeman's arguably his best performance. In this movie he plays the role of a prisoner inmate known as 'Red' and landed up in the Shawshank jail for murdering a person. Tim Robbins portrays an another falsely accused inmate known as Andry Dufresne. He had been convicted for murdering his wife but in reality he hadn't.The movie meticulously shows Andy's life in prison life. There are many scenes which just stole my heart such as some phrases,etc. One may say it is a bit slow moving and lacks a coherent plot but nah, it was a well written plot. Well it is actually based on Stephen Hawking's novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption'. Towards the end of the film, Andy Dufresne escapes the Shawshank prison through sheer hard work. He had been chiseling through a well to make up a tunnel. Towards the end, 'Red' ( Morgan Freeman) is acquitted and meets up Andry Dufresne ( Tim Robbins ) . The cinematography is also good.This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever made in the course of movie history. Man, the acting of Morgan Freeman is just too good.	9
 Happens to be the best movie I have ever come across	There's a bunch of lessons in this movie that I'll encourage every entrepreneur to look into and any person who wants to be successful. The lessons contained in this movie hasn't got a price tag. Some major lessons I have learned in this movie are 1) persistence, 2) Never lose hope 3) Don't be afraid of what people say or being different 3) Always have a good heart 4) Never stop dreaming 5) Give before you receive 6) If you wanna come out clean on the other end, you must be willing to swim through rubbish 7) Get busy living or Get busy dying My advice for anyone going for this movie will be 1) Eliminate any form of distraction when watching 2) Watch more than once	10
 This movie still holds up to its magnificence.	The Shawshank Redemption is about redemption and nothing but redemption so help me god! Its about what it means to get a second chance at life and about what you need to do to get that chance. I studied this film when I was in high school fell in love with it since.This movie still holds up to its magnificence. I loved discussing how it had garnered a reputation as a modern American film. I read about its release history and found out much of a slow-burning success this film was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, good old HVS. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).	10
 Great Movie	Highly recommend. One of the best films of recent times. If you haven't seen it do yourself a favor and watch it on AMC (or many of the other TV channels that air it every weekend). Or just go out and buy it! It's only like $5.99 for a Blu-Ray copy at Best Buy! You can't call yourself a movie buff or fanatic until you see this movie.Is it the best movie of all time? It depends on who you ask. It's in my top ten. At the very least go read Stephen King's novel, which the movie is based on. The book is just as good (if not better) as the movie.I feel like you're wasting your time by reading my review. Just go watch the film and decide for yourself if you like it.	
 A classic from excellent producers. Top quality presentation. Good actors, good budget. Certainly a must watch!	A classic from excellent producers. Top quality presentation. Good actors, good budget. Certainly a must watch! From the critics point of view, it took quiet a while for the story to get a direction in the plot (Escape plan). It also took a while to get the characters in place. A certain degree is direction loss with the story concerning the incarceration in the first place. As if there wasn't a great plot to convict, but a need for conviction so that the character is in place. A master piece in concealing details of processes involved. Of course, Morgan Freeman was the highlight in the casting, but William Sadler and Tim Robbins were excellent additions. Set in the earlier 21st Century during the probation years.	10
 The best movie i ever saw	This movie is brilliant, a completely genius of cinematographic art. The full details of how he can make is run away from the jail is incredible, a major lesson of art are displaced on this movie.When you start watching this movie, you don't's have any idea of what it's going on, and that's awesome, because in the end, you still don't know how it will be, so it creates a spectacular idea of you having no idea of what it is going on...The way that the main character creates to get out of the prison and to ruin the life of it's owner it's just wonderful and leaves the spectator wondering how an only person can do that.	10
 A movie made in a universal language		10
 Watch it, to have an amazing experience!	This is a classic movie, kind of an adventure which will give you goosebumps for many days. Highly recommended. This movie has so more than one story going on and it needs a real good observation to understand all the aspects. If you can watch it with film critics, watch it as they will add a new angle to watching the movie. After watching try to add some of the aspects of the movie to your life as this movie teaches us many lessons of life.It also shows to us that how harsh prison life can be and a person needs to be mentally strong to handle himself in the jail.He must also make friends in jail as they can help him.	10
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen		5
 Essential	A film must. A film that makes you love the cinema. Neither time harm . Vision must. It is much discussion regarding the actors regarding the script. Technically impeccable. Mentioning the soundtrack made ​​by Thomas Newman . Performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are particularly spectacular . Make the film more IMDb rating says it all with the number of people who voted no . It is a cry of hope , friendship , never to lose faith in oneself ... is great to see life more joyful than we sometimes think .For unusual cases such as this , it would be necessary to extend the range of 11 to vote on 10 or 12 ;)If you love movies, this film certainly will have already seen .	10

 True friendship	This film describes prison life in Shawshank prison , but not as we are used to it . So not a prison yard with rival gangs in which one has to be as cool as possible. It just describes the deep friendship that may arise . In this case, the friendship between an elderly black man who are already 20 years old and a young , intelligent and calm man who has just come unjustly serving life . This young man , Andy Dufresne, is cut from very different kind of wood than the rest. He founded a library , carves chess pieces and teaches at the less gifted prisoners. I think it's a beautiful film : Quiet and filmed decent. Emotional moments and finally quite a good feel-good movie .I am also very beautiful as they describe how the prison was initially hell. But that occurs after a period of time habituation. After lapse of further time one becomes dependent on the walls and does one just warn the outside world.	10
 Brilliant Story	"Incredible Suspenseful story telling, that really shows the human struggle we all face between LAW and JUSTICE. This is a ""must watch"" and part of my Filmography Cannon. The use of Morgan Freeman as the looking glass for the entire story was a brilliant and clever tool to have the human transition of the second person watching and telling the story. Each of the actors were given great direction as all of their choices and work, was so in line with one another. Such an incredible example of a unified project where the actors director and writer could really come together for some good cohesive work. It is what I always find that it is doing all the simple works well and playing it all together that make a movie work so well and so good. Once you have that foundation you're really able to make something even more special. You can never skimp on the foundations to try make something spectacular. Thank you for another amazing piece of film and really taking the time to make it LIVE"	
 Timeless Flick	To this day, I watch this movie at least twice a year. I love the deeper subplots that seemed so believable. The script is well written and directed. There is something to be said for a late 1990s movie that is still in circulation and used in curriculum.There is also the fact that it was filmed so much ahead of the technology we now have access to. Amateur film makers make movies on tablets. Its a grizzly reflection of how quickly life could change and the prison system. It continues to remind me of a time I will never fully understand but oddly, can deeply relate to based on my upbringing. If you are looking for a movie to watch for a tradition, this is it.	10
 Amazing Movie!		10
 The Great Movie I Ever Seen	"Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying."

 Masterpiece	This film deserves to be number 1 on IMDb! I simply love it. Morgan Freeman is a god. Tim Robbins fulfils his role so good! I recommend it to every people out there. It would be a pity to miss it... Stephen King is a pure genius. S. King is known for his horror genre, but this shows that he's a smart versatile one who can do other movie genre so well. Enjoy Shawshank Redemption, it's worth fully! I was a little kid when I first saw this film and I didn't understand all of it. Now, I can watch it over and over again and always find something new and mind blowing. I recommend seeing the movie at least 2-3 times, you won't regret it. All the best!	10
 Utterly gripping	A solid script that moves with sufficient pace to maintain engagement yet lingers on details without losing interest. This film uses narration in a way that almost becomes peripheral - you are focused on the drama yet the voice-over adds depth and explanation without distraction. An ultimately feel-good film that takes you though a gut- wrenching narrative. One of the few films that contains unwholesome language and content in a manner that seems 'natural' and not simply for effect (Billy Elliot is a classic example of such a film). No matter your favourite genre, if you haven't seen this then put aside any preconceptions and be prepared for thorough entertainment.	10
 One of best movies ever!	The movie is one of the best ever. Morgan Freeman is in one of his best roles and Tim Robbins also. When you see it for the first time you do not expect the ending. I have seen it many times and it does not disappoint me each time. This movie is in range of The Game or or Ethernal sunshine of the spotless mind and a few more, that you do not now the outcome in advance. Most of the movies - 99,5 % of them, you know at the beginning who is the ''bad guy'' who will ''win'' at the end... But you see this movies and in a couple of days you do not remember half of the movie and you forget all about it in a month or so... But there are rare movies that you see and this is one of them, that is ''with you'' for ever.	10
 Excellent movie	This film describes prison life in Shawshank prison, but not as we are used to this. So not a prison yard with rival gangs where they should be. as cool as possible the describes precisely the deep friendship that can arise. In this case, the friendship between an elderly black man who for 20 years has down and a young, intelligent and quiet man who just unfairly life is serving. This young man, Andy Dufresne, from throughout Another type of wood cut from the rest. He founded a library, carves chess and teaches at the less gifted prisoners. I think it's a beautiful film: Quiet and solid shot. emotional moments and finally have a good feel-good movie.I also find it very beautiful as they describe how the prison Initially a hell. But that at the end of time habituation occurs. After some more time, one will be dependent on the walls and does one properly warn the outside world.	10

 greatest 1	King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.	10
 my vote of 10	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Maybe the greatest film of all time	"This review will be on the movie The Shawshank RedemptionBackground information:Genres: Drama, and Crime Fiction.Directed by Frank DarabontAcademy Awards: One of the Best movies of all time nominated for Oscars but never wonMain Cast: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, James Whitmore, and Clancy BrownReleased: 1994Plot: Andy Dufresne is an innocent man sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. While in prison he forms a friendship with Red, experiences brutality of prison life, all in 19 years.Acting 9/10: Everyone did well acting but Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman really carried the movie. I especially enjoyed the narration in this movie by Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbins probably had a better performance in this movie over any other movie he has been in. I did really enjoy the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Especially the ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" scene.Overall Rating: 10/10Would I recommend it? It has a very well written ending if you do enjoy plot twists. Without a doubt watch it you won't regret it. It is after all in the discussion for greatest movie of all time."	10
 Request	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.

 The movie is little bit slow and simple but highly original	The movie ,though good,is relatively slow and simple than a movie should be of such a high rating.The major criteria of its high rating is its simplicity and the presentation of prison life in the movie which is actually quite convincing.Also the movie is quite emotional that makes you feel cry at some moments.The plot of the movie is simple and short enough.The director focuses much more on filming prison life than completing the plot which is quite good from critics point of view.We find this attitude among directors in very few movies nowadays.Freeman, as usual,out shows his impressive acting skills which adds a great flavor to its originality.But if you like action,drama,thriller movie this might not be able to cater your demands.Instead if you like to have a good time watching some fine stuff in terms of originality its a must watch.	8

 Goes better and better with every watch	It is the best movie i have ever seen.Watched it 5 years back and was mesmerized. Just can't stop myself watching it again and again whenever it airs on TV or get a chance to recommend it to someone. Usually i don't like the movies based on this theme. i just watched it as it appeared on the top and believe me it blew my mind as i finished watching it. The storytelling, screenplay, direction everything is just awesome and cannot be better. I have seen most of the IMDb's top movies. some remain on top some loose, but this one can't be dethroned. As I am watching this for 10th time(which i usually don't do, and neither do I write reviews :)), it came in my mind to give this masterpiece a tribute by posting the review. If you haven't seen it, go watch it as soon as possible. you will remember the masterpiece for years.	10

Morgan freeman was great as usual specially as a narrator. excellent performance and great story sets an example of friendship and hope. A must see for everyone.	10
 Awesome movie		10
 On of the first films I ever saw	growing up, I never really watched TV. I always loved to act, but never had enough patience to sit down and watch a full film. Back in high school my best friend was a movie junkie and he told me that I had to sit down and watch this film with him, and if I didn't like he would never annoy me to watch films with him ever again.This movie changed my life. The acting and dialog is brilliant and it inspired me at a young age to pursue film acting rather than stage.My career would of never developed if it wasn't for this film. I have now gone on to watch several brilliant films, and Shawshank Redemption will forever be in my top 5.	9
 Captivating in every aspect	"The development of the characters and story line are so intricately designed that you forget the this could be considered a ""period"" piece of sorts. The movie goer that likes authenticity along with the depth of drama ,will be pleased. The setting and cinematography for the time is on point and accurate. The relationships between the characters grow and have resolutions . Engaging the watcher to be inspired. Also, the carriage of the film over time lets you have an intimate experience with each character. The film score has a diversity of music genres and that will please many a generation, many a life lesson is conveyed thru the use of a stellar actor portraying the character flawlessly."	9
 Good but IMO not even close to some of the best movies		8
 Wow	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	10
 From the court room, to the island to the guilty verdict, the antics of the prisoners, the harsh dealing from the Governor to the guards.	Best film ever made.The movie was gripping from start to finish. Morgan Freeman, was outstanding of his character right through the whole movie. Morgan Freeman, also mad a remarkable statement when he left jail and met up with his friend to be together in freedom. Tim Robbins, was outstanding of his in depth be trail of a innocent man, right throughout another movie.Tim Robbins, his role as setting up the library and doing the guards income taxes then helping a young prisoner do to his exam for school was a wonderful concept for the jail. Bob Gunton, did a fine job as a warden of the prison and the system he portrait him self in.James whit-more, was tremendous in his role of being inside for so long and when released couldn't cope on the outside.	10
 Revelation	Intense, exciting, it squeezes the heart and mind is forced to think . After seeing this film, I have decided to make films . I'm an actor and screenwriter thanks to the emotions that gave me . And ' an intense script that runs in this film . Technically I can say I have seen some very important and profound interpretations of the two main characters . And ' a film about freedom, but a sought freedom outside the box. Patience and self-awareness leading to liberation. It is inside of all the power of the cinema, a cinema that should make us reflect objectively , a cinema that is becoming all too often trivial. Follow in the footsteps of this film will be very important in the near future .	9
 Masterpiece	"The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that will send the viewer through multiple emotions with its multi-layered fascinating plot. I often get asked by those who haven't seen the film: ""what's it about?"", but I never know how to answer that question. The truth is that I don't feel that I can briefly summarise such a stunning beautiful film whilst doing it full justice. All I can say is that I can guarantee that if you don't love it, that you will at least very much like it. It's no fluke that this film stands at #1 in the IMDb top 250.Despite deservedly winning a mere 14 awards, unfortunately this will always be one of the best films in history to have not won an Oscar, but don't let that affect your opinion."	10
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional"		10
 The Shawshank Redemption	The Shawshank Redemption is for me one of the best movies ever made. The acting is crisp and full of endless tension, sometimes forlorn and on other occasions full of fear. How Stephen King could come up with a horror story like this is beyond me. It's a real nightmare to be in a penal system with so many things going against you. Stephen King has been known for writing stories that have both confused and amused the readers. You should really just rent the movie, sit down, and enjoy this 2 hour long movie.In the end, though, while the film is indeed admirable from a technical standpoint, it is the emotional impact that has made it a favourite of so many. Naturally, emotional responses will vary from person to person but this film seems to hit the mark more than any other. Do yourself a favour and check it out.	10
 Its readily effective		9
 best movies ever	This movies is beautiful and the best movie ever it is not a movie with high rated is the best because the events in the movie are wonderful and not expected. I think the person who didn't watch this film he didn't watch movies. I don't think that the film is overrated like same people said I think ever one in the world must watch this movie. I don't know why the movie didn't win Oscar he is the best movie ever. In the top 250 movies there are a lots of movies you can find but this movie you will never find in this moment I don't know if there will be a movie high rated or much beautiful like it watch this movie and you will never forget this movie ever	10
" ""Shawshank Redemption"" met ""Forrest Gump"""	"Twenty years ago, the movie is already, but there will always be the best movie list to see it, a good thing 1994 film year, several sets of charts in 1994 were released within twenty. Today's movie will put a lot of resources on the sidelines to computer graphics, the importance of fever script, CHANKAI that there is good cause to content, reading aftertaste, again aftertaste. But also want to see the impulse.Shawshank Redemption in prison as the backdrop, the time set in the 1940s, (the actor from jail walls, affixed posters to find he experienced a year) are easy to understand all the dialogue, especially prisoners in prison mood to write very carefully , whether entering the prison on the first day, the first decade, go to the fourth decade, even after leaving prison, has been unable to meet the huge social change, so that the audience can feel it.When this film's most special places, is the use of a large part of the plot to hide the actor Tim Robbins ingenious escape plan! Sheet until the end of the dismantling of truth, can not help but admire, author Stephen King novel layout!Cinematograph James Whitmore (old librarian), live in the prison four years, regardless of the mental body, has been completely dependent on it, so once they are released on parole, as suited to the changes in society, they had embarked commit suicide a way, when you see cause for regret, but it turned out to be an episode of actor Tim Robbins Morgan Freeman worry about life after his release, and after a series of actions, and buried a volt line.Shawshank Redemption was released during the hit ""Forrest Gump"" Forrest Gump then swept the box office and awards, stole the show, Shawshank Redemption has not been much attention. But after the release of the disc, more and more people discuss the film and accumulate excellent reviews, so far is 100 IMDb users voted the best film of the first, CHANKAI think the first is not necessarily the best but at least for a class aimed at fans preferences, remember Forrest Gump in electrical propaganda, with particular emphasis on the effect of her computer, table tennis scene, also put quite a few historical figures pulled into the cinema, which was great selling point. When comparing the two, Shawshank Redemption with a plain expression, not exaggerated special effects, but the theme is always the prison audience empathy is not so heavy, and ""Forrest Gump"" is told from the child's growth from stumble . In the award-winning Hollywood blockbuster with no conditions Shawshank Redemption in 1994, we did not get a lot of people's attention.Shawshank Redemption Frank Darabont is the director's work, I have seen there, ""the Green Mile,"" ""the Mist"", is well worth watching movies.CHANKAI 2016Feb"	9
 Sheer Class...!!		10
 A must Watch Inspiring Cinema...	Watched it 20 years later the release of the flick. And I must say, its among the best Inspirational, Motivational and Uplifting movie I have ever experienced. Was unsure as to why it holds the number one spot in IMDb's title, but now all doubts cleared. People lacking HOPE, Motivation, Self Confidence should see this. It portrays in a good manner as to how a person overcomes Fear in regard of Hope. Go for it blindly and you'll never be disappointed. A man who's being framed wrongly for a crime not committed by him goes to jail. Finds some friends, some allies and some woes. But in the end the route of escape, the hope for a better tomorrow, the will for survival of a man continues. And he continues his fight silently for more than 20 years in silence. Watches all the seasons and festivities and days pass by. Thus, it inspired me a lot on a whole new scale. Even the performance of Morgan Freeman excels, so does he in every movie as usual. The Shawshank Redemption.	9

 Must see	The story-line was well thought out and had great flow. Morgan Freeman was top notch, as always. A suspenseful thriller with plot twists that will keep you guessing all movie long. Lighting was good. Composition of shots were well put together. Character dialog was appropriate for all scenes. Supporting actors fit their roles well. Do not miss out on this one. Classic film. Must see. Tim Robbins plays a great co-star role. Morgan and Tim work well with one another. Director Frank Darabont did a great job. Stephen King, as always, wrote a script that will make any avid movie watcher want to continue watching his films. WOW!	10
 Shawshank Redemption Review	I think Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies that were ever made. It has a very catchy story. I have never seen Morgan Freeman young until now. Well, he's not literally young, but, you know what I mean, younger than he is now :D The actors played very well in this movie and it has a great plot. Even though the film is made in 1994, it is still one of the greatest movies, like Godfather which I think it's the greatest film ever, although it is made in 1972 (the first part) I strongly recommend it for whoever didn't watch it yet. You won't lose your time, as I said it really is a great movie and it will bring you a smile on your face.	10
 Awesome	This movie's a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. This movie's really awesome...I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high-adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored.	9
 A true gem	"if you haven't seen this already...go right now and watch it and this is as desperate and imp as Gandalf put it best"" Run you fools"". This movie is truly enjoyed when you absolutely have no idea of the plot and I know then why would one watch it but this is just like with its continuously changing plots.. I loved it and it definitely gives you that kick when you are feeling low in life...Wow I truly loved it and I watched this with my best friends. Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself."	10
 Sawshank a timeless classic.	Being born in 1995 i feel a bit skeptical before watching movies that were made even before i was born but thank god i watched this piece of art. In my opinion this movie is a must watch for everyone regardless of the gender , age or even taste. In my opinion this is one of the best if not the best movie ever made by Morgan Freeman. His performance along side with Tim Robbins its just perfect. The script is very well written and the main characters are Red and Andy background story is couldn't be more different but at the same time couldn't be more interesting. This movie currently ranks number 2 in my top favorites of all time.	10
 Rita Hayworth and spectacular film making	"I think the reason this film stands out a classic is because it has so much heart. I've always thought the story is what makes a great movie, and this one had a brilliant one, based on the short ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. The screenplay adaptation of this short novel elevates the dialog and the moving performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman into a masterpiece. The plot twists and turns in directions that defy the best of imaginations...ones that only Stephen King could write. I am truly humbled by the writing. But as a film it is more than that. It's over-riding theme of ""hope"" transcends the message over the walls of Shawshank to the green grass, and the beaches of Zihuatanejo."	9
 The Movie Gives Me a New Life		10
 This flick will set you free		10
 Best movie of all time	"""Sometimes I feel sad that Andy is gone. I have to me remember that some birds are not born to cage. its feathers others shine. And when they run away, the part of you that I knew arrest them is a sin, is happy. Yet the place where we live It is more empty and lifeless without them. I think I miss my friend""I'm still wondering how it took me so long to watch this ingenious piece, but okay. Starting with the life lesson about ""Freedom"" that was passed:In the film we have so much to learn about it, we can see that when our freedom is cut unjustly we do not know what to do and everything points in just lowered his head and move on. But no was what Andy did, he had hope but also worked hard to (say around 20 years digging a tunnel? My God, there is perseverance). All this with patience and wisdom (The guy is f ******) And even with all the difficulties, even with all the obstacles of the Director of guards of the rows, and still getting two months in solitary confinement, the guy does not give up.What about hope: Even though every reason in the world to give up, he He did not give up, even when Red said ""Hope can leave a madman ""and he replies:"" Hope is a good thing, maybe the Best of all, and nothing that is good must die ""And even there that hole, he made a difference with their peaceful way, intelligent and both strong and then continued on.On how not learn is in the society:What happened is that the guys were both arrested time already had become accustomed to that reality, for them, it was to be free be trapped inside, the concept of freedom for them changed fully as they surrendered to it and had their freedoms cut, no longer knew what it used to be free and to enjoy to life again. We can see the example of Brooks, there even being arrested, he felt free, he was someone there and built his character there, but unfortunately ended up settling in a lifetime caged and to be returned to their free life, I did not know what to do and He ended up committing suicide. Fortunately it was not what happened with Andy, he He insisted so. Red ended up bending a little, but in the end with the help of his friend, entirely given your life back.This film is a great lesson. It is something to be taken to heart and take as an example for life. Everything about him, the construction of the script, develop the story, the flawless performances, was something millimeter worked, and think, worked very well. The characters are extremely catchy, since its characteristics to his dialogs, which are very rich, very intelligent and were used an excellent narrative. This movie made me have a roller coaster of emotions, from ups and downs, to laugh, to cry but also be moved. Anyway, all I can say is Andy and Red did give me a wide grin that lasted one hour and after the movie and I went to sleep happy. 5-star favorite, great masterpiece lives up to all excellent reviews and the excellent grades he deserves."	10
 Shawshank Redemption - An Ultimate Masterpiece	An ultimate master-piece. The best movie ever made. Period.There are movies, there are great movies and then at the end of the tunnel, there is SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. Initially, a failure at box office but a winner of hearts and emotions forever. This movie changes life, it helps people get eternal hope. The strength of the movie is its connection with the audience. One can easily relate with a scene or a character or a moment in this gem of a movie.Shawshank Redemption is a movie which strikes a chord with all its viewers. Two words that define this movie are: Hope and Friendship. It shows the ever-lasting bonding of 2 men and their journey together in the confines of a prison. The simplicity of the movie is admirable. The scenes are believable, the struggles are realistic and one gets attached to the pain and sufferings of Andy Dufresne. All the characters have done an incredible work. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) carry the movie and are outstanding to say the least.Whenever you feel sad or upset, whenever you need hope or whenever you want some will to overcome the greatest obstacle, Shawshank Redemption will uplift you in ways that just cannot be simply described in words. It will touch your soul and leave you mesmerized, captivated and wanting for more. You will definitely identify something very personal in your own life.I personally use the quotes in this movie in my real life. They help me whenever I feel depressed. 1.Fear can keep you prisoner, Hope can set you free. 2.Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. 3.Get busy living, or get busy dying. 4.On the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.It is my all-time favorite. I have watched it more than 30 times and still the charm fails to fade away. Every time it leaves me spellbound with its sheer brilliance. It gets better with every showing. The movie connects with you, it moves you and most importantly, it gives you HOPE!!!	10
 Shawshank Redemption.	This movie is probably the best movie ever made to inspire people who lack conviction and the will to push that last step which may open the door of unlimited opportunities. Wonderful acting, direction, sound, camera work and the most wonderful thing about this film is its script, taken from a short story of stephen king. Marvellous is the word to describe its narrative and story projection. I wish i can watch similar movies before dying. Frank darabont, you are a champ bro. Hell yeah! It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	
 Shawshank Redemption is a classic movie with a great cast and excellent writers	Coming from Sandusky, Ohio (about 35 minutes from Mansfield Reformatory) myself; Shawshank Redemption was an instant classic. About 2 years after this acclaimed movie came out my family had an Exchange student from Caracas, Venezuela named Christian and he loved this movie so so much. We all watched this movie at least 222 times that year. It is hard to believe that The Shawshank Redemption has been out 21 or years and every time it is on TV all I can say in Morgan Freeman's illustrious voice is Poor Andy Dufrane. Just starting out in show business Shawshank Redemption is a great study piece in all aspects of filmaking. Being this is my very first review, The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful piece of Classic American Film. This historical piece will forever live on in the Enteric plane. Thank you Mr Steven King for allowing this fabulous writing to be turned into a Movie	10

 Overrated but good	"Now, I see what everybody was talking about. It took me 4 years to see this, in my opinion, masterpiece. If you have not seen this movie rent it anyway you can. The performances delivered by Robbins and Freeman are, to me, the pinnacle of both their careers. This film cannot help but evoke tactile imagery to the fullest capacity. You feel what the main characters are going through the sensation is uncanny. Robbins (Andy) and Freeman (""Red"") are a balance of the human spirit. Andy is your freedom-seeking hope side and ""Red"" is your rational, pessimistic counterpart. Find your equilibrium in ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Now, I see what everybody was talking about.

 Best movie ever	"Watched this movie more than 10 times and I love it every time. It has all those things that a movie fan wants to see every time a press play. I usually don't like jail or war movies that much, but this one is very special and hasn't left the 1st place of my favorite movies list. The actors are superb, two of the greatest actors still in this time worked their best ever and even the ""bad guys"". Someone once told me that if you really feel like you hate the ""bad guy"" is because is an excellent actor, and it is so true! Prepare for a long couch and pop corn time but for sure, and no one ever regret it. Recommended to anyone that is willing to go through many emotions (the good ones)."	10
 Shawshank Redemption: Still stirring it up?	Shawshank Redemption showcases the best elements of human endurance. The justice involved in both sides of the fence is heavily weighted towards human dignity. It is still valid today as we look at men and women enduring prison and racial injustices involving the treatment of black prisoners. This comes out in Morgan Freeman's performance and the reactions to his parole hearings.Tim Robbin's performance, shows the utter joy and excitement of beating the system in his expressions during the record scene, and the arrival of the library. The writing and dialogue show intelligence behind the conversations of those whom are usually found to be marginalized. The character development of Red and his friends is absolutely astonishing as they play off of and rely on the validity of Tim Robbins pulling off a truly amazing performance. The Bad guy: is always hard to write about. But he did good making us hate him, whatever that may entail, bless him. The cruel scenes are depicted with horror, while withdrawing dignity from the character's card pile; and turning it over to the viewer. You can crawl into their skin, but won't need therapy. The movie IS therapy.	10
 I love it	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 Such a great film	This is definitely a classic. Its suspenseful and funny. Never left me bored once. Very well written, I fell in love with every character (except the bad ones). The friendship and bonds developed between the inmates was a thing of beauty to watch. I fell like all aspects of the prison was covered, between the downtime the characters spent, to the bets and bribes, to the inmate activities. The plot takes you back a few decades, so the clothing attire and mannerisms needed to match the era. I think the actors did very will with keeping up pretenses. Very engaging film. Would recommend to anyone with a little time on their hands and willing to witness one of the greatest movies of all time.	10
 Great Movie	What can I say... When I was a kid, I didn't like The Shawshank Redemption. In fact, I was disappointed with this movie. Because, to me, they had to be happy ever after! The years have passed, and I'm old enough now, and I felt really stupid because I didn't like this movie. Oh my god. This movie wasn't made for children, It was made for grown ups. It's language - a child would never understand the message. A child would just enjoy the pictures and the songs. When I saw that movie again, 2 years ago, I understood why they couldn't be together, I understood the message of the songs and I understood the fact that this movie is one of the most brilliant movies created.	
 Get your best friend to watch this movie with you.	Hmmmm!What a movie. My two pennies' worth is that you get your best friend to watch this movie with you, because this movie explains the definition of what true friendship entails The Shawshank Redemption epitomize everything you want in a movie. The suspense,thrills,frills,intrigue,pain,and hope exhibited in the movie was phenomenal. What more can I say about Morgan Freeman,his performance in the Shawshank Redemption was great and he exhibited mastery in delivering his lines. Tim Robbins,he truly justified his selection to be the lead actor in the movie. Please watch this movie and thank me later.	10
 when the film teaches you to live	I saw this movie the first feeling that you will try to not feel the same person. The banker Andy Dufresne, masterfully played by Tim Robbins, is accused and punished by ergs for the alleged murder of his wife and her lover. He will be sent to Shawshank Prison, where he is director of Norton, whose corruption leads to the use of convicts to be able to enrich. In this prison, much like a hell, Andy will find support as Red, Morgan Freeman in his best performance but only earned him a nomination for an Oscar. The result is a strong friendship between the two, so much so that, for the persecuted Andy, Red becomes like an island of sanity in a sea of ​​sharks who take advantage of him. But here is the teaching of the film, grown because your passions will redeem you, and you always have hope because hope is perhaps the best thing for a man! The intelligence of Andy and his hope will allow it to redeem himself and save a life ... that of Red. The considerer one of the best films in cinema history and a must see for review. I am surprised, but not that much, why did not win anything really important ... is considerable an injustice like the absurdly missed Oscar for Best Picture in Taxi Driver, 2001 Space Odyssey, Clockwork Orange, Awakenings, and Kane to the directors M. Scorsese, S.Kubrick and O.Welles!	10
 My number one	I would say this movie is the best movie made till now. The way Tim Robbins plays his part is definitely one of the best performances I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies, and this is movie is special. It has an amazing storyline and worth watching. On the other hand, it is all played very natural, for me it doesn't feel like I am watching a movie, it's like I am watching someone's memories. The way the director and writers have put this movie together, it gives me the idea I am there with them. Also, the way Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman show their emotions, you can see they are first-class actors. It is 2 hours and 20 minutes of sympathizing with the main character. There are so many lessons in this movie which you can use in the modern days. If possible, I'll show this movie to my children and try to let them explain why the choices were made and ask for their opinion.	10
 Hope	"It was the most impressive movie that I've ever seen. It taught us if you are in even in jail, you shouldn't lose your hope.Because ""Hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies."" Although there is going to be appear some unnerving problems in your life even you are rich or poor, white or black, happy or sad etc. You will have to fight all about this problems although if you feel like a weak. But if you lose your faith and hope there would no point what you are against or why you fight. Because your best friend is your hope. There is no meaning to live if you don't any hope any goals with you. Don't let them to steal your hopes from you otherwise you will just become like a walking dead."	10
 Ezcellent		10
 A testament to the human spirit	Timeless classic and doesn't have to brag itself to be known as the most riveting drama of all time, a brilliant main role combination of Freeman and Robbins, exceptionally finished. I think It was a very good movie because the story was very catching, and the film was very exciting because I got him very passionate continue to watch from beginning to end. The film, in my opinion deserve a 10/10. It's an excellent movie, it's a movie you must see. It's an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature. Morgan Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.	10

 Morgan Freeman's Best	"if you haven't watched this movie yet, you are missing out my friend. it is one of those movies where the plot moves ahead and you don't have an exact idea about what lies ahead until the final 20 minutes. Having said all that, the film is satisfying, but cloying. Andy is the minister of the healing power of hope. He educates the inmates on the healing power of Mozart. He builds a library. He asks Red why he stopped playing the harmonica. When Red replies that it's no use in prison, Andy looks at him soulfully and replies that ""here's where you need it the most."" Despite the somewhat unbelievable friendship between a white, upper-class, innocent banker and a black man in 1949, it's a valuable lesson that may seem inspired to children who haven't heard this story a couple hundred times. You would want to clap and jump out of your seat when Andy's genius and patience is on display for the world to see. excellent movie, excellent plot and Morgan Freeman's narration is the added bonus."	9
 Best Prison Escape Movie Yet	Thia is the Best Movie of Prison Escape Ever in my view as of its suspense & drama before they even escape with showing technical ways of brilliant mind ..... MOrgan freeman showing his Class as Always .... with exceptional camera work of close cell scenes ..... Best Location & Escaping route ..... Credit to sound producer as well as casting directors for amazing supportive cast not even making minor mistakes .... Good thing not showing extreme make ups as it was less action & more drama type .... I Personally love it because it was released on my birthday exactly ON birthday ...... heads off to director & producer for coming up with the best team for best movie.	9
 Truly authentic uplifting movie		10
 Quotes	WARDEN NORTON: I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible. Here you'll receive both. Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me. Welcome to Shawshank.RED: I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start.ANDY: I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.WARDEN NORTON: Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind!RED: Same old sh*t, different day.CAPTAIN HADLEY: What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?BROOKS: Easy peasy japanesey.RED: I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.ANDY: Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.ANDY: You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? RED: No. ANDY: They say it has no memory. That's where I want to live the rest of my life. A warm place with no memory.RED: I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope.	9
 Timeless Film	This film has it's own character, out of any time and place. If you know anything about Justice or Prison, then you can easily see the reality portrayed. The storyline is perfect, with deep layers of emotions. Watching it many times, I see why the younger generation wants to see this picture. So many of the films with Law and Order(no pun intended), are not real. Being more of a period piece, this is a teaching tool on how to do those projects. The convictions alone of the actors, is so refreshing, very few films have this involved with the Director. Will watch it again and again, some of my favorite Actors also...	10
 Best movie of the world Guys Don't Loose Hope It is the best thing u have no body take it from u		10
 The best ever	Perhaps Not to the liking of some of this great achievement, this achievement deserves to be the best ever in each side of this film is fun cannot find a description of the film may be the amounts in the Praise but for the sake of this film is one of the greatest achievements of the cinema.The total of the scenes that make you a shock of the genius of the output and montage of the crew of the entire technical creativity does not ultra in this work is difficult to compare between him and any other movie I see that deserves to be ranked as it is.The role played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as if the fact and not the representation of the wonder of creative mind delicious j they have done in this film either by the end of others never commission that may be the best in the history of art is indeed one of the greatest ends that could be seen a follower.	10
 Probably the best movie of all time		10
 Stephen King's adapted novella, the Shawshank Redemption is a film you gotta see because it is simply a MASTERPIECE!!		10
 Love dis flic	I am not a HUGE Stephen King fan. I'm just not into the scary stuff. But this film is absolutely AMAZING. Over the years I have watched this film numerous times and it just never gets old. I can't begin to imagine what an inmate that has spent the majority of their life behind bars goes through after being released into the world once again. The trials and tribulations have to b huge. This film helps the rest of the world to understand what they go thru. AND I LOVE how Tim Robins gets the cash at the end and Morgan Freeman shows up. Just outstanding. I'm sure. This is one of the films that has helped to push me to be an actor. I just hope I can be half as talented as ALL talent in this film.	10
 Greatest movie since The Seventh Seal	Best movie ever.Tim Robbins acting is exquisite and Morgan Freeman's narrating is mesmerizing.How Stephen King can create such a story is beyond me.I love how you almost feel like a part of the prison family Andy and Red has and how you get to follow them. You also get to understand how an ex-con tries to adopt to a life on the outside after spending their whole life behind bars.What I disliked with the movie was that I felt a particular plot point was thrown together in haste but after that the movie resumes to it's 10/10 stars standard.	10
 Fantastic and brilliant	This movie is just amazing. Star cast, superb photography, brilliant achievement, and a spectacular argument. It's one of those movies that make only far away, and never forget. I've seen him several times and I miss him a lot of people. How can a man so apparently weak and without energy and character, have survived so many years to dream, never giving up on a dream, having endured so many hardships, a battering, raped, etc. And yet he gave hope to his jail mates, let alone its true friends. And the end .. could take revenge on everyone, especially the chain director. Conclusion is an excellent film in every respect, should never be overlooked nor see, ever.	9
 So Inspirational it has Saved Lives		10
 Red Dead Redemption	At a port town, a crowd of passengers disembarks from a steamboat; among them, a grizzled cowboy with a gun at his hip. Two lawmen escort him out.Newsie: Extra, extra, health benefits of smoking! Extra, extra, read allabout...hey! Watch it, mister!The cop had shoved him aside.Newsie: Extra, extra! Bill Williamson's gang...They walk out of range, ending up at Blackwater Station. The cowboy gets on the train without speaking a word, and takes a seat as the steam engine leaves town. Two ladies behind him, and a young lady and a preacher in front of him, hold their own conversations.Lady: Well, I for one am grateful, Mrs. Bush, that they are finally bringingcivilization to this savage land.Mrs. Bush: I could not agree with you more, my dear. My daddy settled thisland and I know he'll be looking down on us, pleased at how wehelped the natives.Lady: Yes they've lost their land, but they've gained access to heaven.John listens to the young lady and the preacher in the seat ahead of him.Jenny: But Father, do you mean unless an innocent receives communion, they'redestined to go to hell? That hardly seems fair.Father: What I mean to say, Jenny, is that there is a great deal of differencebetween an innocent and a savage.Jenny: I never thought of it that way.Lady: Yes they live like animals. But they're happier now.Jenny: Not only do people now have motorcars, father, but I heard pretty soonwe will be able to fly.Father: No, angels can fly, Jenny.Jenny: No, no, apparently people can fly. Didn't you hear? Out in Kansas a maneven got a car to fly.	10
 A master piece abbreviated by a movie	There's no movie based on a fictional novel could embrace perfection like this movie.Hawking had to be proud.Tim Robbins has proved that his dramatized talent is extremely rare.While Morgan talent has been essential movie after movie i can't find a role for freeman in one hand with the existence of the philosophical dimension on the other hand.The movie in general spreads how the bureaucratic employers are working when it comes to save a life and then how would they react when they have to make a choice between their benefits and others life.Dufresne defiantly reflects the justice face and while the warden reflect the true face of opportunism,Stephen King couldn't imagine there's an actor can wear Dufresne so perfectly as Tim.	10
 One of the best movie i seen...	This is a really good story and i like this movie so much!)Its so emotional and so pretty,i have never seen such an amazing movie.I watch it and i couldn't speak... A brilliant movie that is not too short, not too long. It's worth every minute watching.This is a magic story of Stephen King and director Frank Darabont, and i truly thanks for this masterpiece to this greatest peopleIt is the best movie of the 90's, and one of my favorite, so if you haven't seen this movie go watch it, you will not be disappointed, because this movie i will revise for so many times...	10
 The Best of all	Absolutely the best film i have ever seen, nothing compares to the cinematography, the acting and the story itself. it's a great piece of art that will live on forever and be a part of cinema history for many more years. I can remember the first time i ever saw this movie, my now late mother showed it to me and told me that it was a really good movie.(this is when it came on HBO i think) i couldn't believe my eyes even at the age of 11 i was already into the best of movies, and when i watched the story unfold in front of me and witnessed the pure cinematography of it. It immediately became my favorite film of all time. And to this day, 17 years later i am a filmmaker myself and someday strive to make a movie half as good as the shawshank redemption.	10
 excellent movie		10
 You must to see this film	A story of friendship and endurance set in the reality of prison life, The Shawshank Redemption is best known as an Oscar-nominated film. However, this theatre production is based instead on the original novella written by Stephen King relatively early in his career.The direction in this piece is stylised, with a deliberate slow rhythm and pace, particularly in the first act, greatly reducing any sense of menace that you would expect from this so-called tough prison. It is almost Brechtian in style. This becomes frustrating as it takes much of the emotion out of the production; a vital piece of the human connection that then means the audience is less invested in the outcome of the possibly innocent Andy Dufresne and the lovable rouge Red. This underplaying of emotion results in a restrained and difficult to engage with character in Dufresne, played by Ian Kelsey. There are moments of anguish from Kelsey, but with the direction holding such a tight reign on the characters, the moments are too far and between. Patrick Robinson's Red fares a little better as he addresses the audience with a charming older storytelling voice, but is still not given enough freedom to truly embrace Red's charisma. When using this deliberate stylised direction, the impact on the reality of the stage fighting also showed, again detracting from the idea of brutality.The second half picks up the pace slightly and the play overall is watchable with good performances all round from the cast. However, without the rawness derived from emotional context, the prison life never feels as if it is unbearable to be in or watch, meaning the power of the ending is lessened.By Isabella Fraser	10
 One of the top movies of all time!	First of all, the actors chosen to play the key roles were absolutely suitable and fitted each other. More specifically, Morgan Freeman is remarkable. In addition, the direction of the movie was flawless. Excellent Photography! Furthermore, the music was stunning. Wonderful sounds to accompany this epic film. Concerning the story, it was really touching. From the beginning of the film, you get stuck in front of the screen to watch every single scene. You travel in a world of anxiety, pain and ultimate redemption. I love this film so much because of the perfect combination of all the fundamental elements. It is almost certain that you will get emotionally attached with all the characters. To sum up, The Shawshank Redemption is a movie you should watch. It is totally a piece of art.	
 Simply marvelous entertainment.	The Shawshank Redemption is a well-crafted prison drama and another great movie to add to Frank Darabont's impressive filmography. Morgan Freeman is the standout as one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, while Tim Robbins and a host of excellent character actors fill out an outstanding ensemble cast that make you feel like you are there with them in that prison. This is an emotionally satisfying film with many memorable character moments sprinkled into an otherwise pretty standard plot. While I find it to be a little too sensitive at times, this is an excellent motion picture and a must see. It may deserve to be generally regarded as (one of) the most overrated film(s) ever made, but it is above all a wonderful, uplifting and deeply touching tale of hope and perseverance that certainly deserves to be remembered as one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King story.	10
 Tim Robbins	"One of Tim's best performances. He deserved all awards & nominations for this film. Definitely one of the best films I've ever seen. The best part of the movie is the whole thing. Although some parts of the movie were a bit violent, it was done with taste and I felt it was important to the story as a whole. Although the film was rather long, it still was able to hold my attention... I was never in a state of mind where I was wondering ""When is this movie going to end"", and that is very rare with me. I cannot believe I went so many years without seeing this film. It is very much a must-see film. It is great to view for ages 12 and up. This movie has such great story-telling, and uses great dialog, unlike anything you'll ever see in other films. Very well-done to the directors, crew, and especially the cast members. Outstanding."	
 Possibly the best movie that will ever be made.	Cinematography just isn't what it used to be. This movie is not only my personal favorite but also the favorite of the approximate 1.5 million people who have rated this title. The way that this film is made cannot be rivaled by today's standards. The writing, the acting, the scenery, etc combine to make this possibly the best movie that will ever be made. I don't think that this will ever be matched.I have seen Shawshank about 100 times, this is no joke. Every time I watch it I feel the same way that I did when I watched it for the first time. It will never get old. Every time I watch this I begin to sympathize with Andy and enjoy watching his friendship with Red grow. I am in complete awe until the closing credits begin to roll.I sincerely believe that no one can match the power of the Shawshank Redemption.	10

 one of the best movies	It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	10
 Wowsers	I couldn't have asked for a more direct movie. I am so glad this movie was made. Thanks so much for making it. From what i was told bout prison from my friend he told me that this movie was a dead ringer. It makes me never want to go to prison. After seeing this movie i cried my eyes out for about a good 24 hrs.. Yes i know that makes me a cry baby, but i don't care. This movie is definitely a tear jerker. Thanks again. This movie has everything about a day to day life in a prison from sun up to bed time. Remember that prison isn't a laughing matter.This movie has showed me what a crap hole prison can be.	10
 Just watch it !!!	"This movie is so good that words can't possibly be enough to explain its awesomeness. It starts out on a pretty dark note with killings and crime but as the story progresses we see how crime or rather criminals is not always simply black or white, its layers of Grey one cannot objectively see but only feel. We see how the lead character Andy Dufresne grows as a human, accompanied by Morgan Freeman or as people call him "" Red "", his voice sounds like liquid gold. Over the movie you will feel many things, happy would be one of them but wait for that moment because when you finally reach the point where Morgan Freeman is telling you about the Blue of the Pacific and the camera pans out to the ocean, it will be all worth it in the end."	10
 I was reading Stephen King when other kids were reading Judy Blume & Laurence Yep, etc..		10
 Excellent Movie		10
 Striking cinematography and beautifully scripted		10
 It's really worthy of number one position.	"This is my first review here, and i'm glad it's about Shawshank Redemption. What I really loved about this movie is how a man with sheer determination can accomplish even far-fetched goals. It also shows how to pick ourselves up when we are at our lowest. The movie also highlights friendship.I think Red's friendship with Andy is the very thing that kept Red from ending up like Brooke. I really loved the part when Red said ""I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him"". Overall, it really is a masterpiece and deserves the top position."	10
 love	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	10
 Better than the book	This is one of the few films that I found to be an improvement over the original story. There were a couple spots in the novella that were a little weak. Don't get me wrong, the story is great, but the film made some improvements, and in doing so, made a better story. I will add a note about Stand by me, another adaptation of a S. Kings novella. This time, the story took the city of Portland Maine and made it Portland Oregon; a brilliant move. The stories told within the story were removed except for a few short snippets. The pie eating contest was important, but many of the other stories told within the original novella were a little too strange and took away some of the vigor of the story for me. Two great stories, made into two greater films.	9
 Great Movie but there is a doubt about an incident	This is a great movie, and I watched it many times -- with every time I watch it , my love and understanding of the movie grows.One of the best movies involving jail terms.Not only have a strong story line, but also backed up by great direction and very strong acting.The voice of Morgan Freeman is a catalyst.There is one part for which I did not get an explanation from the movie -- why did the warden kill Tommy Williams? Of course, Tommy Williams could prove that Andy was innocent, but what benefit would the warden get by stopping him? I did not find any reason for that act.	10
 Amazing actors, story and direction - a superb film	This film is on e of the ultimate experience for viewers that watch movies because they wish to be transported into another place and time. I promise that once the story starts you will be swept away against your will and returned beyond your imagination. Literally and experience that will make you cry with joy. This is superb film from start to finish with outstanding acting, direction and storytelling. I cannot imagine a finer art work on the subjects covered in this indelible story that transcends all generations and walks of life. It's more than a film or a movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a pure American Classic and we, the viewing public are much better by being blessed by the opportunity to see it.	10
 I can watch it over and over and over again ...	There's not many movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them. It just feels pitch perfect. Well written, perfectly casted ... the cinematography is flawless. By far, Darabont's crown jewel. Everything just works so well. And Morgan Freeman's (now ubiquitous) narration is the heart and soul of the film. A dark but uplifting tale about hope and friendship. A timeless, Hollywood masterpiece.I sometimes wonder if films like this will ever be made again? Would it even be possible for a movie like this to be greenlit today and compete with Fast & Furious 23? Probably not. If you haven't seen this movie, waste no time, find it and watch it.	10
 The film is a classic.	What a great movie. What journey and what struggle. The film maintains the viewers' interest thought in the middle just for a moment you might get the impression the film is a little too long. It is a classic. The acting is superb. The plot is strong enough to keep you glued to the screen, and the twists and turns make you feel you are watching a real situation from life, with artistic beauty about it. You never know how the movie will end, and then there can a twist yet in the tale that may turn out to be the very essence of the movie. The film is rightly an academic content by now. Apparently, you may feel the film is a little boring due to a prominent and beautiful woman missing, but the fact is the film does not fail in keeping you interested in it until the very end.	10
 WE used this as the top screenplay in script class		10
 A Life Changing Experience	I'm not a professional critic, so I will put it the simplest way I can. This movie is one of those movies you keep coming back to every few years and watch again. It will never get old either.The prison represents life itself, the lives we were born to at least, and it tells us another life is possible out there and for that we must be able to break out of the life we are born to. The film shows the birth, maturation and re-birth of a person who does not belong to the society at large. In the final the man is reborn in mud, filthy just like before, but this time he is going to live the life he chose.	10
 One of the best movies of all time!	This movie is excellent, regarding every aspect! You can't stop watching it 'till its last second! The acting is great, all actors are amazing, the story is kind of genius, very well-conducted, specially for a long movie as this one! And of course, it was written by Stephen King, one of my favorite authors. In fact, I think this movie gets the #1 place in all book adaptations from him! Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins matched perfectly, two amazing artists. Every detail of this movie grabs your attention without you even notice! The first time I saw this movie (maybe 2 years ago), I started watching knowing that it was elected as the #1 movie of all time, here in IMDb, but even though I was not expecting too much, I'm now a huge fan of it! I totally recommend, worthy watching! ;)	10
 Strong movie that leaves an impact for years to come.		8
 Very Chill	That movie was pretty chill. I loved the story and the shots were amazing. The lighting on the dudes face was beautiful. I also likd the screenplay. If there is any movie out there, I would choose to show my kids this one. The death at the end was very intense. I cried at the part with the dragon. If there is ever a time when u see a dragon, Take a pic and share it and run away. Shawshank should have won awards. If I love this movie, I am cool I want to meet the director.y movie out there, I would choose to show my kids this one. The death at the end was very intense. I cried at the part with the dragon. If there is ever a timey movie out there, I would choose to show my kids this one. The death at the end was very intense. I cried at the part with the dragon. If there is ever a time	9
 If you read this, and you haven't watched it yet... what are you waiting for!?	No wonder this movie is currently highest ranked on IMDb. It has a fantastic story line, great actors, and it triggers all of the emotions. It is also one of those movies that will(should) never get a forced sequel because it is fine as it is. I guess a well-made TV remake wouldn't be bad, but I think this type of plot has been covered enough.The other day I was with a group of friends and we were discussing several great movies. I was surprised to find out that there are still millennials who have not seen this! If you haven't seen it yet, make a plan and go watch it. You will not be disappointed.	9
 About The Shawshank Redemption	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	10
 Amazing. Well scripted. An Iconic film	A must watch. This film really hits home. It's amazing so much can be fit into such a short film. Hanks is amazing. Delivering an amazing performance that does not disappoint. No matter how many times I watch this it has the same affect. I would not recommend for young children. A real hit. Will always be remembered. A movie you can watch 1000 times. If you enjoy this movie you will also enjoy castaway as well as many other movies that Hanks is in. It is a shame that some of the cast of actors has passed away. I hope you will enjoy this film as much as I did and it will make a positive impact on your life. There are few great films and this happens to be one.	
 Written to hit your sad notes...	A little anal rape and before you know it, you've made a martyr of a man. Good martyr though, except that he stays alive through out the entire movie. Well told in classic Morgan Freeman style but Shawshank redemption, whilst being a very fine example of Cinema, is lacking in much. It is very tense and dramatic but simple in it's premise, innocent man will escape from jail. In between are an abundance of clichées and well used jail house scenarios, as seen in many other lock up romps. The difference with Shawshank is how polished everything is. It's not a surprise when Frank Darabont is behind a helm. He has proved to cast well and have perfect characters execute a story to the most professional of levels. I think that the movie would have been better if they had been following Red and Andy get's busted when Red comes meets him in the sandy finale. Maybe executed by FBI and Red was involved in the sting operation. you may not agree.	8
 The movie is so perfect		10
 Timeless	Whenever this movie comes on I have to watch it and I love it every time. This movie is not a depressing movie overall and even though there are sad moments in the movie; there is also has a lot of humor about life as well. The warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red is what make this movie so great. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. The redemption and friendship theme of this movie is what makes it easy for us all to easily identify with these characters and evoke such emotions while we watch for the first time or the 20th + times you see it Like myself.	10
 Best Movie of all times	This 1994 classic is my favorite movie of all times. surprised it was not picked for any major Oscars. The acting from Tim Robins is superb as well as Morgan Freeman's acting and narrating. The supporting cast are all above average in their performance, though nothing to hail in any large degree. The story has a clear flow through out the movie. The Hero (Tim Robins)has to overcome his demons from the start. His end goal is to be in peace with himself. to sum the movie up its a some what a count of Monte Kristo story. instead of getting out to get revenge, the hero accepts his destinations and battles his inner-demons.	10
 The Greatest Story Ever Told	You get busy living or you get busy dying. The phrase that came out of Andy Defruense mouth were legendary. I read the book a year ago in my high school and it compared nothing to the movie. The few times in this life the movie was better than the book. There wasn't much of a cinematic feel, no artsy angles or vibrant colors. It was an analogy to a man trapped inside of an inartistic world set free by prison. Again, it is not artsy but it is one of the greatest stories ever told. The first time viewing this movie, i believed it to drag on, but i watched it again and again, loving it more and more every time. It is a surprise it never got an Oscar.	10

 Awesome	One of the best movies I have ever seen. I love Stephen King, and I am always excited to see one of his books turned into a movie. Shawshank Redemption is an classic, a movie that everyone should watch. I loved the chemistry between the two main actors. For people who have not read the book (but also for the book lovers) the movie will be an exciting experience till the last scene.Even now, after more than 20 years, modern movies cannot be compared to this one. Morgan Freeman is as always excellent. U get an mix of emotions watching Shawshank redemption. You feel sad, happy, compassionate, all at the same time for prisoners... Brooks as a character and his story-line broke my heart and i still feel the sadness for this character.	10
 Great	In this fantastic movie people who was innocent figure out himself to be free man.And people who can't afford to live without friends and strong enough to be fixed with world.The man who tried to get back his life.The only word for this movie was powerful.Prisoners were need to get help from us .To survive in the wild world you have to strong.Morgan Freeman has excellent skills.Director was the best of times over the years.However it was deserved to win Oscar.The people who made this movie were be memorial.This will make your mind to think about life and people who are fighting for their lives.Great thanks for letting me to be watched this movie.Good for us to take the time of feeling.	10
 A Cult Classic		10
 A fantastic movie	"This is by far the best prison movie ever. The movie has everything a movie in this genre needs and it all blends together perfectly, a bit like the industry decided to release a ""best of"" record and this was the result. One of the movies greatest strength is it's balance; it doesn't deny the miserable conditions inside a prison while not taking advantage of it, and despite the sorrow it is nothing but a feel good movie.Tim Robbins as well as Morgon Freeman are doing an excellent job portraying their characters and the prison environment is displayed with excellence. It is easy placing your self in that prison and it routines.Despite my love for the movie I can't say I agree with it's #1 ranking on IMDb, but it most simply be due to the fact that people can't find anything they dislike about it."	9
 Rating	Great movie!I remember watching it as a kid and not really understanding the concept and angle that the directors and crew were trying to make. I watched it again in high school a few years ago (More like 8) and totally got the concept! My top 5 favorite movie of all time. I think I might actually go watch it again now before my huge audition tomorrow. I can't think of anything that I can compare this movie to. Its gained its own identity with me and I think anyone who hears the title would understand exactly what I was talking about seeing as though its one of the top movies of all time. If there could be a second make to the movie I would love to be a part of it! Hopefully kids today would take the time to watching such a great movie and understand what it means to be an actor! These guys put this together well.	9
 Perfect!	That deep film, virtually perfect on the technical side, all the scenes were happening naturally and organized, and has a great emotional appeal in several scenes. This film brings some important points that deserve to be discussed, such as the case of a person unable to reintegrate in society, and it is with a sense of anguish and ends up taking drastic decisions, very interesting this point. I think the guys in the comments exaggerated a little, just say no so I took the film because I killed the end, the film gave some tips pro outcome still is a very good movie. The biggest story of this film is the friendship. A work for eternity, that for sure will always be marked in my heart dreaming of the day that true justice is done always without mistakes, without corruption, Norton's.	
 Excellent film.	An amazing story, great cast and incredible acting. I saw this film for the first time this year, and have seen it twice more since.An incredible story, told extraordinarily well. Gripping, exciting and satisfying.What more is there to add? This film isn't top of the list of the highest rated movies on IMDb for nothing!If you haven't seen this movie, make it top of your list. If you have already seen it, it's probably about time you saw it again anyway, right?10/10	10
" Simply ""The Best"""	"This movie has everything in it hope, betrayal, fear you name it. I've seen many movies over the years, many excellent films. However, every time I see a movie I compare every movie with this one and consider it whether its a great movie or a flop one so ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is my metric to measure every other movie. The message this movie gives is so strong that it will change the way you make your decisions why if you are wondering ? then its because every moment of this movie will inspire you to believe in HOPE. The tagline of this movie fits perfectly ""FEAR can hold you prisoner. HOPE can set you free."". So if you are still deciding whether to watch this movie or not don't WAIT!!! go get this movie and watch it immediately its one of those movies that you watch it before you DIE"	10
 Nobody believed him, all hope lost but in confinement he finds friendship and a way out	Great movie and highly recommended for anyone seeking a Monte Cristo type story. Set up for murder. Sent to prison for life. Agony and loneliness is evident. Found life thru knowledge for education. Friends and loyalties were made. Hope came and was squashed. That leads to anger and action. Friends worry without knowledge of future of protagonist. Hope is obtained for more than just the protagonist. Great for people whom like; biographies, emotional, male bonding, facing obstacles, seeking hope of the future, prison life, life building skills, justice prevailing, getting even with those whom treat people horribly, creating something good in a bad situation.	9
 Good Film	"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods. But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time."	10
 Real masterpiece	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10

 Great movies, Must watch.	Loved this movie! Great story, amazing and remediable characters. The Plot keeps you guessing, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time I watch it!Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give performances that will knock your socks off! There on screen friendship makes me weep for something as close and meaningful in everyday life. This is a movie to watch on a rainy day, with a big bucket of pop corn and a cold soda. As time goes on this movie will stand the test of time, it will be considered a classic, up their with greats like Brian's song, or the lethal weapons franchise.	9
 Terrific Film Based on a short story by...		9
 A Very Good Movie To Watch	A Very Good Movie To Watch............. I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Finally Hope is key to being Alive.............	9
 A must watch for every film lover	The story of a one common man caught in circumstances creates an atmosphere which makes a viewer on the edge of seat. Stellar direction and acting. Morgan Freeman is a great performer who has shown the way a human being can excel in his endeavor. The film is an all time excellence in all departments of Film Making be it Editing, Sound, Direction, Production Values, Art Design, Sets & Costumes. The story line is the crux of the film where it takes a 180 degree turn and we see something which is beyond our expectation. The casting of this film along with top line & bottom line artists is well planned. The background music score is excellent. Out of the top 100 films I rate this as the best.	9

 Awesome		10
 One of top five best movies I have ever seen!	What else to write about The Shawshank Redemption that haven't been written before? I usually like action movies and comedies and this movie has no comedy and no action. The movie was filmed by Stephen Kings novel so it has to be great. The story is set in 1947y Portland, Maine where a banker is is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences for murdering his wife and her lover. He will meet all sort of characters in side the prison good and bad, from inmates with good hart to sadistic prison guards. It is not a strange that The Shawshank Redemption is number one on the IMDb's top 250 list because there is no other place for this movie. I highly recommend seeing this great movie to everyone who haven't yet watched it.	10
 Triumph of the human spirit		10
 Very intense movie	Whenever I see a movie that takes place in prison I feel sorry for the characters, as they must go through difficult and dramatic situations. But rarely I seen in this kind of movie the instinct of freedom, that grabs the viewer and holds it to the expectation of how the story will end. Although there are difficult situations, there is also good ones who manage to balance coexistence, and makes the film not be so dramatic. I think that for a film to succeed, the principal actors must have good chemistry to demonstrate the talents in their performances, and the chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is unsurpassed.It's a great film, well directed and the performances are flawless.	8
 Absolute Classic	I had this movie in my laptop for 3 years and I didn't watched...One day I found it in IMDb at the top..so decided to watch..and it made me watch more than 20 times...No doubt why it remains at the top...It gave every elements for a great movie...and what can I say about the twists in the movie...that moment when he escaped from the jail..it takes the film to another level beyond imagination...it gave the film the right pace...how can we forget Morgan Freeman...realistic actor...its a must watch movie before you die...Exceptional movie..brilliant direction..extra ordinary casting...superb script...and what else it need..! Definitely a pure Classic in all terms...!!	10
 great film	this is my 2nd film review and i hope i do better. this is a great film i own this movie and its in my top 30 having Morgan Freeman in the movie is the best i love his movies and that's one reason i love this film. the film is so good my friends watches this movie over and over again. its so great. it gets annoying though but they like it and so do i. Morgan Freeman is a great actor and i respect him and in in this movie he played the friend of an odd man a great man. what can i say about this movie i love the movie as i wrote and the characters are great and so are the actors.and that is about it i cant say anything else. apart from why i gave it an 8 is because i think it could have been greater.	8
 One of the best films ever!	"Having watched it too many times, I still find myself thrilled and touched by it. I do not see it as a film ""made in prison"" but more like ""in life"". It is the strength underneath that makes you what you are. Sometimes it needs more than a good director, a writer or an effective cast to create a masterpiece. ""The Shawshank Redemption"", for me, has it all! ... First Morgan Freeman and then Tim Robbins, push us towards a world made of realism, darkness, acceptance and redemption, and finally victory over those who believe that power over other people makes them powerful... such a joke indeed. I really believe that one must watch this film at least one time. There will be much to learn."	10
 Amazing Film	I've seen this with my grandparents countless times (mostly because when it's on TV, they don't even budge to change the channel, which I never minded) & even to this day, I still enjoy it. It's not THE GREATEST FILM I EVER SEEN/SAW but it's so good and every time I watch it, I still cry. It's this film and The Green Mile that enjoyMorgan Freeman aka God Tim Robbins aka Susan Sarandon's ex bar give great, fantastic performances.Sorry this review is short or unworthy to be read, but I can't really explain my review without gushing over it, but I recommend it to anyone willing to watch	8
 great movie....must watch ...atleast onetime in life	"its a movie on prison break. we all seen the season prison break. it has 3 seasons. but, this movie has only 2 hrs. classic movie. i rated 10/10. i also like escape plan which is also on prison break. but this movie is different. i like this movie very much. director feel us hero was not guilty so he comes out from prison...and live his life happily...with his friend in prison.... i listed this movie in must seen movies before you die...see my list....""MUST SEEN MOVIES BY MANDLI""and......also...a note.. i write this review this long and long because review says ""your review does not contain enough lines -the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text"	10
 Forever a classic.	This movie in my opinion is a much watch for anybody who enjoys films, it has to be appreciated by all. it has everything you need in a film, it has drama, great actors, the budget, the story and Morgan Freeman!. i have seen this film multiple times and always recommend it to anyone who cares to ask for my opinion on films i enjoy. Just writing about this film is already making me want to watch it again. I hope you all do the same. Because it really is a good watch. There is also really good humour. Also there is no reason for me to put any spoilers in this other then that i can't believe how much they make you write just to be able to submit a review, i mean not like there isn't enough in the movie to do it just that i don't think it should be this amount.	
 Bravo!		9
 Rita Haworth Poster	One of my early experiences with a non supernatural Stephen King movie/Short Story. A Great prison movie with a full ensemble top line cast and every character had something. With each point of the film was waiting to see who was going to be around until the end. It was a departure to see a King story without beasts or ghosts in it. And how a lot of the characters were developed throughout the film.And the last moments of the film which I will need to see again, to check things out for myself and to speculate if I missed those details myself.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption Review	Hands Down The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen... Shocked By The Ending.... Deserves 10/10 First I Thought The Movie Was Not That Good As Its A Flop Movie, But When I Watched It I Honestly Gotta say The best movie made till now. Their are certain moments when u get bored but the ending totally changes the way u thinking. Morgan Freeman is at its best. Tim Robbins is the master of the movie And no word for the warden he is too good Truly a masterpiece. Amazing movie, one of my three favorites! I could watch it 100 times and it would never get old. Though there is a couple of scenes with violence and sexual dialogue. Language throughout.	10

 great movie		9
 Touch people's hearts, profound impact	20 years ago in college, the students dropped out due to encounter, depressed, so watch the movie together, the film Andy's experience, giving not give up, and give courage, the moment there is a way to face everything is every 20 years, whenever difficulties, think of Andy, and the courage to face the deep impact of the film, no wonder it can be used as the first 100 big movie !! In any case, people who have not seen the movie, is a loss, almost every year to re-read once, often have a harvest.Whether the movie is a great story, and the music class, acting class, almost can not find a picky.The movie can be said is a classic classic inside, almost never heard of people do not like this movie.	10
 Excellent Movie	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.	10

 Remember, Red, hope is a good thing. Maybe the best of things		9
 best	great direction, excellent acting, soothing cinematography, thrilling story and hopeful ending. true meaning of running out word i understood after watching this brilliant classic movie. No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success.Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10	10

 Simply Perfect		10
 Simply Perfect	"Shawshank has everything you need from a movie.Cinematography and direction, both combine to make the film something unique.This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.Freeman, a wonderful actor, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his perfect playing.I read elsewhere this ""if you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption"". Well I do agree completely.I never, ever, ever heard from a friend of mine who I recommended it that he had not liked it."	10
 The movie	"I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.Movie-making seems to be like golf; for a truly excellent game, ALL the elements must come together. Everyone involved must have perfect ""form"". Director, Darabont, must have been at the top of his game when he put this gem together. Of course the actors were excellent; Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins seldom disappoint. The thing that makes this movie exceptional is that Darabont coaxed the best performances out of the supporting actors also. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown were utterly believable (and bad guys don't come much worse than them).The other essential ingredient for a successful movie is simple: It must have a well thought out plot with a perfect beginning, middle and end. So many movies fall over by getting at least one of these aspects wrong. Not so with Shawshank Redemption. Just like Goldilocks said, ""This is just right!"" Buy this one for your home collection because you'll definitely want to see it again"	9
 Top 5	"One of my all time favorite movies. Although there's not much action, the plot and acting pulled me in. Throughout the movie the suspense keeps building and building with everything happening to Andy you just feel bad for him. It all leads up to him escapping which he rightfully deserves to.Clearly Tim Robins was devoted to his role as Andy Dufresne. The way he stays in the same exact character through the whole movie is impressive. He always has a mild composure with little outbursts of anger and rage which I think he uses perfectly. Morgan Freeman as ""Red"" was impressive as always. Taking almost the mentor role for Andy to help him get through being in a jail until finally escapping."	10
 Great movie	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite being a box office disappointment, the film received multiple award nominations (including seven Oscar nominations) and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu- ray. It was included in the American Film Institute's 100 Years...100 Movies 10th Anniversary Edition.[3] It is now widely considered one of the best films of all time."	10
 most powerful & awesome story	this movie is make guidelines to anyone to live this life in hope that make you powerful and enthusiastic to make something for yourself and who u live with ..... in brief awesome movie what makes u watch it over and over again..! the prison is school of life but this movie makes u love the person who was in prison because he know the meaning of freedom and appreciate it however not all in prison are guilty but is the circumstance and destiny what we should accept and get the useful learn from it great decoration ... great actors.... great shot.... and finally great direction if there is perfection in movie ... then i will call that one perfect... thanks Morgan Freeman and Tim Robinson For that master piece.	10
 Excelente	I found it amazing and unique film , is the perfect movie and I do another movie exceeded, the performances are great as are the actors and producers which can be noticed that gave freedom to the director to make the film as wanted why you can really see how the director planted his idea in the movie and you can also notice the effort that used on stage and in the locker room that gave a kind of reality to the film which caused the people who saw they feel identified with the story and characters. The actors act in the best possible way which gives it a unique and memorable touch to the film and its characters which always carry in our memory for its history in jail and obstacles by crossing the characters.	10
 Summary: The Shawshank Redemption (1994)		10
 There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	10
 Life in a prison, Andy's way....	"Undoubtedly, Shawshank Redemption is the greatest prison drama ever made. Andy's life is turned upside-down when he is convicted of killing his wife and send to the prison. He has to fight all the evils of the society he was never trained for. He makes friends with Ellis Redding and his bumpy journey in prison continues.Very few movies have the great combination of story, music and casting; SR hits highs on all notes. Morgan Freeman gave his best performance as Ellis Redding and his narration is one of the many reasons why this movies is considered among the greatest.Favourite Quote : ""... and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."""	10

Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself.

 awesome movie	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair. The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself.

 Best Movie Ever	Though I have seen many movies related to prison break or prison escape but this movie has broken all records of how sophisticatedly a prisoner can escape from a heavily guarded prison without anyone noticing. Dufrene was innocent in his wife's brutal murder. But somehow his innocence was unnoticed in the court and was found guilty and faced back to back life sentences. Also the narrator and backbone of the movie was Morgan Freeman. His unexceptional narration made the movie even more fantastic. Overall, I just want to conclude that if this were to release again, it would have broken all records and won many Oscars again.	10
 review may contain spoilers	"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	10
 Simply the best	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship.I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving.His portrayal is one of the most saddest and realistic in any movie period. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. It will truly be a unique experience."	10
 great adaptation from book	as a die-hard king fan for 30 years, i have routinely been disappointed in the movies based on his books. this is quite possibly the best movie adaptation i've seen. overall, i was impressed with the performances of all the characters. maybe the only thing i wasn't clear about or didn't understand was the fact that some of the guards had accents that didn't seem to be louisianian. the accents seemed to be more boston-ish. however, it has been a while since i've read the books so maybe i'm forgetting a detail or two.ultimately, i recommend this movie to any stephen king fan, and to anyone in general! it's excellent!!	10
 Best	"This movie is the best movie ever for me ! He deserve the first place ! Story : ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" -This short story said everything about this movie, i liked all the personality, specially the hero of the movie. The Director Frank Darabont he had know how to play with all the personalities and their roles. So great thank to him because he make a great movie. For the stars, ""Tim Robbins"" he's my best actor all time ! 14 October 1994 is a special day, so always remember it ! :D I liked everything about the movie, even the Soundtracks. I think in our day we missed the movies such as The Shawshank Redemption :("	9
 Not the Best and Not the Worst - But Still Pretty Good	"A movie worthy of the label, 'very good' – but being number one out of all movies ever? No way, are you kidding me? One should go back to snacking on those wacky mushrooms – please. Better yet let us all have some, those hallucinations need to be shared by one and all. It was a good movie...very good in fact. And without question, this is some quality entertainment. I really did enjoy the one time I saw it. I have to say though, I did not wet myself with glee when I watched the flick. It just seemed like the plot was far-fetched and a bit tiresome. The premise of good triumphing over evil is outstanding. It is too bad that the action of defining good and evil is clearly sitting outside the reality-room in 'Redemption.' 'Spoiler Alert' 'Spoiler Alert' Prison guards = bad and hardened criminals = bad? Why? I can understand Tim Robbins latching his wagon to this ridiculous notion – but Morgan Freeman? Sorry it just doesn't compute. For me – a very good movie – but not a great movie. I will give this ""King"" drama an 8/10"	8
 Movie	"The Shawshank Redemption garnered widespread critical acclaim from critics and has a ""certified fresh"" score of 91% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 64 reviews with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10. The critical consensus states ""The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances."" [19] The film also has a score of 80 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 19 critics indicating ""generally favorable reviews'.[20] It is currently rated an average of 9.3[21] out of 10 on IMDb by almost 1.4 million voters making it the highest rated movie on the website. The film has been critically acclaimed for depicting Jean-Paul Sartre's ideas about existentialism more fully than any other contemporary movie"	10
 The best movie	This is the best movie I have ever seen. There are so many lessons in this movie. Somehow, all of those lessons are really necessary for life. At least, I think so and I need them for my life. My habit is to read quotes from movies. And from Shawshank Redemption, there are the most quotes that I like. The movie has no special action or no high-tech scene. However, it just smoothly flow. And also, it just slowly makes me feel. Well, I think it worth for 10 point. Actually, I am really lazy to type such kind of long preview like that. My sentences are not good. My English is not good too. But I still try to write this review because I like this movie very much.	10
 Film The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Great Movie...	This movie I'm not going to call this film the IMDb #1 movie, but I really can't deny that this is fantastic. The cast, the score, the writing, and the power are all here in this film, and filled with strength. It's one of those movies that you will continue to think about even after the film is over. It is about a friendship, a life, an evil, and a hope. A hope that is considered in many ways to be bridge to insanity inside the prison walls. We see these people as years of time goes by. We see friendships grow, and topics change. It really puts you in the prison, and makes you feel what's like to behind those bars. You feel the friendship, the hope, the darkness, and the pure horror of it all.	10
 A must watch	I am in love with this movie..What an endurance of patience the protagonist had.Its a sheer display of how a person can get what he wants.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.	10
 The movie that opens your mind and gives you hope	This is a movie that truly deserves a 10. It truly opens your conscience an lets you look at life differently in three ways. You realize that your world that you think is OK, is actually like a prison. That's the way that makes this movie depressing.The other way is a bit more positive. It makes you realize that things that you worry about are not actual problems. That happens when you see the people in the movie that have the real problems.The final way is the most positive. This movie gives you hope that someday everything will be better. If you are feeling sad missing somebody, this is definitely the movie you should see.	10

 over all	this is the great and powerful movie , but doesn't mean is #1 for me , each one have #1 movie so don't judge me . for me Godfather 1 is #1 This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.But this is a great movie , over what i said , still The Shawshank Redemption deserves 10 of 10 .	10

 the Redemption	one of the best movie ever i had seen not just a movie the The Shawshank Redemption give to you thing other movies couldn't give it's the hope .. the happy ending and the Justice is make you happy when you see the movie 104 minute from the the best Screenplay i love the actors i can't write more because the movie is Genius enjoy it Not for two hours or more Ahdk Bahaddath and Adjalkk wish that never ends onset see some events boring but soon begin to events and make you excited and eager to see what's next.

Old movie from the seventies but time makes you live events.It is undergoing grief. Emotions. Happiness. That were not have seen the film and do not waste your time reading this report, and go and have him and he saw. Believe me, you'll miss the task in minutes not see Masterpiece Hollywood.. first Review i write ayman alsalman	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	"Andy, who is a young and successful banker, has been sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and lover. This movie revolves around the events in his life from when he comes to prison till he escapes from it. This the one of the best movies I have ever seen. The best message conveyed by this movies is of eternal hope. Andy was sent to the prison though he didn't commit the crime. Over the years, he retains hope and earns the respect of fellow prisoners, especially he bond with a longtime convict, Red. Over the time, Andy finds ways to live out life with relative ease as one can in a prison, leaving a message for all that while the body may be locked away in a cell, the spirit can never be truly imprisoned. And finally he escapes from the prison and frees himself. This movies truly depicts the meaning of the quote ""Hope is a good thing maybe the best thing, and no good things ever dies""."	10
 Very Good Movie	The movie is primarily filmed inside a prison. One great thing I liked about the movie is that it is not shown from the perspective of its hero (Andy Duferene) but it is shown from the perspective of Red(Morgan Freeman). The film starts with a courtroom scene where Andy is given two life sentences as he is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. Then the story goes inside the prison and stays there. We see how Andy is different from others. How he risks his life for getting beer for his friends and things like. Red is the closest person to Andy in person. Andy, by his skills, impresses the prison staff, so they allow him to write letters to government officials for funds for prison library and also they utilize it to run their scams. The movie doesn't seem to show pity over Andy's condition. It purely deals with it in a subjective manner. Andy do many good things in prison, like he helps his prison mates to get a high school diploma.Overall, the movie is worth watching.	10

 A hymn to hope		10
 One of the best movie i have watched!!!	"If you were to take a poll today and ask anyone from Gen X and back what they think of Shawshank Redemption, chances are you'd get an overwhelmingly positive response. The story of a banker convicted of a double homicide, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), maintains his innocence and finds a way of surviving 19 years of harsh prison life, all the while creating an unlikely bond with fellow convict Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start."	10
 Hope will endure	When the odds are against you, there's only moving forward or turning back. When Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sent to one of the toughest prisons for two consecutive life sentences for murders he did not commit, the mere thought is enough to make anyone insane. Prison life is tough, but Shawshank prison gets the cake for displaying just how harsh it can be. Corrupt guards, brash punishments and bare minimum accommodations are only half the picture. Just as soon as he's about to break, he makes a discovery that requires incredibly true determination and hope. The Shawshank Redemption is a screenplay adaptation of Stephen King's novella; Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Writer and Director Frank Darabont was able to capture a realistic representation of what prison life might have looked like in the first half of the 20th century. Although the budget was very modest for this film, it really looks like they didn't need anymore. A cast that consists of veteran actors helps to meld the film's respect with their performances. One very noteworthy performance was from Morgan Freeman's character: Ellis Boyd (Red). He was also the one who narrated most of the film and that's always a treat for the audience.Thomas Newman who was responsible for the soundtrack did a great job enhancing the scenes whether it is eerie or joyous. Although at times I felt that there needed to be a more powerful theme to reflect the scene which fortunately was only in a few scenes. Nevertheless, the captivating themes are something to remember in this film. Memorable characters, a great soundtrack and an excellent plot all make this a highly recommended movie to watch. There really isn't much to nit-pick about this film which is what really brings it to the top. Like all highly rated/regarded films, there tends to be some form of overrating which is understandable, since all great things attract jealousy.	9
 my lover		9
 Get busy living or get busy dying	The fact this movie stands at the IMDb top for years now should be enough to convince you to watch this asap. Based on a novella by Stephen King, Frank Darabont's film is perhaps the most accomplished prison drama ever. If you liked Papillon, you are going to love Shawshank's Redemption. But this is more than just a bleak prison drama. Not that there aren't grim situations depicted here. Several points in the story are not for the faint of heart for their cruelty and outright sense of injustice. The ordeals of one Andy Dufresne (in an unsurpassed performance by Tim Robbins) and his fellow cell mates are in fact so harrowing that will make you beg for justice to be done and pray for salvation. Is there hope and light at the end of the tunnel? Let's say that this movie belongs to that group of films (like Sixth Sense and Jacob's Ladder) that have a little secret and when the time for catharsis comes, after all the trials our hero has been through, it doesn't just rain, it pours. It is that precise moment that turns what would have otherwise been a finely crafted drama into a timeless classic. As the protagonist at one point says, hope is a good thing, perhaps the best of things. And it is hope that fuels this expertly told tale of fight against adversity and why this film resonates so strongly with so many people.	10
 This is a great movie	SR is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It's story is about a man who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sentenced for life in prison . After twenty years of great troubles in the prison he escapes from the prison by much hard working and patience. Then he lives happily ever after overseas. Movies background displays the life in prison, it highlights innocent people in the prison. Even they did bad things they deserves redemption. But not all of them. Some deserve punishment, some deserve freedom. It isn't easy to choose who deserves what. This also shows the corruption in authority. They only care about money. They doesn't care about lives of the inmates. For example the fat guy who cries in his first night gets killed by guards. If the authorities care about lives of inmates they should punish the responsible for it. But they don't even raise a question.	10
 Great	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. Great movie with excellent actors and soundtracks. But I've seen better. Morgan Freeman is a great actor, as good as Tim Robbins. Unfortunately, we won't see second part. The story is very good, sometimes it makes me feel a 30 year old prisoner. I'm loving it! I recommend it for everybody. Thanks IMDb for his great top 250. If there wasn't no IMDb, I wouldn't see the movie."	
 Still Not The Best Movie of All Time		7
 I like!!	"Yet I could not watch the movie , but it seems to me the story pleases me a lot. I'll do with the maximum attention. I hope not disappoint me this production.I was Recommended As such hope and what is in the agreement with the opinion of my colleague. Never had listen talk in "" The Shawshank Redemption of (1994 ) "" but I liked In this prefecture.I am pretty addicted to series and recommend The Vampire Diaries , I found this fabulous series . Watch and not go wrong."	7
 Beautiful, Classical Title	This is a lovely movie and a must watch for all the Classical movie lovers out there. There's pinch of emotions that comes bundled with the movie and you eventually get involved in the movie so much that it's hard for you to decide who is the right man. In short, life is easiest when you learn the right way to live it.The movie comes with quite a lot twists and suspense scenes. At the end it'll be hard for you to believe. Won't reveal much about the movie - but if you're a movie freak and you're the person who is turned on with classical tales, this is the one for you. At the end of the movie I'm pretty sure that you'll have a different perspective towards life and people around you. Do watch it.	9
 A fantastic movie	"Every time this movie in on, I watch it. I don't even check to see what else is on, I just watch this. If I see that it is coming on again in a few hours, I wait for it to come on again. When it isn't on, I'm thinking about watching it. I have a general idea of every line that is in the movie, so I can sort of see what will be said next. Regardless of this, I still continue to watch this movie every time it is on.""No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other."" carflo (another IMDb reviewer) This is the best summary for this movie. The first time I saw this movie was when I was passing by the television. It was on and my mother was watching it. She, like me, has vowed to watch it every time it's on. I didn't know it at the time but it was a long standing tradition that was passed on to me. Thank you to all those cable channels with commercials for airing this movie once a week."	10
 This Excitement of a Journey!	I needed to make a review this goodness movie I've ever seen. The movie was so thrilling all time. The main player and supporting were as suit as it is.When first time I watched this movie, it was a kind of detective movie I've seen a lot of it myself. But, after I watched whole scenes, it took me a kind of excitement and more unpredictable than I thought.For the ending of my review, I would completely recommend this movie for all of you. I feel very exciting for this after finishing this movie This movie is a must watch. True life is about to be told in this movie!! 10/10.	10
 Superb!

 Best ever made	"One of the best movies ever made. Morgan Freeman is like always best playing a role, he is magnificent. In my opinion Tim Robbins makes one of his lifetime roles here as well. As the plot says ""Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency."" but this movie is actually more than that. I do not want to ruin pleasure of watching so enjoy it as much as you can. Also in my opinion this movie was the foundation for other good movies, one of that being Inception that has ""some"" of the Shawshank Redemption ideas inside . In my opinion this can be called the beginning of a new era in cinematography history as it records new (for the time) approaches on movies and acting (see Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) . Also, this movie is one of the new plan to save Hollywood movie industry at the time as Hollywood was almost deep buried in clichés and bad producing and acting movies. Just to shorten it up i am speechless and please watch, enjoy and have a nice experience.Thank you for reading my review , hope i managed to catch you and please stay tuned."	9
 Storyline	Right from the opening credits, this film shows quality. It stands above other comedies due to the lack of filler material - every line is memorable. The cast is great; the two leads make the most of their characters (both as brokers and bums) but never overstep the mark, thanks partly to the tight editing. The plot becomes a little bizarre, but by that time you're already hooked, and the ending of the film is pure joy. To my mind, no recent comedy has been this good; it mixes high and low brow jokes without resorting to toilet humor, it doesn't pull any punches (spot the social commentary), the performances are masterful and the script achieves depth without sacrificing the one-liners or slowing the pace.	9
 Best Thing Happen in Hollywood	Nothing to Say when You wanna say everything !you think that's a turnoff title, remember all the smart-ass things people said before Forrest Gump happened. Shawshank — the name refers to a maximum-security prison in Maine — is already being touted to join Gump in the Oscar race. Why not? The academy regularly drops its drawers for films that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit. And this baby strums that theme hard as inmate Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a Shawshank newcomer in 1946, strikes up a 20-year friendship with a lifer named Red (Morgan Freeman). They're both in jail for the Big One: murder.	10
 act	"In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs.In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library."	10
 Classic	This is my first review in awhile. Figured I would just review a classic because I don't have a lot of time. GREAT movie, classic, always a good watch on a rainy day with all my classics: Green Mile, Forest Gump, Usual Suspects, Pulp Fiction, Etc.Just wondered why I had to scroll to the bottom on IMDb in order to review. Could use a meta bar next to the rating review at the top of the page please. I will inquire.I love the book format this film shows. The narration and the climate build-up until the inevitable escape, leaving you edging to see how he does it, not leaving out how connected we were with the dean to wonder how he did it. I don't think anyone wanted to follow him down the rabbit hole.	8
 Brilliant!!	Best movie I've ever seen in quite a long time. it has everything. intrigue until the last minute, passionate and heartbreaking story.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	10
 its the grater movie can be watch	if any one need to know what is the meaning of the enjoy of watching cinema then he must watching this grate complete enjoyable movie, there is something attractive in this film, the story its written very well and the performance of the crew was more than perfect, i watch this movie again and again and i am always have the desire to watch it more and more, you cant feel boredom from this type of movies, you can feel the emotions of the characters like you are live with them, the events of this movie its touch the souls and move the emotions, its very realistic, i like the performance of Morgan Freeman in this movie, i think its the greatest actor, really this movie its deserve the reviews as number one on top 250 movies on IMDb,and i am sure its will stay there for very long coming time, i don't know why the companies of production doesn't support to creating like this movie now a days.	9
 great movie	"The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of movies like this.One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	8
 Sweet	This movie blow my mind, i love the character of Andy and his friend Red, i like the he overcome his problems and keep in mind his goal freedom. Love how he make all the plan to brake out form jail. i think is really cool the as always all runaways go and hide in Mexico. Like the idea of going to Zihuatanejo beach and build a ship and go travel all pacific Mexican cost. Andy was a really Smart man and i think this move shows how you can pass all bad things in life if you have a goal, and look for it. The only i didn't like was the fact the nobody prove the Andy was Innocent of killing his wife. or maybe he did, i think Andy find out the she was cheating on him and he plan the crime with the same method he plan his scape of prison, who knows?	8
 A testament to the human spirit	To me this is one of the classic. The story of a is unique prison break but with a lot of drama and suspense. Spiritually moving old-fashioned prison movie. I loved it. All the character got their own uniqueness and importance. Overall you have to watch it to feel it. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed. So, yeah I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.	10
 Best Movie Ever Seen	This is the Best Movie I have Ever Seen. I can't think of anyone not seeing this movie. If there was such a way that; I would erase my memory and watch this movie over and over again, I would definitely do it. The story is very smooth and you can not get your eyes off he screen. Even if you don't like such prison movies you should give this one a try. Because this one isn't just a prison movie, it tells and shows the real life events. Real people and real reactions to real events either they are good or bad. This is life itself. Sour, sweet and everything in between. Prepare to cry and laugh. Such a great intellect. I see similarities with the series OZ (1997-2003) and this movie. You may also want to check OZ as well. These two are perfect stories to experience. Also the actors and actresses played their roles perfectly. This is a masterpiece. You won't regret it.	10
 Get busy living or get busy dying..after a house fire those words mean a lot more		10
 Get busy living or get busy dying	"Every time I start losing hope about the future I watch this movie. ""Get busy living or get busy dying"" is my favorite quote. Simple as that. What amazed me is the fact that this movie is still No# 1 in Top 250 movies of all time votes after all these years. This means something about the general consciousness of the people of our times. Most of us are trapped in some sort of prison. Out there, somewhere is our Zihuatanejo, our true dream place, our destination. Is it a place on earth ? Heaven ? Tim Robbins acting is great and the unique and special voice of Morgan Freeman draws the audience into this strange world. There are so many memorable quotes. Bible scriptures are also quoted in interesting ways and angles that enrich the plot and storyline in a special way. Highly recommended to watch on Sunday nights, just before you face that scary Monday morning."	10

 Still Excellent To This Day.	I've grown up with my parents talking about how great this movie is and finally I've got round to seeing it. It really is as brilliant as they say. It's moving, powerful, emotional, and brilliantly acted. I particularly loved Morgan Freeman's character. It had the same sort of tone as Forest Gump, and now I am a certified fan. Despite its age,it's still as amazing and excellent today as it was after its release. Very impressed and I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. The plot twists are also very enjoyable. When we see that a hole has been made through the prison wall, and we see the main character crawling through a sewage pipe to escape! Remarkable, moving, powerful stuff. I might just go and re-watch it now.	10
 a movie about hope....	Well it was not until recently I saw this one....a few of my friends had seen it and were completely raving about it....finally saw it a few days back...it takes some time to fully absorb it....what an outstanding cinematic achievement....!!! It is a complete pity that the movie released in the year of 1994, because it was robbed of a well deserved Oscar, given pulp fiction and and Forrest gump also released the same year.....this movie has everything. ...memorable performances, characters, a good story....it also has a lot of repeat value...this is a kind of movie which you can go back to whenever you are down in life...there are a few cinematic liberties taken....but thats pardonable.	9

 The Best Film Ever?	Well, well, well, I finally got round to seeing this so-called masterpiece; praised as the best film ever and frankly, I agree.What makes this film a true viewing pleasure is a number of components. Firstly it is superbly filmed, capturing every moment at the best possible angle making it easy to watch. The performances are fantastic Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman play their parts exponentially well, so convincing you lose yourself in the Shawshank world. The music also makes the key moments of the plot ever more intense and moving. Another point is that it is not too long and drags on but is not cut too short; the perfect length.In conclusion, I would highly recommend it and I really enjoyed it with its exciting storey, great performances, fantastic music and the ideal length it is truly worth the title of the best film ever!	10
 A story about being a human		10
 Great movie	n 1946 a young New England banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins), is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life at the Shawshank State Prison - twice over. Quiet and introspective, he gradually strikes up a friendship with the prison 'fixer', Red (Freeman), and over the next two decades wins the trust of the governor and guards, but in his heart, he still yearns for freedom. Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (Birdman of Alcatraz, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast- forward button. Darabont plays the long game and wins: this is an engrossing, superbly acted yarn, while the Shawshank itself is a truly formidable mausoleum.	10
 Outstanding!	Wow, this is really the best movie ever made. Even though this movie contained a few mistakes, I'd like to rate it full-on-full. I want to tell this to all the people who haven't seen the movie, it's a must watch. You might think that 'Forrest Gump', The Best Picture Oscar winner can beat it, let me tell you, IT CANNOT! I'm serious! It is about a man, Andy Dufresne who has been put behind the bars for the murder of his wife and her lover, a Professional Golf player. But just like every other man in The Shawshank Prison, he too is innocent. Then he meets a, Ellis Boyd Redding, a smuggler/businessman and makes friends with him and his gang. Andy then asks him for a small rock hammer witch is soon delivered to him. He one day sees the names of prisoners written in the cell. He to goes to writ his name on the wall that is so weak that is comes out after which, he starts digging a hole in the wall. After 20 years of being in the jail and realizing how corrupt the warden is when he kills his friend, he escapes the prison and gets the warden so good that he suicides. The last thing that I'd like to say is that it should be rated 9.5 on IMDb but still, that's just a suggestion. 9.3 is good.	10
 Perfect		9
 Brilliant Movie!	I just rewatched this brilliant movie thinking seeing it a second time it would lose its impact. I was wrong. I was just as touched and amazed by this movie. This movie has everything a great film needs. From great story with a beautiful ending and fascinating characters, to great performances by every actor, to beautiful music and stunning cinematography. I could go on for ages why this movie is amazing. It doesn't have a single weak link in my opinion. Does it deserve to be #1? Maybe not. But it is one of my all-time favourite movies, and I enjoyed every single second of it. I would definitely recommend this movie.	10
 Another Masterpiece about prison life!	This film is yet another in an ever-growing list of excellent works of art that explain why I love Morgan Freeman! As usual, he holds your attention in the most powerfully subtle manner! Tim Robbins is FANTASTIC! He's so amazing in this role! It's worth watching at least three times. There's some hard-hitting stuff but that's to be expected in a prison film. The ending is so poignantly beautiful and simple yet has an incredible emotional impact if you allow yourself to be transported to that time and in their place. It helped me have a little more compassion for inmates and ex-convicts. It's not for anyone under 18, so don't allow minors to view it. I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. You won't be disappointed!	10
 The Perfect Prison Film	*SPOILERS* I'll just get it out of the way now. This is the prime example to prove that Morgan Freeman is among the greatest narrators ever, if not THE best. Tim Robbins, the lead in this movie, creates a great duo with Morgan Freeman, with the dialogue shared between the two feeling natural, as well as superb acting from both. The story line is what presents the backbone for these great performances as the narrative is a major part of what makes it one of the greatest films of all time. A man is accused for his wife's murder, is sent to prison where he serves life sentences which gives him the time to redeem himself (though he did not commit the crime is accused of) and eventually escape. The movie is full of great writing, acting, directing and cinematography and deserved to win at least one Oscar out of its seven nominations.	
 Best Movie I ever watched	"Movie/Film is called shadow of life or imagination. We watch for entertainment or learning or just for fun. All movies can't achieve the goal to satisfy its viewer but ""The Shawshank Redemption (1994)"" does beyond expectation. Those who fade up with their life should must watch The Shawshank Redemption (1994). Its a movie of inspiration. After watching the movie you realize it deserve the No.1 movie of IMDb top movies of all the time. Without watching the Review can't express its beauty. I've watches more than thousand movies but its the best. Still waiting for a movie in which I can give 10 out of 10. It got 9 form me but its my highest rating."	9
 Supperbbb movie..must watch	It is the best movie in the history of cinema. One of the best movies of all time. Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect. Probably one of the best films I have ever seen in my young life. Giving this a 10 won't do it justice. The Shawshank Redemption is just pure story telling at its best. No wasted moments and no pause of time ,just absolute, pure narrative. The cast is perfect with Morgan Freeman as Red completely stealing the show with his soothing narration style while Tim Robbins gives out a really great performance; a falsely convicted man who keeps it to himself. A film about hope and friendship in the toughest of situations, Shawshank is uplifting, provocative and awe inspiring. An absolute must watch.	10
 Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is sentenced to lifetime imprisonment when he is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover.	In my opinion, there are two different types of good movies (if not more). One type is the one where you can watch hundreds of times and still not get bored of it. The other is the one where is so memorable that watching one time will result in you remembering it forever, even if you never ever watch it again. Shawshank Redemption is the latter.The movie itself contains no fast-paced action or fantasy, but the gradual progression of the movie makes way for character growth and realism. In nearly 150 minutes, the viewers find themselves living and growing with Andy and Red, urging for them to make a move and yet never quite certain if they will.I don't really have any words that I can say about this movie other than the fact that it is the type of masterpiece that makes you think hard about everything.	9
 One of my top 10 movies!	I really liked this move and this is why my first review it's about it. First time I saw it, I was maybe 12, and even then, I was fascinated with it. A story of a life spent in prison and learning how to live with it, not giving up even everything seems lost, it was just breathtaking. The second time I saw it, I was a bit older and understood it better. I won't write about acting or the technical things but the movie as a whole. It is in deed a masterpiece. Only a few movies can say about themselves that everything was alright and if anything were different, it would't be such a great film.	10
 A film of true friendship	This is one of the best films I have ever seen, the first time I saw this, I became so enthralled, I couldn't take my eyes of it, I was glued to the T.V I have watched the film several times since and find it just as enthralling. The true friendship between the 2 characters was so powerful. The story was incredible, it made me laugh, and cry, the film was totally emotional. There wasn't any special effects in the film, but I think that is good The acting was great throughout. A defiantly must see film if you haven't seen it before. The ending shows such poetic justice, it was great. I think Morgan Freeman is a great actor in anything he does	10
 a must watch film for every film lover.		8
 No fluff, no gimmicks, just an incredible story	This is a great movie. The entire movie is filled with life changing themes that reveal how important integrity, friendship and hope is in this world. One person with a big heart can make such a difference. For being a simple drama without any real action, romance, or special effects, Shawshank Redemption does a phenomenal job of drawing in the viewer and creating intense scenes at every turn. The characters are vivid and easy to relate to. When so many movies today revolve around computer generated graphics, explosions, fight scenes, and sex, it is refreshing to watch a movie that reminds us all of what life is really about. Life sucks sometimes, but Andy looks past his circumstances in order to better the world he was forced into. The friendships he makes and the way in which Andy brightens up the world around him is inspirational.	10
 The Title Does Not Do Justice To This Movie	The Shawshank Redemption title rendered little inspiration to actually see the movie. It wasn't until word of mouth from those I trusted finally encourage me to see this film. It started with the violent death of his cheating wife and her lover by Andy Dufresne. He is wrongly convicted and sentenced two consecutive life sentences. He is sentenced to the fictional, but tough, Shawshank Penitentiary. As a white collar guy in a tough prison Andy befriends two fellow inmates. Morgan Freeman's poignant narration throughout the movie highlight the story and gives it credence. Tim Robbins character is able to win the favor and protection of the guards by using his financial skills to do their taxes. That enable him to earn the trust of the prison warden to do the books in a money laundering scheme.The ending of this movie has some very interesting twists and turns highlighted by a graphic narrative from Morgan Freeman.	9
 Great Movie	Great Movie based upon a true story. Beautiful cinematography. shows the life of a prisoner who is an innocent human being in reality. He is accused of killing his wife and is later sent to jail but he is so smart and intelligent that he's able to make himself calm for the whole time he is in jail and also able to establish good relations with every1 there including other prisoners. The turning point is when he surprises every1 by escaping the jail through an underground tunnel which he digs through the room where he is being kept. He crawls through the tunnel and ultimately makes his way out of the prison cell without being caught or detected by the guards. At the end of the film he is seen as a free man at a remote location far away from his work and home with loads of cash and wealth. Great story. Everyone must watch it.	8
 Action And Adventure.	"Mind Blowing and superb work by the actors and all of the crew.Nice Work!The way he escapes,showing love,using his mind e.t.cthe film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.Despite being a box office disappointment, the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism."	10
 Film Analysis	"The Shawshank Redemption is a film that plays out the story of Red's, Morgan Freemans, experiences, encounters, and friendships while imprisoned for murder. Red begins with his first encounter of Andy Dufresne, Tim Robbins. Andy was quit peculiar in the way in which he carried himself and his quietness, which intrigued Red. Andy requested a rock hammer from Red, from then on Andy and Red's friendship began to grow. The film shows the hardships prisoners experience, including being jumped and raped by the ""Sisters."" But the film also displays what good can be done within the prison, such as Andy, an experience banker, volunteering to do taxes and give financial advice to the guards in return for a better life behind bars for him and his friends. Andy uses his privilege to rejuvenate the prison's library and offering assistance to prisoners to obtain there high school equivalency. The film is spanned out over 40 years, showing the long term sentences these men have served. There are several themes as work in this film, but the most prominent one is the power of hope. Throughout the movie, glimmers of hope are expressed by the men but then soon shattered. The beginning scene of the bet of which ""New fish"" would cry was soon realized to be cruel and led to a prisoner's death. Throughout the movie, Red (Freeman) had lost all hope. Red displayed this loss of hope with his uncaring attitude displayed at his parole hearings. He had no motivation to express to the board that he was a changed man and was ready to return back to society. He said the same speech at almost every hearing which lead to his denial until he later regained hope for a brighter future and spoke of his regret to the parole board. Hope was also displayed through music, the singing French woman and the harmonica. A glimmer of hope was displayed for Red when his friend escaped prison, this hope grew when he was unexpectedly granted parole. Through Red's narrative, it seemed as his Red's fate was to be the same as Brooks, ""Institutionalized,"" but Red prevailed and pursued his long lost friend, Andy. The letter that Andy left for Red under the lava glass near the oak tree stated, ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" This changed Red, he now understood the saying ""Either get busy living, or get busy dying,"" and he chose life. Symbols used throughout the film were rocks and pinup posters of iconic women. Rocks were used ultimately to hide the true purpose of the rock hammer, but they were also a symbol of hope and normalcy. The posters of the iconic women, such as Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe, were posters to cover up Andy's true desire which was to escape this unjust imprisonment and return to his normal life. An example of good sound effects is the scenes leading up to Brooks' demise. The sound effects create a sense of understanding and realism; soft music is played as her narrates his final letter to his friends back at prison. Shots of the hustle and bustle of the city, cars whizzing by and honking at Brooks, the noisy and bossy grocery manager. In the final scene of him committing suicide, the noise of his pocket knife is very prominent and creak of the chair as he mounts it to carve his name in the rafter, and the sound of the chair being kicked away and the tension on the rope is heard. This is very realistic and somber. The music is soft which created an emotion of sadness and does not drown out the important subtle noises. A movie that shares some of the same themes and motifs is Green fried Tomatoes, this film portrays a significant amount of time and displays the power of hope as well. In conclusion, this film displays the power of hope and how it effects people when hope is lost. Andy's unwavering hope brings ""light"" to others around him, possibly saving their lives."	10
 Human again!		9
 One in the Top-10 List of Mine	"As far as I am concerned, I think it is a movie well worth watching. I am a senior high school student in China, and I really do not have lot of time to lead a free life as most of students abroad (stated in many books and stories in China). As is known to many people, there exists a strict examination (The National College Entrance Exam) in China, and each student only have one chance to attend it during his/her lifetime, so nobody will give it up and everyone is fighting for it.Just like Andy, Red and many other people in the Shawshank. Maybe most of us living creatures do not have a real freedom.It is a jailbreak story in many people's eyes, but it isn't just like that in my aspect. I regard it as a kind of redemption as the title of the movie. As is stated in Oxford Dictionary, ""REDEMPTION"" is ""the action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil"" or ""a thing that saves someone from error or evil"". In my opinion, both of its meaning was highlighted.I do not want to talk about this movie from performance, even if it is the soul of a movie. But I think there must be a more important thing.Red is a man lost his heart, even if he is always speaking ill of the guard, his eyes is like a silent street, he can bear anything, and he will not have a quarrel, he sentenced himself to death. Though he said he had been totally changed in the jail, nobody would like to APPROVE him of get out of it. But when he tell them his true words inside his heart, he was soon set free. It is just like a kind of joking, but I think it is of high applause. I don't know how to express it in an exact word in English, it means ""血性"" in Chinese.As for Andy, the other main character in this movie. He is an energetic bird looking forward to freedom, which is wise enough as well. Carving the wall, behind which is freedom. It takes him nineteen years. But it is fair. In his past life, though he was freer than that in Shawshank, he was also trapped. Trapped by his daily routines, by his wife's abandon or by those business and title he earned. For many of us, one should work until his sixties or older, and when he could enjoy his life, there is not very much left exactly. Andy used nineteen years to gain a freedom, and he got it faster than we.Maybe the western cannot get my idea, but in fact, a people in China even need to work in his seventies. There are thousands of rooms left empty, but most of people cannot have their own house in his whole life. That is the reason why I am longing for freedom.Owing to the blessing of the god, I have my own house with my family, we have cars. What's more, we do not have trouble in earning a living. Maybe I could say I am a born First-Class, but too many of us cannot be like that.WE NEED REDEMPTION.I have to say it is the Top-10 Movie I have ever watched. And it even can be the best TWO out of all, the other one is Leon."	10
 Orange is NOT the new black	The caption basically shows you my opinion of that movie. It is a top film with a great storyline and perfectly described characters who are performed by actors knowing their craft well. Furthermore I also praise Darabont for turning King's short story into an almost 3-hour long drama without losing the basic message of the book and its atmosphere. Namely how different the two main characters are who represent a certain life philosophy : Red is the pessimistic one who never raises hope because life taught him that there is none but Andy is the total opposite: He never loses his hope even in such a terrible place. Nevertheless it is definitively NOT the best film of all time! Come on my fellow IMDb voters, how can you deliberately ignore the other movie masterpieces?! It is the without doubt the best prison movie (The Green Mile?!) and also one of the best book-adaption but there a better movies...admit it!!	8
 Spellbound !	3576 reviews already in there .. what more can one possibly add ! and still i have the urge to write one .. for i feel it would be injustice not to ! the is my first review on IMDb .. and i'm very sure my last one too !This movie is a CLASSIC in every sense of the word . i wonder if there ever be another movie which brings about such a strong emotion from within. i have never experienced something like THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION ! and the most wonderful part about the movie is that it stays with you .. the characters .. the actors .. the plot .. the narration ! you can almost hear MORGAN FREEMAN every time you think about this wonderful piece of work. please don't miss this .. please watch it TODAY !	10
 One of the greatest movies ever made	"So the shawshank redemption is a 1994 prison movie staring Tim Robbins as former banker turned double murderer Andy Dufrense. When Andy's wife and her lover are found murdered at a country club Andy is blamed and sentenced to two back to back life sentences in the notorious Shawshank State penitentiary ran by a sadistic head guard named Byrom Hadley as well as the corrupt warden Samuel Norton. When Andy decides he wants a rock hammer to carry on his hobby of shaping rocks he meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Reading described as ""a man who knows how to get things"" Red is also ""the only guilty man in Shawshank"" as all other inmates claim they are innocent. Andy and Red quickly become friends as Andy repeatedly tries to convince all the other inmates that remembering there are places outside of Shawshank and they should not accept they may never leave the prison. Andy then takes a young high school dropout named Tommy under his wing to help him get his high school qualifications it is this boy that brings forth the revelation of Andy's innocents after telling the story of about a old cell mate who claims to have committed an identical crime which he got away with. After Andy's young friend is shot dead by Hadley Andy asks an inmate to get him a 6ft long piece of rope. the next morning Andy does not show for roll call and Red fears he has committed suicide however the do not find Andy hanging in his cell like Red expected they do not find him at all the night before a plan that took 19 years to get ready took place and Andy had escaped Shawshank prison. This is by far one of the greatest movies of all time Frank Darabont showcases his skill for the first of many times collaborating with Stephen King this movie should definitely be brought on blu-ray right now if you haven't seen it what are you waiting for."	10

 The Shawshank Redemption - Best Movie Ever!		
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen		10
 Get Busy Living	"Why do so many people love this film? We see a story that offers us all hope. There is hope, real hope, all of us can have. As a Christian, I see many reflections of the Gospel in this film. It is interesting to me, how so many love the film, yet reject Christianity and the message it brings. Again, it's simply interesting. It may say more about the Church than about those who love the movie. A question I always ask myself, who has the greater redemption in the film, Andy or Red? On the surface, many can see it as Andy. After all, he is wrongly convicted. He goes to prison. He escapes. He has his ultimate redemption. One can easily view the film in this light. However, I believe Red has the greater redemption. Here is why. Andy is goes to prison without committing the crime. Andy has a physical redemption. Yet, it is Andy who always has hope, always has a plan, and always brings light. To his inmates, to the world he inhabits. Red is guilty. His crime, his sin, has pervaded into his life. He has lost hope of what might be. His life is prison. He cannot escape, even as he gets out into the ""real world."" He is still not redeemed, spiritually in his soul. Andy's journey through the dark tunnel is a foreshadowing of the darker journey Red is walking. And we don't know if Red will survive. Yet Red has a redeemer. It is Andy. Andy never gives up on Red, even after he has escaped. He does everything he can to keep connecting, communicating, and reaching Red, to say to him - this is not the end, there is hope. You only have to take a step. You have to get busy living. Red does. He finds hope. He is truly redeemed. As a Christian, I see great connections between this film and the Gospel. I see in this story large elements of the Greatest Story. We have a Redeemer. He was without sin, He was not guilty, yet He came to us, in a world filled with sin, darkness, and death. He came to our Shawshank. He came to set the captives free. In this world, He healed, He taught, He educated, He cared for, He encouraged, He worked miracles. In this world, He continued to be wrongly accused, persecuted, beaten, mocked, and sentenced to death itself. He entered into the dark hole. He traversed through the darkest tunnel we can imagine. He rose again. Yet this was not the end. It was the beginning. The beginning of His work to continue reaching out to us, communicating to us, doing everything He could to say there is hope. He wrote us a letter in His Word, the Bible. He gave us the means to take the journey, a bus in essence, by His Church. He promised He would be there. And He is. He is waiting for us. He give hope and a home. Now and forever. Red's redemption can be a portrait of our greater redemption. We can say, like Red, ""I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel. A free man at a start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain."" We can be free, truly. We can have hope, fully. Now in the world. Forever, in the world to come. ""Get busy living."" Well said, Red."	10
 An amazing movie everyone will love	So, I first would like to say that this was a very good movie. While watching it I realized I was watching the highest rated movie in IMDb. It definitely deserved that rank. I was hooked right from the beginning. I will put an disclaimer for anybody who wants to see it that it being a rated R movie there is vulgar language, violence and showing of alcoholic beverages. Also there is a scene where there might be nudity but from what I can remember I think the most you'll see is some guys butts. The main plot of this movie is about a banker, Andy, who goes to prison because he is accused of killing his wife. He meets a guy named Red and they become best friends. This movie had the right amount of everything without having too much of something. It had comedy, drama, action. When watching this movie it made me think. One of the things I thought about is that life can change on the outside world when you're locked up for so long in an enclosed space. You also can feel so out of place that you'd rather go back to your enclosed space because that's all that you know and feel comfortable with. The movie explains that if you have hope then the outside world isn't too bad. This is a movie that I would recommend any adult to see. Even if you think you might not like this movie or it's not your cup of tea I believe you'll still enjoy it by the time you finish watching the film.	10
 Best ever	"Do I need to tell anything else? No, but I will, in Portuguese. The Shawshank Redemption was released over 20 years and is still the best of all. For many years simply ranks first in the Top250 IMDb. The performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are sensational. The plot, based on a short story by Stephen King, is exquisite. The director, Frank Darabont, also directed ""The Green Mile"", which, incidentally, is also based on a short story by Stephen King. The most wronged film in Oscar history. Gave chance to compete with another fantastic movie, Forrest Gump, which was more commercial, mainly because of the participation of Tom Hanks, who was high at the time, since it came from films such as Philadelphia and Sleepless in Seattle."	10
 One beautiful adventure!	This movie show's me many things about life. Everyone who didn't watched it must watch it at least one time in his lifetime. The actor play is on professional level. The things that this movie want to tell to all of the watcher are things that many people aren't learned still from life. Movies in top10 from top250 which are from 90's must be watched from everyone no matter young, old, white or black. Watching this movie it gives me one beautiful adventure. Every time when I think about this movie my mood gets better. In everyone hard moment I think about it and e feel much better. The rating of this move is not chance it's real.	10
 a brilliant movie ,i was to late to see	"Andy Dufrene a banker who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover which he constantly denies .He is sent for life sentence to shaw-shank state penitentiary where he befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding and spends his time doing unconventional thing to keep himself sane.The movie is narrated through the voice of red played brilliantly Morgan freeman who is the prison contraband supplier .Throughout out the movie we see red narrating many prisoners of shaw-shank but mostly focuses on Andy.The Entire movie focuses on various major activities of Andy through out his time in prison. the story also focuses on the subject of the mind state of a long time prisoners their inability to know whats their purpose outside prison ,unless they don't have proper support their only chances are either going back to prison or death.This is a true master-piece from frank Darabont (direction and screen play) and Stephen king .This movie is a 142 minute master- piece .please don't miss this movie"	10
 Awesome	This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.	10
 One of my favorite movies of all time	One of my favorite movies of all time. Powerful,thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. Thanks to quietly dignified performances and Darabont's own inventive direction, The Shawshank Redemption remains a first class example of how to approach potentially weighty issues with conviction, style, lightness and wit. Shawshank is one of those rare movies that defines the whole reason I love films. It tells a fantastic story, masterfully written, acted, and directed. You can't help but become emotionally invested in the characters and story, and because of that, the film leaves you emotionally drained by the film's end, but still with a sense of hope.	10
 Great	"Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years A great movie unrepeatable, The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation"	10
 Probably still the best movie		9
 Without A Doubt. One Of The Best Movies Ever.	This movie is a cult classic, so. so many memorable lines, so many good actors, such good directing and such a brilliant plot, such an inspiration for a lots of movies after this, i wish i had something bad to say about this movie, i actually enjoy finding faults with movies, but i can honestly say after seeing it, rethinking it and re- watching it, i can say a movie like this is a 10/10 ,not the BEST movie in history, i don't know if you can choose any movie for that title but it would be in the top 10 movies ever made. And i think i'm a pretty judgmental person, i nitpick the slightest bit of a continuity error and if a movie is 10/10 i would drop a point just for that 1 mistake. And i'm not like ''OMG THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER AND NO ONE CAN PROVE ME OTHERWISE!!!!' no, a movie might come around that is probably better, i think there are 1 or 2 that are better already but plot and twist-wise, this is the best in that category, this movie is really REALLY worth seeing.

 Shawshank Review - A True Modern Classic	There are thousands of written reviews for this film on this website and the majority of them positive. I know I am just adding to this long list of positive reviews, but I feel this film deserves to be my first review on this website. While this film may not be my favourite film, it is most definitely a film I respect. When I was young and watching 'The Goonies' and 'Back to the Future' I thought films were only made to entertain and were not made to convey a clear message about humanity. This film was the first film I watched that made me understand that the film medium could provide the world with such philosophical messages and could teach young people, like me, that life must be valued. Pretty deep right? Well this is the message that the film carries. Red values Andy's friendship and life. He does not want him to die and wants him to survive and when I was watching this film I thought... wow! Two prisoners, one who definitely killed another person, can be so rational and kind. I learnt from this film that the world is a horrible place and emotions can get the better of people; but through it all, it is about moving on and making sure that one is not affected by the emotional trauma that has arrived at their front door and instead take that trauma and improve themselves and other people like Andy did throughout the film. By the end, when Red and Andy are embracing on the beach, free, I see two men who have been through years of pain and self-pity clear of all negative thoughts; I see two friends that through all the emotional trauma that we see them going through are still strong.Now I can talk about themes and the impact that this film had on me all day long, but I have to praise everyone involved in this film. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman embody their characters perfectly and when I watch it now as a 17 year old who has seen his fair share of great performances these stick out as real people and not simply a performance. Frank Darababont, who not only directed the film but also wrote it, crafts a film that is very entertaining to watch but that also conveys these themes effortlessly and writes some very memorable lines that really affect one's perspective on human nature. The scene with Brooks is a scene that had me close to tears and that showed me the impact of being 'institutionalized'.Anyway, I have said enough about this film. It is very good and really pushed me into seeing films in a different light. If you want to read any more reviews or my list on my favourite films of all time please check me out. Thank you for reading this.	9
 My favourite Movie ever! WARNING CONTAINS SPOILERS		9
 Awesome	Parents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.-Common Sense Media	10
 Prison movies are always Keepers	"Firstly I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue.The Shawshank Redemption is a perfectly woven, superbly performed, and flawlessly shot cinematic masterpiece that is sure to never be forgotten. Along with Darabont's other prison outing, The Green Mile, he has crafted a pair of subtly affecting dramas with real heart. Shawshank, however takes the prize. Phenomenal stuff. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?"	10

 One of the best movies ever	"Superb. Great. Masterpiece. Unforgettable. Excellent.Brilliant. No, no , no. I have been thinking for months to find a word that can describe the film. Nothing's found yet and , to be honest, I think nothing will be found forever.The movie can't be expressed by words. Words are unable to talk about it and I have nothing to say about this masterpiece. But I'm hopeful to be able one day to express my feelings about it because ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"" When it come to the Shawshank Redemption, I prefer to remain silent because ""silence is full of unspoken words"""	10
 Cinematic genius at its best!!	"Best movie I've ever seen. I keep this movie on auto-play. Great casting. Tim Robbins portrayal of Andy Dufresne, an innocent man in prison, who has to break the law while in prison, to live a free life as a fugitive on the run, outside of prison. James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin, gave a wonderful performance as a man who spent his whole life as a caged bird, once given his wings, he has forgotten how to fly free. Instead of living in a cage again, he opted for a pine box. A solitary man, in a solitary cage, for all eternity. Knowing that the character of Ellis ""Red"" Redding, in the book, is supposed to be a middle-aged Irish man, Frank Darabont's casting of Morgan Freeman solidified this character and brought to life the authoritative demeanor that only Morgan Freeman could pull off. There were many other actors who were considered for the role of ""Red"" but Morgan Freeman pulled off a commanding performance.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, was a great casting coup. Seeing him play an innocent man who is forced to conspire with the prison warden, in order to be free of the resident prison bullies, commit money laundering, in order to plan the perfect jailbreak and live life outside of prison as a free man, with a new identity that is ""the 3rd cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.""Clancy Brown as Capt. Byron Hadley, the sadistic jail warden, who gets off on beating prisoners who don't do what he says. Great character actor. William Sadler & Bob Gunton are another great character actors. Bob delivers a great role as a ""holier than thou,"" bible-thumping Christian with greed & corruption on the brain. In the end, Karma serves her justice in the form of a .38 to the head. the movie is full of suspense and has you rooting for the ""innocent"" guy at the end. Worth watching over and over again."	10
 iconic	An emotional ride with truly believable characters which have more heart than most modern movies. well worth its position at top of the table... a masterpiece, a movie which all movies fail to reach, it doesn't need superhero's or special effects, it just has a solid story which could happen to anyone, a fluidity which speeds by and left you wanting more at the end... what happens?... we all want to see how the lives of each of the main characters turn out at the end.. we know (Spoilers) they meet up after prison.. but how do they spend the rest of their lives?... together forever?.. or just a passing visit.. a movie this length which wants you to see even more.. is groundbreaking .. anyone who has not seen this movie.. shame on you all.. if your on netflix tonight and dunno what to watch this is the movie for you and trust me you shall not be disappointed.. Morgan freeman's voice alone should merit a watch.. Tim Robbins.. a role of his career	10
 The Shawshank Redemption review		9
 The Best Movie Ever, Why ?	"Well how i can start, before watching the movie for the first time i told myself that i would be fare and judge the movie far from the fact that it is ranked no.1 on IMDb , so here it is I opened it and couldn't move away from the screen for 142 minutes, it is not just any movie it is honestly a piece of art ! The movie talks about friendship, love , crime , passion, corruption but the most important of all is HOPE, ""hope is a dangerous thing"" that is the fact we should all know, but how many of us can face the danger? Which amazed me more in the movie that it gave us the fact that some people are dead even if they look alive, because if we don't live as we want we are already dead people! Yes it is the best movie I've ever watched, and I wish to see other masterpieces from Darabont in the near future."	10
 Greatest movie ever!		10
 Well-crafted saga of crime and innocence, abuse and retribution	"Most often when we see a prison film, we think of Oz with a bunch of ruthless convicts, shower rape, and cartons of cigarettes. Shawshank gives a much different perspective. While it has subtle notes of the norm, there is much more emphasis on how one does and passes time, hard time, in a penile system wrought with conflicts. We have a true innocent--a well-read and good-hearted man, Andy Dufresne, caught up in a prepubescent justice system, void of forensic evidence and ballistic reports, teeming with graft and greed on the behalf of the ""God- fearing"" warden. In this world, the guards are more murderous than the inmates, friends stick together more than families, and becoming conditioned to the system gives parolees nightmares about their impending freedom. This story is akin to The Count of Monte Cristo and Alexandre Dumas even gets a brief shout-out in a library scene. For more reason than I can state in this brief review this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and one of a seldom group to which I have given a perfect rating. It is worth the two hours of screening time and you will find yourself rooting for Andy and Red to the very end."	10
 The best Movie i have ever seen !!		10
 The best movie ever made!		10
 10/10 90s classic	This movie is based on a novella by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goofball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.	10

 Genius	Great planning from the beginning to end I appreciate his planning A hope is always keeps a man alive rather it would complete or not but hope always has a helping hand to human to be positive and keep struggle for their destination and be strategic for his planning this movie also shown the long term planning which is positive and legit when i hear about this movie i thought it would be boring movie and when i sit to see it it is actually boring in starting you have to wait for new climax in the movie after half of the movie i got interest to watch what would Andy do if he fails to flee from prison but it keeps interest with Andy's long strategy for years and eventually he accomplished with his mind blowing planning to get new identity and full bank balance of jailer well it's a great movie to watch	9
 Extremely great movie, I suggest watching it!	Mr. King always knows how to tell a tale of horror and suspense very well, that is no different for The Shawshank Redemption. It a thriller to the max and had me jumping out of my seat periodically throughput the movie. On the movie itself i admired the script and the way they drew you in and consumed you into their perspective. Kings movies always have a way to confuse you which is an admiring move being that the plot twists are what make a great movie. In my opinion he could have threw in a little less suspense and the movie still would have had as much of a phenomenal turnout. The quality is fantastic. Not everyones perspectives are the same so i suggest you go ahead and give the movie a watch for yourself!	9
 Outstanding to the core	I like watching movies,that's one of things I like doing in my free time. I prefer watching movies which have a critical acclaim,some of them have been popular for the moral or for the twists.it either touches your heart or blows your mind,but this movie does both and very efficiently. Just when you start imagining what the end is going to be like,the twist seriously blows your mind away. Hatsoff to the script and brilliant execution and to add a cherry to the cake the performances by the lead actors.this is the second movie I have ever reviewed and I had to do it. No wonder this is at the top of list when it comes to the ratings. It's sad we don't have a lot of movie's like this one. It really shows if you have hope then no situation is too hard, too adverse to come out of it. It might take some time, but it's worth it. It's better to even die trying than to live regretting.	10
 Dream and salvation	"The film I watched it several times, every time is not the same feeling, perhaps this is the charm of the film. This film is not simply to evaluate how, only to see their own to realize what is really classic. It is difficult to have relevance and meaning of these two words interpretation of dreams and save a movie can be better than ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the movie to bring psychological shock and washing has never been so deep, two lines and two black male protagonist Andy Reed together created a dream about freedom and soul save the best story, when the movie, can not help feeling compared to Andy's experience, we seem to be in a life but the ridge could be what, this is the temperature of the film, in fact the life has a dream, even if failure, as long as the heart has the dream, we will be able to get the hope of salvation."	10
 Indeed a Best Movie	"You want a Connection with Movie ? You want a story that should continue in the movie ? You want to connect your Emotions with the movie ? ""Hope""is the Answer For The Shawshank Redemption Simple approach yet dramatic appeal . The Answer - HOPE is the displayed with classical touch of relation to the character and human spirit. Life Can break your Knees but your mind can stand up bright if you have hope is the best message passed on by The Shawshank Redemption through the movie. Mr Director has a simple way of conveying the idea of plot by properly justifying the characters and their role with qualities they en role."	9
 A great movie	Shawshank Redemption is hands down one of the best movies that I've ever seen and probably will be one of my favorite movies of all time. I think what really made this movie stand out to me was how vividly all the actors portrayed their roles. The warden, Andy, red, brooks, the officers, the homosexual men. All these personas portrayed by the various actors gave life to the story and to each and every moment within a movie. It truly is a 10 of 10 IMO. Also I think I simply enjoyed how Andy got what he deserved after he escaped from prison. There's a lot to say about the plot and all the actors but I really became enamored by Andy as a character and just seeing him free made me enjoy the movie that much more.	10
 awesome movie	"the best movie ever. I really enjoyed the music and cinematography in the film. I can definitely relate to the characters in the film. I can close my eyes and envision myself in their reality. Such a wonderfully written movie with a very inspiring storyline. I would recommend this film to my children and my generations to come. the only downfall is the movie is quite long and there are plenty of parts that needed to be edited out and put in the ""Deleted Scenes"" section. I lost my grandmother when I first watched this film and it made me think a lot about life and about my meaning of existence. This movie inspired me into thinking and viewing the world in a wider sense and with an open mind."	10
 My one problem with the movie	"I enjoy this movie and have seen it multiple times. My only issue with the movie is that the character, Red (Morgan Freeman) is not accurate for the time period of the movie. I seriously doubt that Red because of his race would be such a leader of all inmates in the 1940's. And, the ""go to"" inmate for buying items? I doubt it. Some strong willed white inmate would have corned that market. He might have been a leader of the African Americans in the prison, but not the whites. Now before that starts some race debate about the topic, I only am pointing out how the times were in the 1940's, 50's, etc. My issue with that topic is that I think we should accurately portray society as it was no matter how ugly it was, not as we wish it had been."	10
 the best	its one of the I liked the first Blade film if slightly. It was a fun movie with some very cool moments, but didn't live up to the hype. The third, 'Trinity' is a mind-numbing disaster. Oh the difference a good director can make! Guillermo del Toro (Cronos, Hellboy) has the reigns here and clearly had a good time with the movie: it briskly bounces from one energetic action sequence to the next, with a fair number of frightful sights thrown in to liven things up. This is a good thing -- with a wafer-thin plot that takes enough turns to keep your attention, Del Toro knows exactly what kind of movie he's making: a pure action flick. And he delivers the goods. The movie is dripping with cool, and while it may not be a classic, it's a fun flick to throw on and let it suck you in.	9
 Great!	"I remember watching this movie whilst I was very young. My mum cried, basically as soon as the title popped up until the credits. Sometimes you forget things and then there are times when you remember something very vividly. I recall this movie making me feel very sad but it was a deep sadness not easily fixed with a ""it's just a movie"" comfort. Freedom is one of the very few things we really have and I simply cannot imagine being locked up, no matter for how long, and for something incredibly unfair. When Andy escapes and at last breathes in deep, I breathed with him and I felt looking at freedom as ours. Even though I really enjoyed this movie I have been unable to watch it again for fear of feeling too much again, it was that good."	9

 awesome	"simple approach to art can be a virtue when chaos reigns in the world. Just like the neo-folk music that serves as its soundtrack while providing an emotional salve for its characters, ""Song One"" initially serves as a lilting if sometimes downbeat respite from the cacophony that often passes as cinema today.But even a stripped-down emo-ode to the healing power of music needs to build up to a satisfying crescendo. In her feature debut, writer/director Kate Barker-Froyland tends to tiptoe away from the dramatic high notes that audiences often crave and comes up a stanza or two short from a fulfilling resolution.Often, ""Song One"" feels like the timid B-side of last summer's more satisfying music-biz saga, the much less woe-is-me and a lot more let's-have-some-fun ""Begin Again."" Unlike many low-budget indie titles, however, the novice filmmaker does have the benefit of a couple of actual stars in her cast. They go far to help carry this story about how a young woman reconnects with her family in New York after a car accident leaves her estranged brother (""Boardwalk Empire's"" Ben Rosenfield), a Brooklyn-based busker, in a coma.As Franny, a rather sullen globe-trotting anthropologist working on her doctorate, Anne Hathaway—looking like the early Liza Minnelli with her gamine hairdo—isn't quite as distraught as she was while winning her 2012 supporting Oscar as miserable prostitute Fantine in ""Les Miserables"" or as a weepy astronaut in last year's ""Interstellar."" Still, her big-screen crying jag continues apace as she and her mother (Mary Steenburgen, who does what she can as a self-absorbed intellectual whose props include American Spirit cigarettes and a twee accordion) take turns sitting vigil in the hospital while hoping for a miracle. Remember when Hathaway charmed us as a quick-witted gangly Everygirl in ""The Princess Diaries"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" that could make us laugh? Where has she gone? Back to the plot. Lacking a sanctuary while back home—her mother has symbolically given her bed away to her mail person—Franny stays in Henry's room and, like the anthropologist she is, steeps herself in what he has been up to while pursuing his music dreams. Besides recordings, there is a journal stuffed with scribblings: lyrics, deep thoughts, photos—and, lo and behold, a ticket to an upcoming concert by his favorite balladeer, James Forester.If you get an inkling that Franny and hipster-poet James will get involved romantically after she tells him about Henry's situation and his admiration for him, that would be a bingo. Johnny Flynn, the English actor-musician who plays James, duly possesses the soulful eyes and shy presence of a folk artist. And he certainly sings and performs well enough, both on guitar and violin. It is not hard to believe that countless giggly girls in their summer frocks would line up after the show to see him.He is also kind enough to stop by to see Henry the next day. Alas, his character is soon revealed to have all the personality of a very sincere though slightly damp sponge. It also is a little too convenient that he has been dumped by his girlfriend, which has blocked his talent for composing new material. Guess who will be his next muse? Bingo again.What time Franny doesn't spend with James in clubs is devoted to appealing to Henry's senses with familiar sounds and smells in the hopes it will stir him. She records street noises for him to hear. She buys takeout pancakes from his favorite all-night diner and pours syrup on them in front of his nose. Franny even shells out money for an antique gramophone to replace one that Henry broke and spins some scratchy records on it in his hospital room. Will her efforts pay off? Will we be able to tolerate her and James' somewhat ill-advised relationship long enough to find out? One wonders what Hathaway saw in this only partially-baked story. It turns out Barker-Froyland was an assistant to ""Prada"" director David Frankel, and it is nice to know that the actress is supporting her climb up the Hollywood ladder.But for those hoping that Ms. ""Les Miz"" will sing again for her supper, given the subject matter of ""Song One,"" you will have to settle for Hathaway's intentionally amateurish crooning of America's soporific '70s chestnut ""I Need You."" At least she knew better than to revive ""A Horse With No Name."""	8
 Great Movie	Good movie yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.Will surely watch again.	
 My Faivorate Movie Ever		10
 Outstanding in every aspect	The first time I watched this movie was around 10 years ago and since then I forgot its name. two years ago it crossed my mind but I wasn't able to remember the name and i tried every possible way to remember it. finally I got it and I can't describe my feelings at that moment. Since then I watched it for more than 10 times, and I will watch it again. Can any movie beat it?absolutely no What can make sucha movie incredible? everything I rarely cry for a realistic events or for a fiction ones but I cry every time I watch this movie. Is is better than the godfather? out of question Is it gonna be forgotten? No way The movie didn't win any Oscar! who cares	10
 Incredible!!!!!	With little bit of suspense,it's make me insane. It's one of the best movie i have ever seen. I was very enjoying the movie. escape plan of Andy Dufresne is amazing but most amazing thing was the identity of Andy Dufresne simply clever. Morgan Freeman is always enjoyed to watch. Tim Robbins is give dedication to this role is exceptionally well. Tim Robbins feels that role and feel like it's alive. Other guy like Bob Gunton,William Sadler supports very well in this film.Segment in which reveal that how Andy Dufresne was escaped with help of small tool.It's interesting movie to watch with one seat.Never wanted to go away and missed any shot.So i can describe it as clever,Incredible,Excellent.	10
 Prison escape.	Very good movie. I can't say anything bad about it. It was touching, exiting and grand!I saw this movie for the first time when I was very young, even though I didn't understand everything but I still loved it. I find so many levels of entertaining in this movie, I have seen it many times, and every time I see something new!The prison brake part is very clever, and so exiting! The idea is great and it is one of my favorite movies.I would recommend it to anyone, young or old, man or woman10/10 if I could give it more, I would!	9
 An instant and classic masterpiece of all time!	The Shawshank Redemption is a very moving picture. Top class performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman even lift the movie higher. Supporting performances by Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown,James Whitmore are also commendable. The screenplay is top notch, it hooks you up to your seat till the last moment. Background score of the movie is exhilarating at many parts and deserves a special mention. The locations are also good, giving the viewer a realistic feeling. In the end it conveys an important moral of life- patience and tolerance always pays. I wonder why this movie was a commercial disappointment. It is and still remains one of my favorite movies. Enjoy watching the movie!	9
 It's good	"I highly recommend this. You should watch it. It is a good movie. Watch it now. Watch this. Watch it. Do it. Now Go.What are you waiting for?This is a movie about a man who goes to prison. He meets people. They talk. They talk a lot. People die. People get free. He does not get free. People talk more. More people die. Morgan Freeman stars as a man named ""Red"" in this flick. Watch it. Bob Gutton stars as the Warden. He is a meany.Do yourself a favor and go watch it now. Get busy living, or get busy dying."	9
 Pretty good	A good film. But I find it is over marked for the standard of film. Morgan Freeman's acting cannot be flawed but Tim Robinson, as good as he was, never seemed to show enough energy or desperation to portey the role. The direction of the film is insane. The camera work seems to let it down though, where there is a lot of wide screen moments, which could have been close ups. This would have emphasised the acting. In my opinion the role Tim Robinson played could have used a better actor, however I do think he is a very talented actor. Perhaps a better actor could have been Brad Pitt. His acting in Se7en shows that he can play an angry, loving and deperate character and I think he would have done the role more justice. Overall the film was very good but not as good enough to be the best film ever.	8
 I was once so naive		10
 its just an escape . But not from prison , from ordinary to extraordinary	According to me.As i have seen this movie for over 11 times .I don't believe it is a one time watcher .It is too good .Especially the casting the story is told in such a way that even I ( a moderate movie lover) understands the concept and loves to say a word or two. Even though Andy Dufresne is the lead .The character that stays in our minds is obviously Morgan Freemans' RED .He has shown some thing that is not so ordinary.And the Warden,,,Man i hate him so much that i love him.... That's it it ends here and it starts here.as told it is an escape,not from prison but from ordinary to extra ordinary .And i simply love it .And i love the way it is told	10
 Get Busy Watching Shawshank Redemption	"The Shawshank Redemption is hands down the best movie of all time. I will type that again, Shawshank Redemption is the best movie.....EVER. Everything about this movie is amazing. This is Tim Robbins best work, Morgan Freeman is perfect as Red in every frame of the film and everybody else is great in their roles. Every time I see this film I love it just a little bit more and it still stands as one of the best examples of hope ever to be put on film. It also has one of the lines in film history, which I have quoted often in my life, ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" So overall, a total Masterpiece. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5PyYKla1G8"	10
 The Best Movie of All Time!	The best movie of all time! Great acting, great story, great emotions and breathtaking moments. When you see the way that Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman acting, you suddenly feel and think that there is no better actors for this roles and this film. The escaping scene of Tim Robbins.. There are not many words to describe this moments. The happiness and the relaxation that he feels is indescribable. But showing us the way he feels this feelings is more than indescribable, it is amazing! The story of each character is fitting the best way that it could. We must all be thankful for watching this movie and thankful for each person that contributed this movie.	10
 A classic that should never be forgotten	Having watched The Shawshank Redemption for like a thousand times, I just can't stop watching it again every year or so.Not just the jail breaking is fantastic, but the whole plot is well designed.Andie paid 20 years in prison, rescuing both his physical freedom and his free mind.I would say that anybody who has watched it will surely find it enlightening and inspiring, pushing us forward, letting us know that without a brave heart and unchained soul, we would always be imprisoned deeply inside us. Speaking of the film, Morgan Freeman is the one that close all the clues of the story, a narrator who told the audience how this amazing redemption story happened.Can't say more about his performance, always natural , giving us a sense of reassurance.And other actors did a quite good job, too.Very detailed and precise. So if you are someone who had never watch this movie, I suggest you do it A.S.A.P , before you get called a who–never–go–to–cinema douche.	10
 True Redemption		10
 Great Film for Non-Action Fans, Possibly Just a Little Overrated...	"So the story is about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a man who has been falsely sentenced to prison. In prison, he meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), to help him understand many things about life within the four walls. The newcomer seems different than most of the rest though, and, especially in the beginning, attempts to give his co- prisoners moments to live for, moments forgotten for most of them through simple and imaginative ways. As time goes by, he comes to terms with what has happened and (no matter how he tries to help and evolve), he understands what he is supposed to do for the rest of his life. But there is one thing he won't let go: Hope.I will agree with those who have an issue with the fact that this movie is considered to be ""the best of all time"". I think it's really not THAT good. Although I understand it may has a reason and it's on purpose, the pace is slow (could be characterized ""too slow"") and the music (pretty important for this class of a movie) is ""eh.."" And last complaint: Gil Belows as ""Tommy"" was so annoying...Having said that, there is no one who can deny that it's a beautiful story and greatly told. It's pretty simple really. And it's that simplicity of the story that makes it great... The film takes place in a prison and while most of the people who are going to see it have never been in prison (obviously), Frank Darabont makes you connect with every single character in the film. And he does it so elegantly, you won't even understand it happened. It says more about hope and life with lost purpose than any other film I have recently seen. And when I say ""recently"", I mean films that have been out there the last 20 years. The performances in the movie are extraordinary. Morgan Freeman is great and I guess, even if most people don't really like him, Tim Robbins plays a role he fits exactly into. Bob Gunton is the perfect Warden to portray the necessary villain. I didn't really like William Sadler as Haywood but hey... that's the point, ""not to like him"", right? What I really liked most is the way this movie found time to cover all those issues without losing it's focus. It's great how you are not distracted at all when several things take place, while they are not contributing to the full-story. And yet... you care. Because it's something more than just a case or a chase... It's about life. And you can never get bored in this movie if you're watching to learn something. That's why the people who choose this movie to be moved and capture something emotionally greater and more ambitious than huge gunfights and cop-stories, will be fully pleased. People who choose this expecting for the bomb to blow up and some guys yelling ""Get Down!"" and swearing... sorry, this is not for you."	9
 One of the best movie I had ever seen	Love the Title Love the movie. So much detail on jail. How Andy got violated, how people are treated in jail. I assume sometimes during movie that if I get to jail how it would turnout to me! And believe me I was terrified to think me as a prisoner.An interesting turnover at the last part of the movie where Andy break out with a tiny hammer. Another turnover about when RED becomes free. I think Most of the viewers expected a tragic end but it's a happy ending and that what everyone wanted. Hope is the best thing in the world. And it is hope which leads Andy to break out and doesn't lead RED to commit suicide. But for Brooks there was no hope for him so he did commit death himself.	10
 Simply Great	Great Actors, great Direction and a fascinating story from beginning till the End. After all these years it's still one of the best Movies ever. Morgan Freeman shows once again, that he is a great actor. Tim Robbins becomes better and better till the great ending of the Movie. It shows, that Stephen King is not just a master of horror. He is also a master of storytelling. Thomas Newman was a great choice for the soundtrack. The movie is so good, that even the parody versions of it are great. For example in Drawn Together and the Simpsons. It's a timeless classic. Every movie fan should have watched it. So sit back and enjoy.	10
 Inchisoarea Ingerilor	"Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone Strong acting. Moderately inventive story, but not exactly unpredictable. A pleasantly uplifting film, but don't expect a transformative experience. PS -- Love the ""Sisters"" -- wish they won!"	10
 My favorite movie ever		10
 What was prison life like and has it changed?	I would never have thought that prison life would have been like this but in all honesty, i can relate now, having had to go into US Federal prison myself much later on in life after having watched this film. This film is just incredible in how it captured the spirit of ordinary people caught up in the prison system which is still in place to this day. We refer to it as the meat grinder. The film captures how people, through their own misfortunes and circumstances have found themselves in prison, even though they might not be a 'criminal' in essence. the emotion of the film is just awesome and this is why it will always be referred to when anyone is talking about prison or prison films. the ultimate classic film.	10
 Such a splendid yet silent and calm movie	as if nothing happens, happens every goddamn thing. too bad Darabont never made another great one.There is nothing good to be said about Let's Be Cops; there are only different shades of terrible. It is a comedy with immature-as-hell main characters and one joke each from director Luke Greenfield and his writing partner Nicholas Thomas. The best one can say is that the banter between the two leads seems credible, although that is little comfort when we would rather they kept their mouths shut. Ryan (Jake Johnson) and Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) are two losers in Los Angeles who are also both house mates and best friends. That may not sound possible, but the director found a world where they show astonishing patience for each other, perhaps because neither could feasibly envy the life of the other. Ryan used to play American football but got injured many years ago and is now the face of an STD medication. Justin works at a video game company, where his ideas are shot down by a horrible boss.	
 Excelente Película		10
 A little bit of everything!	"I personally love a movie that is able to satisfy my wildly growing curiosity. This movie answered every question that I had, which is not always for the best because of coarse every movie maker wants to leave us wanting more when the movie was over. But there was something about ""The Shawshank Redemption"" that was different. The film gave a movie lover exactly what they needed, well at least for me personally. The things in a movie that make people reconsider their own personal lives tend to be the best parts. To my surprise I did not cry while watching this film, because even with the murder, suicide, theft, rape, torture and pain in this movie. I still can say, in a strange way it was a happy story that changed my output on life for the better."	10
 Masterfully Done	I don't really write movie reviews and I won't go into too much depth here. My forte is writing sports blogs and articles but I felt obliged to say a little something on this amazing film.Short and sweet, this film is captivating, brilliantly written, produced and acted by an all-star cast. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are a dynamic duo that draw you in and hold you down. Escape from this movie is impossible and you find yourself more enamored with each scene.As a new actor and someone who thoroughly enjoys movies, writing and artistry of many formats, I hope to one day be half as good as the actors in Shawshank. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a huge favor and sit down, grab a cold drink and some salty snacks and enjoy!	10
 Friendship and hope overcome all.	"One of my favourite films all time. Shawshank Redemption is a story about mans hope and how friendship can overcome all. The cast give a great performance throughout the picture. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 Iconic!!!	One of the greatest and true pieces of cinematic masterpiece. Shawshank will forever be in at least the top 25 movies to watch of all times. I can watch it over and over again and never tire from it.The Movie allows you to ponder the troubles in your own life, that no matter what problems, no matter what is bringing you down; as long as your mind stays strong then the skies the limit. Shawshank is not only a prison movie, but a movie about humanity and acceptance. Tim Robbins character is so smooth with out a care in the world, its if like prison life doesn't even phase him, but it just showed that no matter how he felt and how hard of a time this character suffered, he was in time befriended and accepted for who he is and how strong willed he proved to be.	10

 A Classically Amazing Movie	The Shawshank Redemption wasn't a commercial success, largely due to its strange name, but now many people consider it one of the best movies of all time thanks to an incredible mix of drama, prison, and touches of action and mystery to liven things up. This is a story about justice and the law, and it's also incredibly poignant. I cried the first time I saw it. It takes place over about 20 years, which is somewhat incredible, and we get to be firsthand witnesses to Andy's time in jail over such a long period of time. This is especially great when you add in all of the supporting characters the movie has to offer, like Red, Brooks, and the Warden. I was actually sad when I first saw this movie, because when it finished I realized that I'd just seen the greatest movie ever and I would never be able to see it for the first time again. 10/10. Incredible, incredible movie.	10
 Not a masterpiece	"This will be a short review because, after all, I have not a lot of things to say about this movie. N°1 movie on IMDb, Amercian Film Institute 72nd best film of all time, 91% on rottentomatoes, I had to see this ""masterpiece"". Well, this is in no case worthy of the name, it's an excellent movie, but not to the point of deserving such a worship. The story is very beautiful and the characters are very touching but, from a purely cinematographic point of view, there's nothing amazing about it. Any movie from Kubrick, for instance, deserve way more the first place on IMDb than The Shawshank Redemption because it really marked film history (I'm talking about Kubrick because it's the first name that popped into my head, but it's not the only one obviously). I still recommend this very beautiful movie, of course, but if I had to do a list of the best films of all time according to me, it would never be in it."	8
 Best movie	Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt the most uplifting and touching film I have ever seen. The acting was brilliant, you believed what everyone said (some films the words are delivered with such cheesiness and fake ness, that it makes you want to throw up). I have watched Spiderman, and even the lines in that make you feel that they mean nothing, they just sound good. But every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.	10
 There is No Shank in Redemption	"A man who was in the midst of Deception; deciding to follow it in, and with using another sin. He began to sober up, but he was too late, he turned and caught the justice of the two lovers fate. He found himself locked with in. Finding foes and friend, that sums it up for corruption. He was placed in the Dark, seeing glimpses of the light. Only to feel the need to escape his plight. He kept real cool, as far as everyone knew, but underneath his skin, a hole began to cave in. When all was said and done, his salvation laid just behind another women. Out of the tunnel in his mind, and through the muck, he was baptized. This was the man we called Andy, who ended his journey keeping the chess board ready. Seeing his new found friend, walking toward him in the sand. As he had just escaped, using the words ""I don't give a Damn""."	10
 Rating is correct	Before watching any movie, I do read reviews here and this is correct one as far as stars go. It is really engaging in a sense that although it is long, does not bore you. It is emotional and you are bound to shed a few tears. I don't know many movies with two main actors, but their roles here are very truthful to what may be real persons experiences. I loved the movie also because it does give you hope that injustices done by others to you will be - one day or eventually - 'paid' in a way or that something good is waiting for you after the hard times. Anyway, a story you can not simply not love. I may see it 20 years later, but it is universal movie. Go and see it	9

 Amazing	I am a teenage girl so I didn't think I would like this film at all! However my dad forced me to watch it and I am so glad he did because it is one of the most amazing, hard hitting films I've ever seen! There are really funny parts and also some upsetting moments but I absolutely loved it and actually cried just because of how good the film was! I think anyone would enjoy this film! All of the actors are really good and they made me feel like they were the character and they weren't just acting the part. This is a warm film that sometimes makes you feel like you actually know the characters and they are all so different.

 Shawshank Redemption		10
 An impressive film		9
 Gripping Storyline	Yet another time i watched, so did I in the past few years. Adding life to years and not years to you life is nicely put in the movie. I have rated the highest because of the story line that outlines all other movies of this kind of movie genre. The roles define a human's emotions in the movie. The cast are a super gifted actors who have a knack for contributing their best to the movie. Script is just so marvelous. The purpose and the motive of an individual is superbly put in the movie. The hope that keeps you alive is nicely mentioned. The conversation are good to get you inspired and keep moving in life. Talks to the heart straight. I would recommend all movie lovers to watch this movie.	10
 Best Film of all Time	This movie is, in my opinion, the best movie of all time. I like it because the acting talent is exceptional, the screenplay is top notch and you really feel for it all. The visual effects are standard, but that is just fine. It doesn't make a difference either way. The plot is such that it makes you wonder whether or not he should be in the prison, as his attitude to everything seems unlike a murdering criminal. Tim Robbins proves his innocence well in the role, as well as his intelligence, spirit and also the fact that he can hide a hole in the wall for nearly 20 years. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, gives excellent narration and acts well, and is the start of the 'Morgan Freeman plays Morgan Freeman' trend. The rest of the acting cast is so believable you could've thought that it was made in the 1950s. What's more, you will be incredibly satisfied with the ending, as it is possibly the best-crafted ending in movie history.	10
 Hope is a good thing.	"Of a lifetime worth forty years- I never saw a movie that impressed me like this. You may not call it a perfect story but this movie just moves your soul...no wonder..it is the highly rated movie in IMDb. Two reasons why I loved this movie. Firstly the silence of Tim Robbins and the euphoria around Morgan Freeman. The scene on the terrace where Tim Robbins proves his mettle is a reminder of our latent abilities. This movie also reminds of survival instincts in real life wherein we should not lose hope when it comes to making choices. Two other movies that I loved in this perspective were ""Cast Away"" and ""Catch me if you can""!!! Not sure if they were all based on real life incidents but if you ever happen to live a life,make a movie,write a book... Do it this way!!! Amen!!!!"	10
 best of the best	I just want to say 1 thing about the amazing movie: after the movie was over; you must be nailed in place you sit! after i saw SH.R and it was over; i didn't feel the time and suddenly i saw the credits list was over and i was there with out moving for 5 min and just all thinking about the movie...if i want to describe the movie in a few sentences : The real meaning of freedom is in your heart; you can't find it in your side when your soul is unfamiliar with the concept of freedom and can't realized that actually the real fences are in your mind not in your side! if you want to watch 10 movie in your life >>> Shawshank Redemption is certainly one of them.	10
 Great movie	"If you were asked to name one actor capable of playing ex-cons, hit men, and God, you'd be hard pressed to do any better than Morgan Freeman -- which is, probably not coincidentally, why he's played all those characters (among many others) over the course of his distinguished, nearly 50-year career. And even as he reaches the half-century mark as a professional actor, Freeman shows no signs of slowing down. When it premiered on September 23, 1994, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" barely registered at the box office. The prison drama opened at No. 9, below the odious sex comedy ""Exit to Eden"" and just above Robert Redford's ""Quiz Show,"" already in its fifth week. Though nominated for seven Academy Awards, the film failed to connect with audiences and vanished from theaters with little fanfare. And then, slowly but surely, its fortunes began to change. On its 20th anniversary, here's how ""The Shawshank Redemption"" beat the odds and became a beloved classic."	10
 A moving story about prison which will change your life	This is a motivational story about a group of people in prison. It shows them going through many different conflicts. Most of the guards treat them badly and often abuse the inmates. The ugly realities of prison life are realized in the first half hour of the movie. There was strong acting on all parts. It was expertly shot too. It deserves all of the praise it has received. It's been near the top of IMDb's top 10 for years and it's showing no signs of slowing down. It's very moving and it has a lot of character development. It perfectly represents all the struggles that the characters go through. Also, the movie is highly brutal. Especially near the beginning. This isn't for anyone who doesn't like brutality but it's rather fitting in this movie. The way it combined brutality with a highly memorable story makes it something special. It touched me in a way that I cannot describe. Without any doubt, it's the best drama ever and one of the greatest movies of all time.	8
 Hope is a good thing and no good thing ever dies.		10
 Get busy watching this movie.	Truly a work of art.A great movie with a little bit of everything thrown in. Like The Green Mile (Which is also another brilliant prison movie & King adaptation) this has to be one of Stephen Kings best horror stories and pretty much one of the best prison films ever created. What could be more horrifying than being locked up for the rest of your life in a prison like Shawshank knowing you're innocent?With great acting by a top notch cast, a brilliant score, superb screenplay & direction by Frank Darabont and a simple message of hope, what's not to like?I highly recommend this movie. And if you haven't read the book yet then go out and buy it. It's pretty short but you'll be glad you did.	10
 Shawshank Redemption is incredible!	For years I kept hearing about this little movie called the Shawshank Redemption, I saw snippets satirized in shows like Family Guy. Finally I decided to sit down and watch it on Netflix a few weeks ago and I could not stop watching. I started watching the movie in the middle of the night and finished it as dawn was upon me. Intriguing from the very beginning, compelling to the end, truly a masterpiece of a movie. The acting is excellent on all front and it was nice to see some old familiar faces from the 90s that we don't get to see in films these days. I see now why this movie is now called a classic. Definitely a movie I would recommend.	10
 It was good.	"I don't know about best movie ever, but it was good. It had a good plot. Proper acting and actors. An abstract theme. It had a certain fascination. The writing was very good. Besides all those good things, to me it simply wasn't a movie that I would go around bragging about. I can see why people are head over heels about this movie, because it simple is one of those movies that leaves a mark in the mind of movie goers. To me it was one of those movies where it would leave you like ""wow, that was a pretty good and interesting movie"", but then you wouldn't watch it again for years. I first watched it almost a year ago and I haven't seen it again since. In my mind a great movie is one you can't get enough of, you just want to watch it over and over till you can't anymore, and I simply didn't get that from this movie. So my opinion is, it was good, but it wasn't great."	7
 Prison...who would have thought!	"Who would have thought that a prison film would become a cult classic? Slow and steady it goes. Worth every slow moment, in my opinion. A film about hope...and friendship. Something all of us can relate to. A spiritual journey that transcends time and space. You just soak up Tim's character...why is he so quiet? Did he kill them? Why Red? About Red. I believe that this is Morgan's best role ever. Tim also nails it, but Morgan stole the show. He portrays one who can get anything and pretty much runs the inside, and he plays it well. In my Top 10 for sure. One of the best movie quotes ever: ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'."""	9
 one of the best movie	I have never seen such an amazing film. the Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	10
 The most inspirational story ever	I saw Shawshank Redemption after seeing it in top 10 list of all rating sites. I must admit that it thoroughly deserved its top spot. Its a movie which intrigues you with its characters & events. The characters are build up interestingly.The movie just blows your mind when the suspense is revealed.Till that time i bet no one could ever guess that whats gonna happen next.The acting is superlative the dialogues are amazing.Its laid back style of unfolding of events is refreshing .The story is truly about hope triumphing in the grimmest of circumstances.The Must watch classic which is only comparable to the best of all times like Casablanca, Pulp Fiction, The Apartment.	10
 Perfect	It is a wonderful movie. No spoilers, but the characters are the best i have ever seen. Moving story, great written and acted, but There are a few that stand out, as you will notice. Nothing less then perfect. The movie is best when you come in with out a clue, so i am not going to say more. All you need to know is that it is a must watch. So turn off the lights crank the volume up and enjoy yourself. I can promise that you won't regret it. What are you doing still reading this, just turn it on and watch it. 10/10If you want a more indebted review read one of the other 3500+ reviews. I'am sure they will back my claims.	10
 Modern American Classic	This movies is almost perfect. Like many movies I would say it could be a tad shorter. Though that does add to truly feeling like Andy has been in prison as long as he has been. The music, the photography, the acting, the writing... it is all perfect. I don't know anyone who doesn't not like this film. I think it gets better with time. I want to buy this soundtrack I loved Thomas Newman's score so much. I think it is my favourite piece of his. Even the supporting characters in this film are fantastic. The guards, the other prisoners. All performances are 100% gripping. I can't even tell you how many times I have seen this film and try to enforce that anyone who hasn't start watching as soon as they can.	9
 Hope	"Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time. It is a must see. The Acting by the two protagonists are spectacular. The use of Music in this movie is genius. And the camera work gives hope to any aspiring film maker. It also gives hope to the entire cinema world. 1994 what a year for movies! I end with a quote ""he dispersed like a fart in the wind."""	10
 Excellent watch........more than once	Very well directed, scripted and acted movie. You may want to watch it more than once for getting to understand every scene of the movie. The way is handle hard situations without showing violence or graphic scenes is commendable.Stephen King shows how brilliant he can be besides horror movies, the story helps answer all the critics having any doubts about Stephen King as a writer. The characters shown are very realistic and emotions are not blown out of proportions. A must watch for every movie freak, a movie which you can show to both your friends and family without any hesitation	10
 10/10	I never wrote a review before, but I couldn't resist myself after watching this movie.The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. Morgan Freeman did a really good job on acting.... i love it. After all this years,I have been watched so many movies,but no one can compare with this greatest movie in the world in my mind! If you haven't seen this movie well you should watch it right now. It's worth it ! This movie is excellent in every way you look at it.This is a movie to be watched over and over. Each time I get a little bit more out of it. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life.	10
 movie the acting	"Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James . also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized""."	10
 Simply the best!!!	This film is simply the best story I have ever seen! Well, what to say, it is based on the story by Stephen King and it speaks for itself... I strongly recommend watching this film! :o) It already is a legend! When I saw it for the first time, I felt like grounded to the earth and I just couldn't stop watching it... And it was in the classroom, so usually it is the place you want to escape as fast as possible. :oD There are some moments that I just cant forget and also I am quite sure, it will stay in you as well... I wonder, when some film will break this one in quality and in the way it touches you. After the Green Mile, it is like nearly impossible task... I guess. Conclusion: If you love the story that will completely move with your feelings and will press you to feel very sad about characters and what happens to them... Well, this is the one you MUST watch.David	10
 a must watch movie!	a movie that gives you a different view of inmates in prison. it gives you a feel of satisfaction, and of true justice, and friendship.i've watched this movie at least 8 times, and enjoyed it every time i did.its a movie that makes you cry- only so you'll appreciate the moments where it makes you smile.i don't want to ruin this wonderful movie for the rest of you guys, but ill just say, its one of those movies, that you just love and remember forever.	10
 Shawshank, Best Movie so far		10
" ""Tonight, I Celebrate My Love"""	Tonight I celebrate my love for you It seems the natural thing to do Tonight no one's gonna find us We'll leave the world behind us When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And hope that deep inside you'll feel it too Tonight, our spirits will be climbing To a sky filled up with diamonds When I make love to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And that midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to you tonightTonight I celebrate my love for you And soon this old world will seem brand new Tonight we will both discover How friends turn into lovers When I make love to youTonight I celebrate my love for you And the midnight sun is gonna come shining through Tonight there'll be no distance between us What I want most to do is to get close to youTonight I celebrate my love for you Tonight	10
 Truly awesome	I would rate this as one of the best movies I've ever watched, unfortunately, at home. Great story, great characters, lots of feelings and emotions.I remember to feel anxious about the escape, to feel the pain and happiness transmitted by each moment in the movie.Decades waiting for a release that would never come, and after so much time having the guts to try a jail break and find some comfort outside, in a world which wasn't exactly the same left behind.A must watch, without hesitation, even if only one time in your life. A lesson to everyone's life, don't give up, even when there is not too much hope in the horizon.	9
 Yes, Shawshank is as good as you've heard		10
 Must Watch!	The Shawshank Redemption is truly one of the best movies ever made. With picture perfect performances all around. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies you can watch and re-watch and re-watch and love it each time. The sad part is it didn't get the fame and Oscars it deserved.7 Oscar Nominations and no wins does not do justice to the quality of this movie.The Shawshank Redemption is a must buy and keep to watch again and again. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters as Andy Dufresne and Red respectively, take them to a whole new level, which in-turn suck the viewer into their world of highs and lows.If this movie isn't a part of your collection already get it now.	10
 This is an amazing film.	"I was 16 when I first saw this movie. I had just gotten a car and was in that high school phase where I argued with my parents about everything. I was ready to leave my house and drive to a friends when my parents told me I had to stay home because it was already getting late on a school night. Naturally, that angered me, but my dad had a suggestion. ""Watch The Shawshank Redemption with us. I think you'll really like it."" I'm still quite grumpy so I respond, ""What's it about?"" ""The story of how two men bond as they spend years in prison together."" After hearing that, I had absolutely no intention on watching it, as it sounded incredibly boring. We argued a bit more and he finally got my stubborn teenage self to sit on the couch and watch it. And I was blown away. This film immediately became my favorite of all time, and I had to have watched it with many of my friends over the following months. This is a film that really opens your eyes on the important things in life. It's extremely well made, very entertaining and incredibly inspirational. I highly suggest you take the time to watch this masterpiece."	10
 Fantastic Film	Have to say i have watched this movie over the years probably 15 times or more and it never gets old or boring. Great prison film with some good meaningful acting and some fun also along the way. The acting from all of the cast is great and some stand out a bit more than others. There is some violence in there and some that may be a little upsetting to some people who like light hearted TV but some parts of this film really do take it a bit further than your boring films with no decent plot. The plot is well thought out and provides some interesting twists and turns that will keep you glued to your seat and waiting for more action. Watch the first 15 minutes and you will be hookedGed	10
 Best Film Ever, Really?	Let me get this straight, when I first watched this film I loved it. However when I first watched this film, I was thirteen, and agreed with everything I read. I thought the film was too long, with too much fat, and solemn fat at that. I thought Tim Robbins does a good job, and plays the role how he ought to, but the role still doesn't set my world alight. I'm not a Morgan Freeman fan, that's just me personally. I thought this was one of his more believable roles, before he became a parody of himself. The worst thing about this film is the script, and I feel it thrives in moments of silence. I enjoyed the playing of the record, I thought Brooks hanging himself was excellently done, I thought the rape scene was nasty but not too gruelling. These scenes were well judged, because this film could have so easily fallen into torrid and depressing territory, and it does do that a little bit. I felt the iconic moments of wisdom, are really not so clever. To me they sound like quotes written on a page, and scattered throughout.Overall I think it is a very good film. This is me really reviewing with reference how the average person views the film. What I'm trying to say is that this is not close to best film of all time material. It does nothing groundbreaking or exceptional in terms of filming, or storytelling, or performance or anything. If you watch the film as a whole it's pretty good but not fantastic, if you look at it in bits, some bits are fantastic, others are pretty poor. There's no way I can look at this film an even compare it to Citizen Kane, or Psycho, or Birth of a Nation. It is not on that level of film making.Eight out of Ten.	7
 one of the best movies of all time	The Shawshank Redemption is the movie that is always discussed when talking about the all time greatest movies. It's just one of those movies that how it's told is better than the idea of it. With flawless directing, acting, casting, and dialog, it's sure to one of the all time greats. The movie teaches you that living is when hope over comes darkness.It amazes me that one of the most cheerful and hopeful movies takes place inside a prison. It is captivating to watch a man, presented with such injustice, fight to make a difference within the walls.Re-watched this classic. The importance of hope, friendship and perseverance of the human spirit in Andy's character is ever inspiring.10/10	10
 One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Unforgettable Masterpiece.		10
 A simple work of art and a mind blowing drama.		10
 Best movie of all time	Best movie of all time? Maybe a overstatement. Or maybe not? You should watch the movie and decide for yourself. Im pretty sure this movie wont let you down, and you will see what all the hype is about. My friends had to talk me in to see this movie, but I very grateful to them that they did. This is the best movie I've seen in all my life. Good plot. Excellent characters. Very good actors, you really get in touch with the characters. Tim Robbins, surprises me in this movie. Morgan Freeman, huge fan of him.You should really just rent the movie, sit down, and enjoy this 2 hour long movie. You will never regret it.And yes, it is as good as everyone says it is :) Enjoy!	10
 The Greatest movie ever created !!!﻿	"This movie was made in 1994. And watching this now in 2014, after 20 years, I must say that this movie is beautiful. Thumbs up!!﻿a man in a prison , his wife has ""another lover"" and the court said that he killed them, he said he didn't do it but the truth no one really knows. He has a life of a prisoner, and then after years, he escaped successfully...The best part of the whole plot is that you don't even realize and the man plans is escape so well from inside the prison. Watch it till the end to enjoy.everything about this movie is great. And, there's a reason for this movie to be No.1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. I have no more words to explain the awesomeness of this movie. Highly recommend this!﻿"	10
 The Best of the Best	Hi guys,This is the best of the best and it is total 100% deserve to place on top 1.each and every frame of this movie is perfect, specially the character of a hero and red, this movie is based on a novel and really we don;t know where it came from all we need a good movie and i found that, this is my all time best movie ever.life gives you the worst situations but one day is yours, get ready for worst and you will get a good day too.loved it.....,	9
 Great movie, worth your time.	This had been a movie that anyone should see. Great story, great actors and a great plot to an overwhelmingly interesting story line. There is a reason this is the best film on IMDb. It develops very nicely and you can see a great deal or work put into this movie. Each character has his own personality that you get accustomed to throughput the movie. Every aspect and detail is covered very precisely and you are right on the plot through the whole movie. Don't mind the age of the movie, usually the older the better. If you love great movies, don't miss this one, it's a once in a life time watch. There is nothing missing throughout the whole movie, and the story is just so great.	10
 What if?	What if the tunnel was blocked at the end and so he ended up trapped there? I guess he could have crawled backwards and up out the pipe again, but still horrible to think about. This film is so popular because the pipe symbolizes your working life and the beach scene at the end is the escape from working life. Its not about prison, its about the 9 to 5.Everyone wants to do an Andy Dufresne.Also, he'd escaped his marriage and gets to live out his life having fun on the beach playing around a boat with his pal and that is presented as the definition of Paradise, maybe it is, but you know it'd probably get old after a couple of days.	10
 Just Perfect	"This film will forever remain one of my favorite films of all time. The brilliantly written story, the excellent film work and one of the best casts I've ever watched. The way this film is directed, keeps the viewer interested the whole way through while not straining the story, which is a perfect piece of direction in my opinion. The characters in the film are so strong that you actually feel emotional at different points. The setting is also very believable and adds to the story very well. I love the way this film makes me feel nostalgic to a time when I wasn't even born, similarly to ""Stand By Me"". If you've ever wanted to watch a great piece of film, then watch this. I would recommend this film to anyone."	10
 good	good good good good film was good. 11/10 This film was a classic a classic film about escape and escape is what the film is about. 10/10 for effort. 10/10 for film filming. 10/10 for scenes. 10/10 for effort acting. It is a great film and ranked high on here so that it is the best cheers thanks for reading it.How can this require 10 lines of review when it was just a good movie that i liked and really haven't got much more to say really but you should watch it because it is good. If you have seen this film and you like my review please give it a 10/10 likes and tell all your friends about this movie and movie review so they can become famous. If i could include pictures about this film i would show a picture of fort boyard that is like this film but in real life and on TV.	9
 great movie	excellent movie to watch.It tells us the struggle of an innocent man in jail. I watched this movie and was bewildered by its script as well as acting of the Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins , these two guys are legends hats off to there performance . the movie was so interesting that I watched it over 5 times , as my schedule is so hectic and busy I still watched it over n over again,considering the fact it is the best movie on IMDb.the ratings justify the movie. All I want many of users and browsers of IMDb to watch this movie and you will never forget the awesomeness of this movie.Its a must watch movie just give it a try, u will love it I am sure of it. BIG THANKS TO IMDb TO PROVIDE THERE GREAT INTERFACE TO REGULAR BROWSING PEOPLE AND HELP THEM FINDING AMAZING MOVIES	10
 A masterpiece about freedom	Never a film had given such a direct meaning to freedom, not a physical freedom but the one that dwells in the human soul. With this masterpiece seems the director, Frank Darabont, wants to prove Seneca's thesis. Seneca, in fact, argued that a man can be free on the throne or in chains. Though the role was firstly offered to other actors (Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks and Brad Pitt), Tim Robbins's Dufresne is extraordinarily expressive. The script is well adapted from the Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, and though Red was supposed to be Irish I forgive Darabont because he gave to the whole world the opportunity to see an amazing Morgan Freeman. I'm actually disappointed this film didn't won any of the seven Academy Awards nomination received (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing).	10
 Intriguing, interesting , keeps you involved . A must watch.	The manner of story presentation is very impressive , the way main plot is valiantly attempted to be kept away from the attention and keep minor sub-plots going surprises the viewer towards the end . It shows the virtue of patience in success full completion of any task. Apart from that content was precise , no junk songs or scenes to dilute the experience of viewer. Overall quite compact , direct , and point to point method of story telling . Although in terms of marketing , there might have been concerns of the movie not appearing to be appealing enough to the viewing audience but who so ever gave it a go , would have been delighted this excellent masterpiece. So I strongly recommend everyone to go and watch it for sure.	8
 Truly enjoyed this King story translated into a film	Awesome film! The ending is the pay-off! If you enjoy films like King stories like the 'Green Mile' you're going to enjoy this! The film is a period piece, so though I've only just recently watched it, and noted the date it was made- it doesn't even matter. The characters are real, and the settings are very authentic. There were only a couple of things I can honestly say I didn't like. One of them was how prison life seemed to be portrayed. I think it was a lot worse than what was shown. I also disliked how 'all-powerful' the warden was. It was heartbreaking when he had the character of Tommy Williams killed off. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were fantastic!	8
 Great Movie	I never wrote a review before, but I couldn't resist myself after watching this movie, no doubt one of the best movie I have watched.I Had this movie with me from a long time, but never was interested to watch it. and then couple of times tried to watch it but every time it was less than 30 Min. and then one of my frnd told me about this movie he saw and I was so impressed with the story and screenplay. on the same night I watched it and its amazing.everyone who wants to be thrilled or amazed pls watch this movie. I would not like to discuss the story because that ruins your pleasure of watching this movie. but I can assure you that watching this movie will amaze you.	10
 Greatest movie i ever saw		9
 Stephen King wrote an amazing story; Frank Darabont did it justice.		10
 Értékelésem	I think a movie is unconscious and is still the best and I everyone i can.Nagyon offer thought-provoking throughout story.Really live problem is that if you spend too much time institution will depend on him and do not find yourself later world. Morgan Freed also extremely well suited to the role , for me, the One of the best actors I've ever even particularly like the I knew.Ami the time in which it takes place throughout this period in particular, like him.This film is a perfect example of how you can be the epitome of a good story to make.If I could I would go back to this era and very happy to be living in it , is quite close to my heart.	10
 Loved the movie...	Movie is full of emotion, human sentiments.. best movie ever. The way movie plot unfolds. It is really amazing to see. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	10
 Powerful	"First, I read Stephen King's ""Different Seasons"" as soon as it came out (I was around 19 I guess), and was enthralled by his writing. Of course, I had no idea 3 out of the 4 novellas would eventually adapted into movies, but I am not surprised. It is impossible to put whatever pictures you have in your mind onto the screen, so that is why everyone compares the book to the movie. The same happened to me with ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" (HIGHLY recommend reading the book), even with Bogie playing, it was a tough transition to see it on the screen. I assume at least 80-90% of those who saw either one never read the books. ANYway...the Shawshank Redemption was very ""full"" of character development, and amazing passion from Morgan Freeman especially. He is an expert in his craft, and for me, his peak. I will be watching this soon again with my wife who has not seen many American films."	8
 The Shawshank Redemption	"Shawshank is a emotionally diverse and wonderful story of friendship that takes place in a harsh, rough prison setting. The acting in this movie was superb! It easily has to be one of the top movies made in the last few decades. Morgan Freeman was outstanding as ""Red"" a jail broker, who knew how to get what anyone needed. Tim Robbins as ""Andy"", a like able banker from the city, who was wrongly convicted of murdering his wife. He gets sentenced to Shawshank prison. Andy and Red begin to take you on a story involving many different emotions regarding life in prison and the relationships that are formed and develop. The various events that they occur during their time in prison kept me engaged throughout this long movie. This movie left me satisfied and fulfilled as a movie goer. I hope Hollywood can use this film as a template to make more movies of this quality again. I would highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't had the pleasure of seeing it!"	9
 V good move	He Shawshank Redemption is in a league with Casablanca as a movie you can watch over and over, catching different nuances each time and bringing your own life experiences each time you watch it. Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman should have won an Oscar (a shame he had to wait for Million Dollar Baby.) There are many twists and turns and I defy anyone to watch the ending without tears running down their face. In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a shade too long, meaning it's often butchered when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to get the full thrust of it. Definitely on my personal top 10	8
 The greatest film of all time!	Great movie! With a great sense! Everyone needs to see it at least once in your life! Tim Robbins played great, as well as Morgan Freeman! William Sadler was also on top! I love this movie! Each replica in this film contains a deep meaning! Which makes you wonder about many things! All the same, not all of the film adaptation of Stephen King's books are terrible! There are exceptions! And this movie in this number! Directing excellent! Here we can not speak bad! This profile is one of the best that I saw in my entire life! Of films in the world is very small! If everyone in this film was such as this, the crime would not be in our world!	10
 As good as it gets!	I must say i am really impressed!I watched the trailer and wasn't really intrigued by it, however watching the movie itself turned that around completely. Most trailers turn out better than the movie itself but this film is the complete opposite.Adapted from a Stephen King novel, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, i could already tell this was going to be great. Even though the story does reach its climax at a slow pace i would say that it is definitely worth the watch.I would recommend a nice cup of coffee to warm your inners, but in this case, the film already does that.	10
 Shawshank amazing redemption		10
 the best movie	"My life is forever changed due to this movie. It is a movie of hope, ""redemption"", and friendship. It shows a deep growing friendship between two prisoners, Andy and Red. They each are shown growing through their distinct hardships at Shawshank prison. As time passes, hope wanes but a flame burns bright in Andy. His hope and unrelentless nature carry over to his friend Red.As Red's long stay in prison comes to an end he sees the light at the end of the tunnel. Andy has left it for him to see the way to freedom, and he follows it.This film parallels my life and leaves me wondering if my advice will help somebody see the light. For some of those people time will tell. As for now I'll be patient to wait and see. Don't end up like Brooks, there will always be someone to help you out. There is someone out there that cares for you. Thank you Andy Dufresne, your hope is the flame of my life."	10

 Wonderful movie.		9
 Pure perfection	The best movie I have ever seen. The bond among the two main characters is absolutely astonishing throughout the whole movie. Although the film is old (20 years from now) the script is amazingly well written and ordered. The most shocking is that this story might happen to anyone. After the end of the movie I was with mixed feelings. This is a movie with lot of thought-provoking messages like these for friendship, loyalty, strength of character and never giving up on your dreams. I liked it very much because the main character has so many qualities that describe my personality. Creations like this are real masterpiece to the cinema at all.	10
 What i felt ...	I guess s. redemption is the simplest most reliable movie that can be watched with great expectation ... yeah ... good movie ..... glad it got to be no 1 on the list ... not that just because its mainstream ... it has one of the best endings a movie can have ... well i was hoping one of Christopher Nolans movie would be no 1 but .. hey this movie deserves it .. and em .... well .. so sad to know that it didn't get any Oscars ... thats a bummer .. well the actors are great the story is good and the direction is even better a movie that ill never forget even if i get an amnesia or something .. well even though ill never let that happen .. i guess .word .	10
 Awesome Movie	"One Of the Best Movie Ever Made.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	9
 Awesome Movie i have ever seen	I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue. An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.	10
 Great movie	I like this movie, it's one of my favorites. Not to flashy with all the special effects they use nowadays but still keeps your attention. The sometimes unexpected turns in the story are nice as is the friendship between inmates. Roles well played. A story well told. Its not good enough for the best movie ever but it's definitely one of the best. The acting is solid. The details are correct. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is played well from the beginning until the end it is still the same character. No unrealistic changes. Freeman, who is simply a great actor. This is one of his best works. I'd love to see him play like this again because what he does nowadays is mediocre. I like the references made to other stories like the count of Monte Cristo.	10
 A simple review from not a film critic or professional.	This movie has some very good acting from several cinema stars and has a great plot about a man that has things turn out wrong for him because of the problems in society. My advice would be to watch the film and decide for yourself if you like it or not. I don't know what to really say about it besides the fact that a person should at least see this movie once in their lifetime. Society has changed in a lot of ways and one way is described in this film by showing just how racist and corrupt the government as well as the people of this time period. That time period being the 1950's I'm guessing because it's been awhile since I saw this film. Can't say that I am really giving away spoilers because I am simply writing that I enjoyed the film but also don't want IMDb to block my account again.	8
 very silently, but the unexpected	Shawshank Redemption is another great movie. This movie is telling about the Andy Dufresne's life, performed by Tim Robbins. He is a young banker who has a high opportunity in his job, then his life is turning into the dark, he has to move into a jail just because the court judged that he killed his wife and adulterer while he did not do anything. This point shows me about gap in the law and how the justice court becomes unfair, it's like a reflection of the reality and i do like it. However, the story is told by Red, Morgan Freeman, a close friend of Andy while he was in a prison, it broadcasts every single things in prison, such like right, equality, freedom, and corruption. That's why the movie can persuade the audiences to believe that Andy was really wrong. The story is telling very silently, but the unexpected situation is coming up continuously.It does not make me surprise when I heard that Shawshank got many awards, even many people said that Forrest Gump is better than it and got the rewards more. In my opinion, I think it is because Shawshank is hard for understanding sometimes and the audiences did not get it. It's like this movie is telling by the third party and it was just a new style of a movie at that time. Deeply, It is amazing for me because I cannot guess what is the truth, what is not.	9
 the remarkable movie	The Shawshank Redemption is written by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, this two men also produced the film named 'the green mile'. This film is about one young and successful man who works in bank named 'Andy Dufresne who is convicted by court that he murdered his wife and her lover. This made him has to get in the jail named Shawshank, which has many friendship, injustice, ferocity, and hope. With the good storytelling make this film isn't that boring although it's a long movie but we all forget the time while watch it. This story show many sides of the society, show the part of prisoners that do not get the acceptance from the society, show the part of many richer who has power but corruption the society. The injustice between people and prisoners make this film is interesting. With the good a casting, story telling, edited, sound technical and many things make is film is perfect. As you know that this film is the best movie on IMDb and I also guarantee that this movie will make you impress.	9
 Representation of world	I just said 'representation of world', because actually it is ! The shawshank redemption showed how world is cruel and cannot be forecasted, by using limited area and place with specific characters. It is quite old film but, still can be explained this era. I tried to watch this film as 2 kinds of views. First, I saw the shawshank jail represent as the human society. In limited place, people really want to make their own 'laws and rules' for them. Sometimes, it looks like nonsense nor illogical but, we;I mean human did actually and.. In this society, there is invisible hierarchy also. Secondly, This film showed how people are survive with their own way in society. Some people do not understand the change, and also some other people are against the laws and rules, such as Andy. Especially, Brooks who kill himself showed the people who do not accept the change their environment. I can see myself, which kind of people am I? This film tells us many things, not only these. When time after time, it will be showed different way, so sure.	9
 Review		10
 The best authentic screenplay!	The best Hollywood movie I've ever seen. The screenplay, the background score, the story line is epic and original. I just wish there is a Shawshank redemption 2. Morgan freeman's acting is one of the best as a supporting actor. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle.	10
 my opinion	"Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: ""Maybe it's because I'm Irish."".On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalization, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy.Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalization with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback. Instead, Darabont allows the film to unfold at a gentle, gradual pace, reflecting the mind-set of the characters. They don't realize how trapped they are until it's too late, just as we don't realize that two-and-a-half hours has passed until the credits have begun to roll.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling gormless in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it ""a poster child for Christianity"". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic).The Shawshank Redemption may not be entirely worthy of its number one ranking on IMDb, but it remains a really terrific piece of drama let down only by its final scene. In every other aspect it's a masterpiece, as a character piece, a treatise on hope and a beautifully paced and mounted Stephen King adaptation. It remains a must-see for all film fans of penchant or persuasion, earning its status as a modern classic and securing a warm place in our hearts."	10
 Awesome Movie	Great Movie had excellent characters in the film. I thought it was well made and had symbolism. There were lots of points and details about the script that made the movie arc. The filmography was excellent and captured every moment to be real. This movie can take you on a trip and also to have a self discovery. Some people can relate to the tragedies and struggles in the movie. The movie was clear and made its point. I feel that this movie had important roles that portray the character's individuality. I recommend this movie to anyone who'd like to watch a meaningful story. The actor's really caught in the moment and living in the moment was interesting.	8
" ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" - Andy Dufresne"	"This work from 1994 directed and written by a Hungarian-American Frank Darabont that was based on Stephen King's novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption was nominated for several highly appreciated awards, including The Academy Awards and The Golden Globe Awards. In spite of being nominated for so many prestigious prizes, it did not win any. However, this fact cannot put a shadow over the fantastic job that was done while making the movie. Critics from all over the world were absolutely amazed by the drama with outstanding and unbelievably realistic scenery. It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the main protagonists – experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will provide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes a friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis ""Red"" Redding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small stone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he overhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes. Thanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the library so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years pass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works worked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can receive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an irredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red and when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his former inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed two people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's innocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he has young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He tells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village and instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day, Andy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy escaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as Randall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the laundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what has happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and the newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch the bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the best judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion and how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of ones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating skills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply settled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story. I haven't seen such a well-thought-out plot like this in a long time. The diligent work of the producers, cameramen, costume designers, make-up and hair stylists and all of the crew will be remembered. I can't write this without mentioning the set. I have already talked about it, but I need to praise it a little bit more. It was so easy to get into the plot thanks to the set – you do not get a chance to doubt the realism of the scenery. Another aspect to be spotlighted is the soundtrack. Magnificent Thomas Newman and his team produced a piece of quality material which does not stay unnoticed and bonds you even more with the whole drama. Last but not least, I must applaud the directing and screen writing of Mr. Darabont who created a completely unique and new experience for TV viewers and cinema audiences. We can only guess what happens in the end until we finally get to see the finish line of Shawshank. I guarantee you will end up with a wide smile on your face.To sum up, we can only thank the entire crew for the spectacular project with an inspiring story of not giving up. The conclusion of my review is as brief as it can be – go and book your place in front of the big screen! You will not regret it. The massive number of emotions you can experience while watching The Shawshank Redemption will make you laugh or cry whenever you want."	9
 A Beautifully Portrayed Saga of Life		10
 Changed My World	This movies is the first movie I watch that actually showed me that movies can be so much more then just entertainment. Though I was always a movie lover, and I never knew why, this movie showed me how great movies can be. It really taught me to read into movies more and that, like music, there are some great ones that will stand the test of time. This movie showed me to give all movies a chance and made me start watching some old ones that I never would have before.The acting is solid, the story is clear and easily understood. The writing is wonderful. The editing is seamless. And finally the overall quality of everything in this movie will stand the test of time no matter how many re-masters we get, and I hope we get a lot of them.Great movie and I believe anyone can enjoy it at any time.	10
 Amazing film	The Shawshank Redemption actually an outstanding film that come up with a story of dealing with prisons as seen by several prisoner. In the movie show many social problems, which are all discussed in the movie. Also it has a emotionally attached at the end of the film it almost make me cry out. This movie can capture and identify with American male spirit as it shows in movie. The movie actually talking about the development of friendship between Red and Andy is charming and appealing. For this movie is consisting of a beautiful personal film fantastic acting well crafted story, great scenes, great characters and awesome plot, which make this movie turn out this good. It's the most touching and heart warming film of human spirit that I have seen and it might be a great movie to watch with family and be one of the best movies of all time. This film truly is a masterpiece. If you miss this film you will be missing out one of the finest film.	8
 The Shawshank Redemption	"""When the world is not that kind of beautiful. Injustice is the only thing that exist."" It's from the wrote of Stephen King and arranged by Frank Darapont, the very good director, although they can't get so much view but people said it's kind of the best film.They tell the story to Andy Dufresne, the banker who was sentenced to be in prison because of killed his wife. So, he was in jail at Shawshank. He had to bear with wickedness everyday.It's kind of normal movie that is just a good man in the prison that everything is very frightful. But this movie can make us concentrated without anything to complain."	9
 Must watch Movie	One of the finest movie ever I have watched. Whenever I get depressed, I watch this movie again and again. Salute to all actors and director of this movie. I am really fortunate to got chance to watch such very good movie. The way movie photographed is excellent. Background music is also soulful. Story and screenplay amazing. Everybody must watch this movie in their life time at least for once. Life in jail is hell and how jailer and his guards abuses the system is canvased in detailed. Hats off to producer too. I have seen movie in English and dubbed in Hindi too. I will rate this movie as greatest. Never say die and killing instinct the movie resembled.	10
 Great Technique	I think everyone who saw this movie will like it. If you are director or director photography, this is the best technique of camera shot. It looks like a easy shot but it will be great. Some shot in this movie i think it will use after effects for making that shot but in that time i think adobe just was born. Thus the director of this movie is intelligent. He can make a lot of technique in that time but some shot has a mistake. We will can observe some shot is not real or unusual. I think overall are great. I copy some technique to improve my film too. The actors of movie are smart. They make the audience believe with their acting. I love it too much.	9
 Good	The Shawshank Redemtion is just the story of a con man. Who have been jailed for longevity of life. The film presents the story of a prisoner at a depth of virtual audience participation events in the prison is always violent profanity.Even the corrupt warden of a prison or more. It is known that this film exposes different aspects. Of people in prison are dimensional and interesting.But this is still not the main point of the film to be presented. But this is just a simulation and scenario-wise. The core idea is to allow the audience to bark, then pick it up as inspiration for their own.	
 Simple characters but complicate story.	Simple but complicate. This movie is great movie in element of the story telling. I haven't known the plot before; I thought It was a regular movie but it wasn't. It is one of the best movie that I ever seen. Frank Darabont did a great job and he has directed clearly story. He makes every character in the movie become important in the movie. Firstly, I thought Anny was tried to survive in the prison day by day. Red he was a leader of the prisoner. At first I thought he would have a conflict with Anny because He imported things from outside the prison to sold in prison to make a profit for himself. Anny always asked for different thing from other prisoners with him. But truly he had a coolest plan for getting out of prison. The story was complicated but story was telling smoothie because he had plan to escape from the prison. He made the warden trust him by working for him. The warden used him to did his dirty work even he had destroyed the last evidence that Anny wasn't guilt. Finally, Anny payback by a very cleaver plan. So, If you are the fan of prison brake movie. You must watch.	10
 Ride to the redemption	Tim Robbins is very good at what he does. So is the evergreen Morgan Freeman. I have always been a fan of Morgan freeman. But I saw this movie recently. It has inclined Mr Freemans position in my heart. Acting is mind blowing, with the perfect combination of screenplay and direction the movie has emerged as something miraculously beautiful. Movie sticks to its plot so nicely that there ain't a moment when you go astray. Dialogue are so heart striking you feel every single dialogue since you are embedded in the story as characters itself. There are a few goofs in the movie, but considering the fact that the movie has gone beyond the definitions of a good cinema we can leave those for good. I am literally asking every cinema lover to watch this to their hearts content.	10
 Best movie of all time.	This is the best film I've ever seen. The shawshank redemption was shown important things in our life that are freedom and friendship. Even in the prison, prisoner need to have any friendship. This story was told by Red's point of view. Red is a friend of the main character. You will never know the main character thinking about. The way to tell story was great which is to show defectiveness of social, justic system, and corruption but the main character can handle his problem very well. Another thing is the main character was a good man even he went to the prison he did not change himself to be bad. He still doing a good things for other people. Finally, this movie teach me which is a freedom is very beautiful and worth to wait because everyone want to have a freedom that's why this movie is the best movie for everybody.	
 one of the best movie i ever watched in my life.	The movie is amazing.First let me begin with the theme of the movie. The theme and the concept of the movie is quit predictable because before watching i know that it is a movie about a main character try to break out the the prison and i am quit sure that at the end the main character will succeed and it is definitely like what i thought. but what make this movie great are what is in the movie. All the detail that are given and toward the running of the story line that make it is unpredictable for me of what going to happen next even though i already know that he will break out of the prison successfully.The setting of the movie is not much special because most of the time it is in the prison so not much to talk about, but it is still great that we as a viewer got the see how a real prison look like a how does it really feel as we follow the main character throughout the whole movie.The lighting of the movie is pretty dark and giving a sad and hopeless feeling to us viewer so it is great that we get to feel what the characters feel too.This movie gave me a point of view of a people who is in a prison for to long and don't have a clue of what they will do if they ever got a chance to come out again or not. This movie contain many emotion feeling of the character and really done well on delivering it to us viewing.The casting of the movie is amazing all the character and the actor really look believable like they are who they are.After watched the movie, it gave me so many thing to think about and how hard and how corrupt the world is today, even though the world we live on now is on the different era but there will always be a bad man, and it will never change. We just need to do what is right and continue doing it.	8
 one of movies that you must watch it	It is reasonable that it is rank in top 5 of best movies . It has a very good story. This is a worked of Frank Darabont, he also the director of green mile. For the message that they said is very clearly and good in every parts. All scenes and characters is very important. It makes emotional to audience. this movie makes people understand more about the life of prisoners. Some scene is gonna makes audience cry. this movie also teaching people such as , patient , Friendship and etc. Moreover, it looks the realistic in prison. I love the end of the story that show the another side of Red that he has very important role in prison ,but he is not important and invaluable in normal life. It shows a part of life. I love it.	10
 Miracle on screen	No words that i can think of even comes close of how amazing this movie really is. its funny, thrilling and bone chilling. what i really love about this movie is that you really feel for the characters as if they were family. when Brooke's committed suicide I was holding on a pillow shouting. It has it moment, and the greatest flaw of this movie in my opinion is pacing. The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.Adding to the slow pacing, Andy acting is neutral is bare shows emotion. Which is charming in a way, because Straight face can magically immerse you in a weird way. Neo from the Matrix series for instance. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. I feel like the fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.In one word, a masterpiece Have come at the wrong time. Nevertheless, still an unforgettable movie. The story will take in. Great movie with fantastic performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins..This kind of movie will get you off the hook at first, But it's an acquired taste that you will receive half way through.	10
 Tearjerking human drama	"I watch this movie because this is in one of my assignments from university and professor who is teaching about movie told me to watch, and this is movie is always in top of movie raking. Almost all people who watched The Shawshank Redemption said this movie is good, and considered as the best movie all the time, so I watched it.The story is about a man who named Andy Dufresne, a banker is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in the state of Maine. He befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Spend over 20 years of his life in Shawshank prison and finally he was able to escape from Shawshank prison.I think this movie is interesting enough that always on top in movie ranking. I like this kind of drama movie and it is tear jerking story. Personally I do not like the movie has too much violence, shouting, or yelling. In the beginning I was bored and do not want to continue to watch because there was a scene that Hadley and other prison guards punch and kick until a new prisoner die. Also there are so many scenes that similar to this scene. Those things are what I do not like. Over all, I like this movie."	9
 brilliant !!	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie involving story about life in prison that represents through crimes, bribery, sexual harassment, and drama. This movie was simple but it delivers meaningful messages in all characters' performance especially in the scene when their eyes contact. This film contains emotional impact about true friendship and hope. Brief the plot: Andy, a successful banker, was accused of murdering his wife and her affair. He was sentenced to Shawshank Prison for that. Later in prison, Andy helped one of the prison guards to evade taxes. In return, the prison guard gave Andy and Red, his best friend in Prison, some cold beer. From this cause, Andy became a popular guy in the prison and made a lot of friends. After several years of slowly piercing through the wall using some kind of art equipment, Andy finally broke out of prison. A couple of years later, Red was released out of Shawshank Prison. He came to meet Andy at the beach that Andy told him to meet up when he get released. The highlight of this movie is when Andy used his specialty in evading taxes to make the wardens trust him. The biggest surprise for me is when Andy asked the warden for rope, most of the people who watch will predict that he will commit suicide but the truth is, he used to it tight things up and escape from the prison. In conclusion, the acting in this movie is very good, the storytelling is amazing, exciting and brilliant, and production is quite simply. This movie is very amazing because it teaches me that people must always have hope to move on in their life.	9
 excellent	While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.	10
 One of the best movies ever made !	When I first saw this film I wasn't expecting a lot to be honest .

Every scene is presented perfectly and it has so many iconic moments enough for 10 movies . It is deeply emotional It has great actors . Philosophic thoughts . Everything that a great movies needs. Recommended to everybody who is interested in watching proper movies and are not afraid of spending some time on a single movie. Everybody should have seen it anyways .

 Never Give up Hope		10
 Greatest Movie of All Time	This movie will change your life! From the soundtrack, to the acting, to the story line it is amazing all the way through. Morgan Freeman narrating, it just doesn't get better than that kids. The characters pull you in and you will be engrossed in the story before you know it. Tim Robbins has a performance of a lifetime. Honestly, I believe it is a crying shame that this movie didn't win any Oscars. That is because it came out the same year as Forrest Gump and people were in awe because they had never seen anything done like Forrest Gump before. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is amazing and Forrest Gump was great, but if you are looking for the true best picture of 1994 grab some popcorn, and look no further than Shawshank Redemption. If you don't believe me look at what movie sits on top of the IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time list year in and year out.	10
" it was a requirement to watch a film called ""The Shawshank Redemption""."		10
 Never Gets Old	Every time this film comes on the TV I end up watching it all the way through. Even if it's on till 2am and I have got to be up early for work I stay up and watch it all the way through. I don't know what it is about it. Possibly Morgan Freeman voice hypnotising me. Or maybe I just enjoy it. Saying that though Green Mile does the same thing to me and Morgan Freemans not in that. I'd say I have seen this film more time than the name Andy Dufrey is said throughout the film. All in all a superb film and if you have not seen it yet, i'd like to know how you haven't with the countless amount of times it's been on the TV. Give it a watch and fall into the trap I am stuck in. (In a good way)	7
 The Shawshank Redemption - An Epic		9
 the best and the most charming movie	Part of that probably comes from the concept of tolerance, hope to bring freedom. It was answered clearly for Andy who does not make mistakes But patience to stay inside jail Doing what he loves, offering hope, goodness and kindness to others. (Proposed channels of tax evasion for the atrocities against their jailers, like beer, colleagues, by himself, does not touch alcohol, etc.) say it is my view that the Andy is in jail without fault. But he did not complain much. Not revenge Not rampant, but Andy use his intelligence and fortitude to fight. Finally, the truth and the good that makes this movie is all about	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Great movie		8
 The Shawshank	"The Shawshank Redemption"" is adapted by Frank Darabont from the novella ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. There have been many adaptations of King's works but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" outshines them all. Why? Because it is nothing short of outstanding. I can't speak for everybody, but this is a film that I can watch over and over again, and love it more each time I watch it. And, while I simply talked about the ending this entire review, that is not all that makes this film incredible. However, I will not waste any more of your time talking about how wonderful this film is. And please do not waste any of your own time. Find a way to see this movie as ASAP. It will be time well spent, and you will certainly see it multiple more times."	10
 Awesome	One of the best movie and great performance by Tim and Morgan. Classic in all aspects. Remains in memory for long time after you have watched. Every time you watch gives you same level of joy and excitement. This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, it gets more exciting here.Interestingly, it is not King's horror film, rather a good odd friendship, hope, and freedom with amazing twist and turns. Great films stir emotions. They have an impact that lasts long beyond the trip to the cinema. They give you an opportunity to reflect on your life, to ponder on the moments and they can inspire. It's a story about 2 men, in prison in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and what happens to them. Simply but amazing,	8
 message	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialog of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialog does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialog. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much- needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	10
 No wonder why it on the top list		10
 One of the films that you must see (MUST SEE)	A film that you will never forget There are just too many words to explain about this film. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins relationship in the film is a major part of the film as well as surviving shawshank with everything it has to offer. A must see film and is something you cannot turn down. From the acting to the directing to it's amazing story of a man who is accused of murdering his wife and is put into shawshank prison were he meets red (Morgan Freeman) before getting to know him he goes through tough times in the cell. Everything about this film is just unbelievable. Honestly just watch it for sure	10
 Best Crime Movie i ever seen	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 Great Film	It was a great film, Enjoyed it from start to finish. The Characters worked great together to make a very convincing and exciting piece. I have now watched it multiple times and it has always been just as good if not better with each watch, I have now recommended to many others who have all had the same reaction. This defiantly deserves top spot on IMDb. It is a Masterpiece. Found it too long at some points. I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as I did. This is a great review. Thank you for your time. I am glad you read my review or didn't its completely up to you its your life. Have a nice day and hopefully you do other things with it other than reading interesting reviews from randoms who are starting to write about random things. Anyway great film would recommend.	9
 Hypnotic	Every movie I have ever watched more than once - and i have watched a lot - has at least one scene that i would either skip or use to go grab something from the fridge, turn up/down the AC or something. Except The Shawshank Redemption. From the opening scene till the very end, i want to do nothing but sit through and watch, feel and react to each part of the story.Everything in the film fits together in an amazing harmony, engaging all your senses and emotions from the very beginning. This is my humble opinion, and I am not surprised to see it on the top of so many lists.A true example and a benchmark to many film makers, from story to acting, cinematography to editing.	10
 When i was trapped!	"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance."	9
 this is a masterpiece of Robbins and freeman	"This movie deserves 10/10. And yeah you can can say that there are so many things that help you cut down its rating as left most cell for Andy(A hotshot banker on whom this movie is pictured) or Bogs only dicks with Andy, so what it is still a MOVIE based on novel of Stephan king. Its just that its an ""EPIC MOVIE"". The narration by Morgan freeman is remarkable, it feels like someone is whispering in your ears, when this movie reaches it mid you starts to adore the relation between Andy and red. and that night Andy finally redeem himself from prison, that Rita Haywood poster, that chess board and everything, you starts to love when detailed by red. this movie also has a cliché in which Andy makes himself rich which you want to see and how he keeps his mind occupied and what they think about him. ""Some birds are not meant to be caged, Their feathers are just too bright""."	10
 Good movie	Its a classic movie for sure. First I really didn't know what to make of the movie when the trailer first came out. Just some minutes into the movie, I found myself loving every bit of it, from the beginning to the end. It has everything you want in a classic movie. Its funny, sad, smart. Takes you through all the human emotions at every scene. Really enjoyed watching this movie. Can watch over and over again. Great cast with amazing acting. Anyone who appreciates the art of movies will definitely enjoy and be hooked on this movie. What more can one say about a very well made movie. It's going down as one of the best movies ever made for sure. Awesome!!	9

 Eye-Opening!	"I am 22; And I was craving a well plotted movie the other day. And quite frankly I was quite bored of fantasy movies. I wanted to watch something that had to do with the system. I decided to go through the list of top movies of all times, according to IMDb. The Shawshank Redemption was ranked number one based on popularity. I watched the trailer and I immediately fell in love with the fact that it was narrated by Morgan Freeman and that it was about the prison system in the previous century. The movie The Shawshank Redemption Is about a character named Andy Dufresne, an introverted,young,successful banker. In 1947, one fine morning, Andy finds himself guilty of a crime that he repeated says he didn't commit. However, the evidence says otherwise. They charge him for murdering his wife and her lover. Double life sentence. He soon finds himself in one of the harshest prison in the country. There he meets Red and his friends. Andy takes his time but slowly, tactically, befriends them. Andy's wide range of skills helps him get on good terms with the prison guards, and even the Prison Warden. The Warden soon finds Andy so useful that he starts making Andy help him with his bank statements, allowing him to launder money without any suspicion.Soon Tommy Williams enters the picture, and what he discloses changes everything. The movie was very well directed. However, I wish the story focused a little more on how Andy manages to create a false identity. Overall, the movie was very interesting. I loved how they portrayed all the inmates and their problems. I very much appreciated the fact that they didn't show the prison rapes in details, and left most of it to the imagination. Andy's unreadable characteristics were very well played by the actor Tim Robbins. Throughout the whole time, I simply couldn't figure out whether he was really innocent or not, until Tommy Williams enters the picture. Andy's and Red's friendship develops very realistically. The little jokes they share were very amusing, especially the first time they talk, when Andy asks Red why his name is Red. The villainous Warden's character was very unpredictable. His ""Strict Christian"" image was brilliant. It made it seem that he might have a little bit of goodness inside, but as the story unveils, he turns out to be pure evil. The movie overall was intriguing. It does show some real issues that inmates go through- discrimination, sexual frustration, institutionalization and all forms of abuse. I think the movie is very eye opening. I think the message it wants to send out is that one should get to know the system and how it works so that when the system turns abusive, one can do something about it."	10
 The friendship between prisoner in Shawshank.	"This film really impressed. We can feel the friendship between Red and Andy. They start from stranger to become a best friend. Even they are not contact for many years but friendship doesn't gone. I really surprise in the middle of movie that Andy is innocent, because from the beginning at movie, the first day in prison. He look not fear in the prison. In addition, he really intelligence and no one know his plan for escape the prison. In this movie we see difference between Brooks and Red, they are out from prison when they get older but they choose in different way. It like Andy told Red ""get busy watching or get busy dying""."	9
 My best movie of all time	The Shawshank Redemption is a Prison tricky film. The prison itself becomes a metaphor for the society, or even to retard people from being completely free instead.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, an intelligent banker convicted of killing his wife and her lover is wrongly sent to Shawshank Prison. The first and best friend that he makes is Red, the elder statesman of the yard, played by Morgan Freeman, the one that obviously a great actor who never ever did wrong in his career.At Shawshank, they communicating us about how to survive in here, and what you need to maintain a stage of humanity, which literally reflect us about reality of life. The warden, sexually abused by inmates and even beaten by guards harasses Andy. Sooner or later, Andy gets used to his new living arrangement which someone called home, but still has hope that he will leave Shawshank. As well as he try to reminds others to be hopeful.Shawshank Redemption is not to reform you, but totally drive you crazy. It's not just a film for entertainment; it's educating us about what life really is. Even though the film offers us a prison and corruption, it's definitely warmth my heart and so do you.	9
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" Stockholm Syndrome - you and I are the patient!"	"Stockholm Syndrome (Stockholm syndrome), Stockholm effect, also known as the Stockholm syndrome or complex known as hostages or hostage syndrome refers to victims of crime for offenders generate emotion, and even help turn a complex offender. The emotion caused by the victim against the perpetrators feel good, dependent on the heart, and even help the offender.

Unexpected changes in mental intricate under which four hostages ultimately resist government efforts to rescue them. This incident inspired the social scientists who want to understand the feelings of kidnappings hijacked between those with a combination in the end took place in Stockholm bank robbery this from a fatal exception, or the combination of this emotion represents a a common psychological reactions. Later, studies show that since researchers called the ""Stockholm Syndrome"" event, surprisingly common. If you meet the following conditions, any person may suffer from Stockholm syndrome. The first one is to you truly feel your life is threatened, make you feel, as is not necessarily going to happen. Then people believe that this violence will do at any time, without hesitation.

With under four conditions, people will have Stockholm syndrome. In a sense, the formation of the Stockholm syndrome, the same throughout the ""institutionalized"" at home. ""Institutionalization"" is an important concept famous movie ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (Shawshank Redemption) deduction. Prisoner old Reid (Morgan Freeman) said of ""institutionalized (institutionalized)"": ""At first you hate it (prison), then you get used to it, after enough time you come to rely on it, this is the system technology. "" The film was institutionalized symbolic figure of old cloth prison librarian, he was imprisoned for 50 years in Shawshank prison under (system), which is almost exhausted his lifetime time. However, when released from prison when he was informed that you are going, not only did not full of joy, but faced with spiritual collapse, because he can not do without the prison. To this end, the old cloth at a knife to kill, in order to continue to serve their sentences in prison. He fell in love with that room unforgettable deprived of his freedom of prison, so after his release, he finally chose to commit suicide.

In fact, we are more or less every Chinese person suffering from Stockholm syndrome, or political education on! Merely reflect more as a chronic symptom, more seriously, is the ""mass Stockholm Syndrome."" We all the time is ""institutionalized (institutionalized)""!"	10
 sum it up	This movie is without a doubt is one of the most brilliant films. It encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it gives hope in a dark place like prison there can be love,fun, happiness, kindness and hope...It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.Frank Darabont directed only 2 movies and both of them were amazing. What more can be said about this film? Pulp Fiction and Forest Gump were released in the same year and I would still choose this movie over the other 2. Can't believe this movie didn't take home any Oscar. It's absolutely brilliant and captures the mind with its simplicity. Hollywood doesn't make them like this anymore.	10
 Best film ever!	"I am aware that by now almost everyone knows the plot of this film, but since this is my first reviewed title on IMDb, I'll do my part in explaining it.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on the Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"". Set in New England, the film tells the story of a young banker named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he befriends Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), nicknamed ""Red"" by his friends, and his gang. But he also catches the eyes of ""The Sisters"", a gang of rapists and bullies led by Bogs (Mark Rolston). He then must make up his escape plan, while aiding the guards and most importantly the warden (Bob Gunton) to cheat on their taxes.I was deeply impressed by this film since the first time I watched it, and has remained my favorite film ever since. All of the main actors play their parts beautifully (Freeman in particular), and the ending is the most powerful I have ever seen.A must-see for everyone."	10
 Hope overcomes everything		10
 Unparalleled Masterpiece	I know it is absolutely shocking to you that the #1 movie on IMDb's Top 250 is my (and many, many others') favorite movie. Why, you may ask? (and I would respond with a quizzical look and say what do you mean why?) Because it is simply perfection in every facet of the film making process. The direction is magnificent as Darabont gets wonderful performances from his entire cast and paced the movie perfectly. It's a long film, but doesn't feel that way. Darabont of course also gets credit as the writer, and the writing is masterful. There are so many memorable lines. The cast is amazing and the performance by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are unforgettable. God I love this movie. The end scene makes me shed a tear every time.	10
 good	"Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive.

James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized""."	
 Excellent Movie	The Shawshank redemption is an excellent movie that was executed perfectly. Based off of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the movie did an exceptional job of recreating the story. The Shawshank Redemption is a top class movie that needs to be seen by anyone and everyone with the perfect features to make it stand out in the crowd of movies.The acting in the movie The Shawshank Redemption is one of the main reasons that the movie turned out to be so wonderful. Combining the skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman proved to be a pair for the ages. With two characters, one quiet, reserved character and one popular, outspoken character, both played by actors with similar personalities. Appreciation was shown for the acting in this movie when Morgan Freeman was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Academy Awards 1995). Although he lost, it is still impressive considering he lost to Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump/ These two actors were not the only actors vital to the production of this movie. Each individual side character was played by an actor perfect for the part. No actor could have done justice to any of the characters like the actors who starred in the film did.The story of the movie was possibly one of the best told stories of all time. Although it is a recent story when compared with stories from all time, it does the perfect job of immersing you in the lives and feelings of the characters and of keeping you hooked on what happens next the whole time. Stephen King started off by writing this masterpiece of a story in his novella and Frank Darabont worked with this masterpiece and wrote and directed one of the top one hundred movies of all time (AFI Top 100). The story is told over a just longer than two hour movie, that does not go on too long or too short. After the viewer has finished watching the movie, they are perfectly satisfied.The Shawshank Redemption has a Motion Picture Association of America rating of R, or restricted. This rating should be lowered too PG-13, known as Parents Strongly Cautioned. Although the movie does have slight hints at sexual activity and scenes with murders and suicide, this does not outweigh the benefit of people seeing this movie. No person of the age above thirteen, or maybe even lower, should be denied the right to view this movie. The Shawshank Redemption has the potential to have an enormous effect on the lives of those who view it. And even if it does not impact their lives, it still could easily change their perception of a good movie or just be an enjoyable two hours of their lives. Without such heavy restrictions on the age of those who can view the movie, maybe it could have a chance to be more widely viewed, and ultimately more widely appreciated.The AFI Rating of The Shawshank Redemption shows it ranked as the number seventy two American movie of the past one hundred years (AFI Top 100). I strongly disagree with this rating. The Shawshank Redemption, although it didn't cause any revelations in the movie world (mostly because it was too recent to have done so), is one of the best filmed movies of all time. I personally would rate The Shawshank Redemption in the top ten of all movies, and number one on my own personal list. The less official Internet Movie Database ranking of movies has The Shawshank Redemption as the number one movie of all time (IMDB Top 250). This is a much more agreeable rating for my own opinion on the movie. Having seen five of the top ten movies on AFI's renowned list, I do not believe any of them compare to the quality and entertainment value of The Shawshank Redemption. Although I earlier agreed with AFI's rating of The Shawshank Redemption in the top one hundred, I believe it should be much higher than the ranking they decided on.Overall, the Shawshank Redemption is a movie that will go down in history as one of the best movies ever created. This future historical relevance is not an exaggeration. If anything, The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated movie. It's not too often that there comes a movie that is as well made as The Shawshank Redemption, so when one is, it is important to fully appreciate it. The Shawshank Redemption is a grade A movie made up of the perfect components of story and acting which come together to make one of the best movies of all time.	10

 Simply the best movie	When I saw this movie for the first time it made a deep impression on me.The storyline is interesting and the characters are strong.There are some good one liners in the movie what make you remember.It's funny but actually you learn from this movie. Facts that can be useful in real life.The movie what makes it so good in score from everybody is that almost everybody recognize in characters and some scenes.The only disappointing in the movie is the end. You want looking more of the movie, how the story goes further. But this only proves that is very interesting story.I recommend everybody to see this movie.	10
 Flawless Cinematography	Personally this film is listed in my top 20 favorite movies of all time and that is a pretty hard list to get in to. The Director did a marvelous job with this film, the cinematography is amazing, along with a talented cast it's a hard one to beat (well Green Mile does but that's another review)I have read the negative comments and all I can say to that is (as a film maker myself)well is that not the magic of cinema? Nothing created for the cinema as fiction is ever real to life or it wouldn't be called a movie but a documentary but that's my opinion.I think the story is both captivating and well told on the screen and it doesn't get the credit it deserves.	10

 I love it		9
 All about the story. Inspiring for most, but not for skeptics.	"This is not a movie to be watched just for the heck of it. You can't just stumble upon it as you can when looking for an action or comedy movie. Not to say that it can't happen, but if you're going to watch this movie, you have to focus on it and watch it all the way through within a week. I don't know if it is a good representation of modern prisons or prisons from the time it takes place, but regardless of that, you feel for the two protagonists. I found the predicament of Andy to be completely horrific and unfair (though I wish I could find a better word to use here than ""unfair""). Some people might find the message of hope to be kind of corny, which is a view that I can understand but don't share and I'm a guy that finds many things to be corny. The life of the prisoners is brutal, partly because of the guards, but partly because of the conduct of the prisoners. Andy is easy to sympathize with, but also easy to root for because of his perseverance and hope. I like Morgan Freeman's character, Red, too. There is an air of dignity that sets him and Andy apart from the other prisoners. The one rather implausible character point that I found was Andy's selflessness. His ability to sympathize with his fellow inmates and his willingness to better their lives does not necessarily do anything to his desire for the same benefits that they reap. His motive is certainly to help his fellow inmates, but I don't feel like he would as a human just let his hard earned rewards be wasted. The one other main character is the warden, who can either be viewed as a good heartless villain or a guy that the screenwriters forced a mean personality onto with no good reason. I'm not saying that either one is true, it just depends on where you're coming from. I read another review that criticizes the way the warden's quoting of the bible is sort of demonized and was a biased act by the producers. Personally, I disagree with that, because there are plenty of people in real life who use biblical passages and religious motives as an excuse to do bad things. One thing about his character that I didn't really understand was why he is so reluctant to let Andy go free. The story is rather like that of Mr. Holland's Opus in the sense that it is divided up by the minor characters that come and go throughout. You can see how Andy and Red make a difference in the lives of the other inmates and each other. The mystery of how Andy escapes at the end is pretty good, but not something that requires you to have remembered a lot of things from earlier to understand. For anyone considering watching it, I would recommend that you watch it alone or with someone who won't talk through it. Also, don't watch it if you're looking for anything outside of a good or emotional story. Overall Rating: 8.9/10"	8
 after a long time the innocent man was able to get him out of the shawshank	When i saw this movie ,I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director.The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener.The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks.i think this film is the best story ever told on film.I love this film.I watch this film 100 times.i will watch this movie more and more until i die.i also encourage my generation to watch this movie.Sometimes i share the story of this movie with my friends.then they watch it and became the fan of this movie.I want to give some credits to the director.	10
 amazing	amazing movie. Like the main actor so much. Everyone did a great job. It was overlooked in 1994 but gold always shines. It becomes so popular afterward. And it definitely deserves the fame. this movies reminds me about a lot things that I kinda forget in the daily life. What we are living for? What is the value of freedom. When you have the freedom, you won't feel anything about it. But when you lose it, freedom becomes the most important thing in your life, as important and necessary as the air. The movie is highly recommended. Tim Robinson is my favorite actor. I would highly recommend this movie to all my friends. I think they will all learn something from it.	
 Life of an innocent man in a draconian prison run by an evil warden.	I have forgotten how many times I have seen this outstanding, heart wrenching film.From start to finish, it has you captured into what life was like for an innocent man in the harshest prisons in America. The main character is of all things, a banker. He is framed for the murder of his wife playing away with another lover behind his back. Next thing you know the husband lands in prison and fighting to stay alive from all the inmates and prison officers. Luckily his accountancy profession saves him and rewards him at the same time. He makes friends with RED and ends up building up the library to a delux place of relaxation, reading and music playing for all the prisoners.The ending just blew my mind.You must see this film, but be warned.....it is absolutely addictive viewing.	10
 Moving	This film includes great actors such as Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.I find The Shawshank redemption to be one of the most intelligent movies of my life time; brilliant and captivating. The story is not for the faint of heart it shows the courage and resilience that the human spirit is capable of. Invoking the desperation of all of us...wondering; in this situation, how would we handle it? This film/ story is definitely one of my favorites from Stephen King's book of short stories. If you haven't taken the time to watch this you're missing out. I watch whenever I can and always feel satisfied at the end. From the music, to the attention to detail with the wardrobe, this movie is all-around a classic and should be put on your top 10 best list....today.... There's no way you could regret it.	10
 One of the Best movie I have been seen		10
 Best movie I've ever seen	Sometimes, a classic can come from an unexpected source. That's the case with the Shawshank Redemption. When you only hear about the plot, you'd guess that it may be very enjoyable, but it's been done before. The film is about a prison break. That doesn't sound like an original idea. Shawshank Redemption is based on a Steven King novella named 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'. Usually, the film adaptations of Stephen King's novels aren't very strong. The picture was directed by Frank Darabont, who didn't have much of a success record back in 1994. The two leading actors are Tim Robbins, who portrays Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman, who portrays Ellis Boyd Redding (simply known as 'Red'). While they are both very good actors, you wouldn't expect them to have a perfect chemistry. The film also didn't very well in the box office upon its release. So despite all of that, this film has often been referred to as one of the best films of all time. I think that's a fair point to make. You don't expect an all-time classic going into the Shawshank Redemption, but that's exactly what you're going to get. This films sucks you in and blows you away.Andy Dufresne is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947 because he murdered his wife and her lover, or so we believe. He's very introvert at first and doesn't interact with any of the prisoners. That is, however, until he asks Red if he could get Rita Hayworth to Shawshank. Red simply replies that it will take a little while, but he'll manage, since he's a man who knows how to get things. It eventually turns out to be a poster of Hayworth. When Red asks Andy why committed the crime he's been sentenced for, Andy states he's innocent. Of course every other prisoner in Shawshank state that they are innocent, except for Red, who tells Andy he's the only guilty man in the prison. Red and Andy develop a friendship over the years and the chemistry between the two is simply amazing. Andy befriends most of Red's friends, like Heywood (played by William Sadler) and the old man named Brooks Hatlen (played by James Whitmore). Andy's first couple of years in Shawshank are extremely difficult. The 'sisters' have an eye on him and especially their leader, Bogs (played by Mark Rolston). They attempt to rape Andy on several occasions. The prison is run by the corrupted warden named Samuel Norton (played by Bob Gunton) and his chief of the guards, Byron Hadley, who brutally assaults prisoners to demonstrate his power. In May of 1949, Red and his friends are selected to tar the roof of Shawshank, which keeps them outdoors for a couple of days. Andy confronts Byron Hadley about his financial issues. This eventually leads to an improved prison live for Andy and his friends. Andy helps the prison guards with their financial situation and eventually even does all of the wardens finances. In 1954, Brooks Hatlen is released from Shawshank after having stayed there for 50 years. He can't live a normal live outside of the prison walls and decides to hang himself. Red clarifies that Brook has become institutionalized. After Bogs and the 'sisters' nearly beat Andy to death, Byron Hadley assaults Bogs so so hard he is never able to walk again. Andy continues to control the wardens finances and explains to Red how all the 'dirty' money is washed clean. He made up a person on paper, named Randall Stevens, so all the trails lead to him, but because he's fictional, the I.R.S won't be able to catch anybody. In 1965, Tommy (played by Gil Bellows) arrives in Shawshank for a two year sentence. He's a young guy who loves Rock and Roll. He wants to be educated and Andy starts to teach him. At one point, Tommy hears Andy's story and reveals that Andy is innocent. Andy confronts the warden with this statement, but he's afraid Andy will reveal to the outside world what happens within the walls of Shawshank, so he puts Andy in isolation for two months. During his stretch in isolation, Tommy gets killed by Byron Hadley, because he knew too much, although the warden says he tried to escape. Andy meets Red after getting out of the isolation cell and tells him about his future plans, although Red waves it off by stating Andy's being unrealistic. Andy tells Red to never give up hope. Andy decides he's been in prison long enough and escapes through a tunnel he dug during his time in prison. The following day, Andy travels to Zihuatanejo, a place in Mexico. He leaves with half of Norton's money. The next morning, Byron Hadley is arrested for being a corrupt guard and the warden shoots a bullet through his own skull. After serving 40 years, Red is released from Shawshank. He goes through the same motions as Brooks did and you get the feeling he'll also hang himself, until he remembers he made a promise to Andy, so he searches for an old oak tree near Buxton and finds some money Andy's left for him. He decides to make the trip to Mexico and rejoices with his old friend Andy, while stating he finally dares to hope.This is, simply put, the best film ever created. It's incredibly powerful. The film really sucked me in. The chemistry between Andy and Red is undeniable and the performances from Robbins and Freeman are superb. The supportive cast also does a fantastic job. Clancy Brown as Byron Hadley really looks like a despicable bully and Bob Gunton as Samuel Norton plays his role as the corrupt warden perfectly. This film never drags and the remains entertaining for all of its 142 minutes. Films, in my opinion, don't get any better than the Shawshank Redemption.	10
 One of the best movies i have seen		9
 A masterpiece!	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	9
 Morgan Freeman & Tim Robbins	"In this Stephen King short story adaption, were amazing. One of the best prison movies. It is a story about hope and dreams. A friendship between inmates. Old fashioned movie without being boring. The story is captivating. Powerful acting. The story is narrated by Morgan Freeman. That makes the story even more interesting. One of the best movies of the nineties. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" will instantly become a favourite of anyone who watches it. I recommend it to any fan of Stephen King. And also to any fan of Morgan Freeman. But obviously if you are a fan, you should have seen it by now, except if you have missed it. It happens, I don't blame you, you gotta catch up!"	10
 Such a great movie!	The Shawshank redemption was and still one of the greatest movies of the 90's. Not only I watched it at least 30 times in the last year but I have been fascinated by the message of hope it conveys; I can sit here and tell you all the great things about this movie but you need to watch it to understand that there is nothing like it; Academy Award winner Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman clearly did a wonderful job. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption. The human kindness and cruelty in this movie are beyond what you can imagine; The director lovingly and patiently sculpts his large cast of characters against a magnificent scenery.	10
 Awesome Movie	"An excellent thriller movie to watch! So many years passed but it is still a superb movie. Freeman has played an excellent role in the movie.I wish if this movie had some kind of sequel. The movie is that much great that if we watch if 100 times we'll still enjoy it. I really liked the movie because of it's thriller. I liked the movie "" Shutter Island"" because it is as thrilling as this one. The part where Andy gets to know about the killer is the most awesome part of the movie. The best part after that was the escape through a dirty place, everything in the movie was fantastic. I do not have the words to praise this movie. Even 1000 lines are not enough for it."	10
 Good	My advice would be to watch this movie in full before you judge it. Actually, the movie itself is nothing special, but it has some good stuff. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do, however, drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The leads' combined talents and charisma have a lot to do with this movie's success. I found the acting to be sensational, the dialogue incredible and the director's abilities to be up to par and then some. It reminds me of some of those Croatian films that were popular back in the 1990s. My final rating comes in at seven out of 10 stars.	7
 Best movie made	At first skeptical of this movie had heard spoken of it to be so good just not what everyone said about Shawnshank Redemption. So I checked in and as usual when I see the film are the first 10 to 15 minutes not good Then I do not check the whole movie. but was Hooked after about 10 minutes and thought This is a Awesome movie So clearly the best movie ever made IT have a great storyline and all but the actors are world class. When u think off todays stars the old movie stars are The basis for today's Stars But thats just my Taste. Anyways what i wanna tell u all is this movie is worth checking out If u have not any idea what u wanna watch a Rainy day // JP	10
 A great movie about two men who meet in prison	I had to watch the movie for my English class but can i just say it was one of the best texts we have studied. The whole movie is just constantly interesting and even if you don't watch the film for the actors or the writers or the produces, you stay for the story. Because lets be honest, there is nothing better than a prison break story. The constant changes in story lines, learning about each characters lives in and out of the prison walls, the relationships formed and broken, and the beautifully narrated story is one great film that helped me really see things from an interesting perspective. All in all, i give this movie 10/10 because there are many prison movies out there, but this one takes the cake.	10
 One of the finest film in the world		10
 One of my favorites	From the moment I first watched this film, it became a favorite. There is a lot of drama, action, and compassion in this film. By the end, you feel yourself caring for the entire cast. Morgan Freeman is at his best in this film, and I have to say the same for Tim Robbins as well. James Whitmore stole my heart from the second he walked on the screen. It is a bit long, but the story moves at a great pace and you don't realize how long it is until you seethe clock. If you haven't seen this movie, you should. You will love it. Stephen King is a brilliant writer and Frank Darabont's screenplay does King justice. It is truly a must-see! It does not disappoint in any way.	10
 Very Moving!!!!!!!!!	if your looking for a really moving deep story line. with much discovery of the human life and journey to over coming obstacles and much of what fine filming is all about. this is your ticket to Shawshank Redemtion. i highly recommend this to all those of Morgan freeman lovers. and as well prison stories. this moving will get you moving in places you never thought of. and keeps you thinking to the very end. and how as humans what do you have to do to fit in life. from my overall experience watching this film. all the emotions and right hit points that deliver this masterful work piece of art. it really defines movie making and turning points of life. i only wish that more film can at least get as close to this now a days. hope that you find everything your into looking for in this film. like i did, and took from it and made an enjoyment out of it. =]	10
 Masterpiece	This movie is truly a work of art.. The script, the Plot and the roles played by the characters are simply perfect. Even the slightest scenes are carefully overlooked by the Director. All together they form an amazing movie about friendship,loyalty and the true power of the human mind and with the appearance of Morgan Freeman which is a living Icon in the movie business, he puts all his effort and dedication to the completion and the perfection of this movie even with his narrative speech in the beginning.. Finally, Shawshank Redemption deserves it's place on the no 1 all times movies simply because it has all the necessary things to be remembered.	10
 few reviews	most reviews measure up up to the book,,,, but this movie is better than the book....... it is the cast you see that does itI did read the book after reading the book.... and found a tighter story..... I will watch it anytime it's os on,,,,, I do have a greater understanding of the story ........ THIS is a great movie,,,,,, if you can watch 1 movie...is is one of the top 100. even the top 50 for all, who want to tell, a story that is a template to use........hope is a thing.... that nobody can estimate and,,, no one can judge..... stories,,,,,everybody is innocent....	10
 Masterpiece	i have seen this movie at least 5 times and i have enjoyed it equally every single time!the story is really interesting and doesn't lose its red line and as a watcher you are connected to the movie. the story is like realistic (i hope you get what i mean) like it could happen in our or maybe it has already.however this movie was really enjoyable and also i loved the music. we could talk endless about the music and how good it was so i will leave it there.i watch a lot of films and since you are here in IMDb means also that you watch a lot of films by yourself but this movie is nothing like we see these days. some people (i know them) don't like or watch a movie because people talk so much about, weird huh, i know. watch this movie and you will not regret it!	8
 Truly Classic !!!		8
 Best film	Of course it is the best film ever.And maybe Back to the future. I really do not suppose to blame this movie. It is a masterpiece. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are acting incredibly well in this film.I I should really criticize this movie , I would rather say no , because the directing , the shooting and the montages of this work together build up a Donatello masterpiece, and I haven't said anything about the soundtrack. It is amazing also. The prison scenes are farewell. Rather say yes, than no. So, that's the matter , why a single attendant behave like this during the picture of this film. I do not have to grind a false face. It is the truth, it is a real masterpiece!	10
 A Perfect Movie	"One of the best movies of all time. The acting in incredible, the story is captivating and engaging, and every actor comes through in a big way. A truly wonderful movie. If you have not seen it, you will not be disappointed when you do. The story, chiefly about the 20-year friendship between Freeman and Robbins. Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover. Set in the 1940's, the film shows how Andy learns to get by in the brutal confines of prison, even earning the respect of his fellow inmates, most notably the longtime convict ""Red"" Redding (Freeman)"	9
 Andy was in a good film (misquote from film)	Greatest movie ever made, sounds like a cliché but it is true this time. If you are figuring out what to watch between this and the godfather (because that's what the top 250 said) then choose this one! It has elements in it that we can all relate to or inspire to and elements in which we can all escape to through another world we don't know about. I chose this film as my first review as i thought it was worth my while so take the hint please! If you like sci-fi fantasy be prepared to not be amazed in this area but i would say it is a fantasy through the eyes of Red (Morgan Freeman's character) because he does go on a bit about how he has never seen someone like Andy (Tim Robbins) before. If Morgan Freeman thinks he's cool then he is cool therefore this film is cool end of.	10
 Masterpiece	Movie is really a masterpiece. I had already watched it many times and i am going watch again many times in future.An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90's and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! A simple story that touches the bottom of the heart. The concept of this movie is the best and unique. No Action ,Fight ,Drama ,Romance. Just a sober bond of emotions. The work done by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman deserves a great applause.Watching these actors work together is a real treat, and they more than make up for the script's deficiencies. No Oscar is bad luck of this movie but 16 awards is what it deserves.Powerful, poignant, thought- provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting. At end i would recommend everyone to watch this movie once.	10
 Great Movie	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 One of the best movies I seen so far!	"First of all sorry for my not perfect English, it's not my native language.In my opinion ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best movies which I seen so far! Twenty years ago this movie was a ""low-key prison"" film that didn't get back its costs. But now it has become one of the most popular movies of all time! Everything is amazing there: actors play, shooting scenes, the story itself of course... I already have seen it more than 10 times and I believe that I definitely will do it again once more!This is first movie and the only one which I rated with 10 stars!"	10
 Powerful, poignant and thought-provoking...	An amazing movie. One of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their best. A true classic. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you go watch it as soon as possible!After being convicted of murdering his wife, something he denies, smart and banker Andy Duffrain (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank prison, which is run by a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton). He makes friends with some of the inmates but his closest relationship is with Red (Morgan Freeman) a wise lifer who is a you want it, he can get sort of guy. After many years there, and after the last straw from the warden, Andy does something that will be remembered throughout the history of Shawshank prison. The lot of this film is equally incredible with story and characters, we love whats going on the entire film because every moment is important to the ending of the film, and the characters of the movie are just perfection, Andy and Red as best friends is probably the greatest friendship I have ever seen a film and that makes it impossible to dislike them and how colorful and fun the supporting characters are, what an incredible and beautiful movie that shows the horrors of prison. The cast is just incredible, Tim Robbins plays his most memorable and best performance of his career if you ask me, and Morgan Freeman has also his greatest role to date and truly deserved his Oscar as much as everyone else that year, they were just incredible.	10
 Brilliant, clever film!	"I've always enjoyed a good prison series/film, but this one exceeded all others! My favorite part of the film was definitely when the main actor made an alliance with Morgan freeman! Such great chemistry there, there were also some tense moments. It is not one of them films which I can easily watch over and over simply because it is such a long film and because it takes a while to forget the plot, and if you have already watched it, the build up to seeing the main actor escape the prison is no longer a tense surprising moment.So clever and the casting was perfect! I think the film sells itself! In perspective i would rate this film 10/10 for everything, even with the age of the film (1994) it will always be a ""one to watch"" film for generations to come."	9
 The greatest movie ever made.	"The Shawshank Redemption is in my mind undeniably the greatest movie ever made. This film breaks down the essence of human existence, embodies the human condition, and shows that when knocked down there is always hope. Just as Andy said ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"". That is what this film is it is not just a prison film it is not just a redemption story it is truly a lesson. This film is a masterpiece only a few films in existence come remotely close to this movie but none can compare.I would recommend this film to everyone because what you get out of it is all based on your beliefs but everyone can agree that this is a masterpiece that should endure throughout the ages."	10
 Good	When I started watching the movie, I thought: This is going to be another one of those movies drama in prison, where the guy suffers and escapes and lives happily forever. Just waiting there. Not so. The film reaches the spiritual side of things. Shows how this affects people psychologically. Having cut his freedom is yes, one of the worst things in the world, even when there is no fault. But when you get used to the place, the rules, what is inside you, it becomes your place, your truth. And then you go out. Now what? How do I live? I do not know no more walking on the street! This can really drive someone insane. Another important point is the issue of corruption in jail. Not that common place fell to be the focus of this thing. Was already structured, it was not something that needed to be nor explained. Corruption in the chain is already so common to us, which is not something that needs 20 minutes of film to explain how it works - despite the great scene in the library where Andy pro account as Red in Shawshank laundering scheme works.	10
 You'll never forget this movie...	It is very rare that you will ever come across a movie of this calibre in your entire life. Masterpiece is the only way to describe it.From the moment it starts, you're hooked. You learn of Andy and being sent to prison. The acting is phenomenal, and of course, the viewer is treated with narration from Morgan Freeman throughout the movie.After that, you get to know each character well, all excellently written and diverse. The script is highly intelligent, and the dialogue flows in a smooth and believable way.You find yourself gripped for EVERY second as Andy's perfect plan unfolds, into a tremendous climax, leaving you emotional as you have seen his struggle.If anyone considers themselves a movie fan, then they not only should have seen this film; they should own it.One of the best!!	10
 excellent film	The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. Morgan Freeman did a really good job on acting.... i love it. I was really learning some things in this movie. I like Morgan Freeman films because he is really a good actor. I recommend you this film to watch at least once, because this is a legendary film.I love it when in the end he founds the box with this letter. And then he travels to this place where his friend Andy was repairing the boat. I really enjoyed watching this legendary film. And also this film was made by a true story so it really makes it very very very very very very very good. I hope they will make good films in the future too inspired by a true stories.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever seen.	The story of a man struggling to survive in one of the most hostile environments possibly know by any human being took my breath away. He did not deserve to be there, he was innocent from the beginning, but instead of claiming his innocence, he worked from day one to find a way to scape from all that. He never quit fighting. A lesson to us all. The plots are amazingly driven. The characters arc is strong and understandable from begging to end. Photography is captivating. Acting is precise, and reach the soul of the subtext all the way. The director really knew how to pull together an award winning team. Every aspect of the script is taken care of. The producers went the distance in this one. A masterclass in acting, directing, photography, production but most important, scriptwriting. Thou I did not read the book, I guess the film did justice to it. I'm sure Steven King feels really proud of it. A must see to everyone who loves good films, or pretends to break into the film industry.	10
 Must watch movie.before u die	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It is ranked #1 in IMDb's ""Top 250"" list and is considered one of the best movies of all time -Says WikipediaParents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.Must watch movie.before u die !!"	9
 Beautyfull Movie	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.	10
 Flawless ain't perfect.	I don't think Shawshank is perfect. To be honest I don't even think it deserves the #1 at the IMDb Top 250. The thing about it is that you can't point anything wrong, there is nothing that anybody would really dislike. The highest note is somewhat odd though, it would not make my own top 10, despite of all the compliments I could make about it.There are a few memorable quotes, the always great Morgan Freeman, but nothing that i would call outstanding. A good movie, definitely worth watching, but not one of those you would watch over and over again until you got all dialogues by heart.	9

 Passion for Shawshank		
 Essential to view it	One of the best performances of Morgan Freeman and probably the best one for Tim Robbins. I never get tired of watching it again and again. This story, keeps you aware the entire duration of the movie, and the soundtrack, one of my favorites composed by Thomas Newman gives the tale even more grandeur. It's an impeccable direction from Frank Darabont, as he did on The Green Mile. Also it might make you reconsider some aspects of your life and to value more your time. The photography, costume, art direction, all of them are astonishing which deserved many more prizes and recognitions than it received. It's definitely one the best films made on the 90's and it's a piece of art int the film history. Nowadays I wish and I hope in Hollywood were made such great films as The Shawshank Redemption, but it seems lack of new ideas and making remakes every year. In my humble opinion, what Hollywood needs it's an entire REBOOT, not only with screenwriters but in direction and production.	8
 One of the best	I watched this movie about five years ago. I am right now 21 and i love to watch movies especially new ones. My favorite genre is Action, Thriller and Comedy but this drama was one of the best movies that i have watched in the last five years. So if you didn't watch this one make sure you do it! Amazing story, fantastic actors (Freeman) my favorite one. Injustice and the real life are represented in this film. My advice to sit back grab some popcorn and watch it in the night, the better the effect. By the end you do not know what's going to happen, exciting and interesting. It is well recorded, and my opinion is that deserves a clear 10. Cheers!	10
 never get old	After all this years,I have been watched so many movies,but no one can compare with this greatest movie in the world in my mind!The god father is great too,but honestly,I prefect this movie to others,because the movie show us to keep on doing something what is right,and no can't stop you,first time I watched this movie,I was shocked,what kind of man like that,knew how to find out the other road for freedom in his own way,even takes long long time to get what he wanted,this is what I learn from it,no matter how hard it is on my road,there is one way to go through it,and get what you want!never get old,fellows,you have dream,you go get it,even take you years and years to get it,and after that,you feel young forever!	10

 It's just an epic	"This movie is still on the top of the 250 . that's the only reason. you should watch it,except it's a great story and a great casting. the line ""REMEMBER HOPE IS GOOD THING"" really a touching line after all.. i just love the concept of it. in case you haven't watched the PRISON BREAK.this movie will make you fall in love with. all of the suspense in the movie was spectacular obviously. it's shows the friendship between the two people were definitely a bond of H2o unable to break. for the new viewer like me i didn't like the printing of the movie or maybe it's was my digital copy effect. but i think in 1994 the camera were not so good like today so. i will say that watching 2 hours were not wasted, it's all good and not boring too."	9
 the best	the best movie ever the idea of Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency is brilliant. the acting is amazing and very realistic and directing genius either imaging has chosen photographer places and wonderful sights to reflect the credibility of the film. It's great in the movie he was persuaded trick the viewer completely and until the end of the film did not expect one of what happened. And lead them the message that the film is a wonderful idea and try and insist to reach the target in addition to the importance of freedom and how wonderful Come. The trick placebo bank account they are wonderful and reflect the extent of intelligent writer and director. It's great in the film that he also describes the lives of the prisoners in that period, and the extent of the injustice of the law in that period.	10
 The Best Movie I've Ever Seen	"When I've seen this movie, I had just one movie with a 10-rating and didn't believe this could beat it (in my opinion). However, when the credits started, I knew why this is on the top: People have large expectations on ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and also their all-time favourite movies, but it seems it can touch nearly every person deeply. I really love this masterpiece from the beginning to the end, but I don't think it's perfect, the beginning is a little bit too violent and mostly I don't like erotic scenes (because it seems like the movie wants a cheap upgrade). This is just nitpicking and doesn't change the fantastic atmosphere, characters, soundtracks, story and all the deep messages behind it.10/10"	10
 Three words: simple, inspirational and great.		9
 Truly Wonder Film		10
 I have to say this maybe my favorite movie ever	This has to be for me one of the best feel good and most inspiration movies ever. I have to agree that this is a movie that one should own not borrow or rent. If I ever had to say to someone watch this movie this would easily be the one.There are so many reasons for loving this amazingly good movie, but one for me is the life lessons that we learn from this one. I'm not one of those people that likes to give things away. So I wont be using any examples.The cast is great and story is probably one of the best when it comes to movies.	10
 Simply the Best	This is one of those movies which you remember forever. You remember the feeling that you had after watching it. Simply the best movie I have ever seen, great acting, great directing and great writing makes it the best movie there is. Truly deserves to be on the top as the #1 ranked movie on IMDb.Not only the lead actors have performed well but also the rest of the cast, everyone has given their best performance. The story keeps you attached till the end. And when you see the end you get a great feeling, you feel from the inside that this was something really good.And the direction is amazing and some of the scenes are so beautiful to see and the island really looks like a heavenly place.	10
 Differential	Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Anyone who read the Stephen King novel knows red turns from a white guy to a black one. and the guard casually ripping the poster at the end is different but other than those small changes, everything else is on point. This is the best prison movie ever made in my opinion. Certain ironies play out very well in this film. For instance the head sister who get cripple when Andy has had enough of his ilk. A 'life-affirming' tale about life imprisonment, The Shawshank Redemption is the kind of old-fashioned entertainment that is easily overvalued in an era of diminishing expectations.	10
 One of the Best	It is clearly one of the best movie I've seen. It's a shame that it didn't win the Oscar for the best picture or best director. Direction, screenplay,acting everything was brilliant.Tim Robbins was simply outstanding in every aspects. And there was Morgan Freeman. I am a huge fan of him. This duo made this movie excellent, of course along with the director Frank Darabont. The plot evolves around two imprisoned men Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) and Red(Morgan Freeman). The former was imprisoned for murdering his wife and her lover. With the time goes on Andy helps his friends and become a popular figure.But the director kept the best part of the movie at the end.	10
 0's baby	I dunno, I'm a 90's baby (born in 1990) and I loved this movie. It just has so much going for it. Great and well fleshed out characters, the soundtrack, the story telling itself, just everything to me is fantastic. I guess it's just one of those things that just feels organic for some and not so much for others. Don't delve too much into WHY you didn't like the movie as much as others did, just accept that the movie just didn't have the same impact to you as it did to others, because I don't think this is one of those movies you can really explain.I feel the same way about The Big Lebowski. So many people name it as one of the greatest comedies of all time, and I just think it's meh...*puts up flame retardant shield*	10
 awesome movie		10
 ShawShank Redemption		10
 One of the Greats!	Truly one of the greatest films of all time, TSR is an unbelievable film, that shows with hard work and passion, even first time directors should be taken seriously. I absolutely love Morgan Freemans character, and I love Tim Robbin; in fact the entire cast is awesome! Not a single frame of film was wasted in this picture. Every frame has a meaning and some sort of emotion to it... I don't think there will ever be another movie quite like it... I can tell it took yrs of planning an d scrutiny and Im sure wasn't easy to do. I love Frank Darabont, and it seems anything he touches in it's first iteration, turns to gold... sad what happened with The Walking Dead, but this truly is a masterpiece.	10
 Fantastic!	Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen, might actually be the best! Everything is good about it, the acting, the story, the setting, the characters! Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie, you will not regret it, I'm pretty sure nobody did regret it! It's not a complex movie by all means, it has a simple story, no special effects, but, maybe, the fact that it doesn't have hundreds of special effects truly helps it in feeling real. The harsh life in prison, the fact that he's just a simple man, and doesn't have connections in there, keeps you on your toes and thinking that Shawshank will be this inmate's grave. Stop reading so many reviews, and go ahead and watch it!	10
 A must-watch!	This is (just like Shutter Island) one of the best movies I've ever saw in my whole life. This film is really long, but it doesn't matter, for me it wasn't long enough! :) I really liked the whole story, from the beginning till the very end. It is a pretty sad movie at some points, but at the end it's actually a 'feel-good' movie. After watching this you realize how happy you have to be because you are a free man. Some people spend they're whole life in prison, and that's pretty sick. Because yeah, you life only 1 time, and now I really know how lucky I am. This movie is now number 1 for a very long time, that means 1 thing: you definitely need to watch this, you can't die without watching this movie! You won't regret it :). It is pretty funny to see Morgan Freeman acting in his younger years, then you realize how old this movie actually is. Time flies by, and that's actually one of the lessons you learn from this movie.	8
 Best Movie Ever...	This movie is brilliant in every way... It will always hold a spot in my heart and mind. This movie will outlast any action thriller...sorry J.J.. The music is breathtaking.Such longing... truly talented composer... The actors are great.The look and feel and smell and taste, touch... It is all great, pulls you in and you feel like your really there. This movie makes me wish I lived in that time. Besides the rape, being in that prison looks like so much fun. such a simple time. I even love the cloths. It all feels so real. I wish I could live in that era. I am not a great writer, but this movie is and will impact my life forever. Jordan Daniel Brackett	10
 Not a bad movie	I've watched this movie for the first time like 20 years ago (when i was a little boy), but recently friend of mine wanted to watch it again, so we did. Nowadays movies are full of clichés and remakes of old good movies, but compared to this one they are like crap. Tons of money are wasted on 3D effects, sound and other 'extras', but the movies are bad. They are no new stories... only the same old stories - vampires, aliens, fast cars, war and the drama... so much dramas... why would we want watch some dramas? Ain't we living our own dramas every day? This is a masterpiece movie and i regret that no one make such good movies anymore!	9
 Amazing Hopeful	"The Shawshank redemption is about a man who is wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to life in prison. In prison the man makes friends with the inmates while improving the prison's library. He also gives financial advice to the prison security guards and personnel. The theme of this film, The Shawshank Redemption, is about finding friendship and having hope while being at a hard time in your life. Andy Dufresne is play by Tim Robbins and is the main character who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover in a jealous rage. Morgan Freeman also plays a huge part in this film as Ellis ""Red"" Boyd. Ellis or Red as he preferred to be called in the film is Andy's best friend in prison. There are five main plot points in my opinion within this film. These points include when the inmates are betting on the new arrivals, when some of the inmates are re-tarring the roof on one of the buildings, when new library books finally arrive after all of Andy's attempts, and when the warden of Shawshank discovers that Andy has escaped. This films theme is similar to the retelling of the mythical story of ""Perseus"" by author Edith Hamilton. There are several techniques that were used throughout this film but a few really caught my attention. The first technique is a motif, this is the repeated showing of the crow that Brooks rescued and raised. The birds represent a hopefulness of freedom but it also represented the loss of hope after prison. When Brooks is released, he also sets ""Jake"" the crow free and continues to look for him in a park nearby hoping that he will return to him. However, when Jake does not return it represents the loss of hope in Brooks for life after prison. Another technique that attributed to the emotions of the film was the lighting aspects. In the scene after Andy escapes where he is standing in water while it is raining with his arms spread wide, the light is directed down on him with his back in the shadows. This lighting technique in this scene adds to the feeling of triumph, of hope and of freedom. This film absolutely reflects the feeling of hope onto the viewers."	10
 Best prison movie/buddy movie/escape flick ever.	Robbins kills as does Freeman. Amazing supporting cast. Everything is flawless from the camera work to the editing. Some might say that the side stories and other occasional story slowdowns drain it a bit but in my opinion these elements really only serve to better the buildup for what is maybe the greatest ending of a film ever. The location the film was shot in is also perfect and really adds to just how fun this movie is to watch. I wouldn't dare to tempt anyone with spoilers but if you haven't seen this movie then you are really missing a huge moment. Not just in cinema history. But also in terms of appreciating life. And freedom.	9
 Inspirational and Emotional..PURE DRAMA..	A tale that inspires and the emotions that never expires.. The story catches all our imaginations pertaining the character, as the story goes on it gets more deeper with good dialogues and well written,well delivered characters.. The actors have done the best job to bring out the emotions and making the movie more pleasing. watching it we get more attached to the characters. And more moved and inspired too..It lives up to its high rank and provides pure entertainment with honest approach.. A well scripted,well handled and well made one..A drama that keeps us into the story till the end of the Movie.. A perfect work from the director and the artists.A MUST WATCH FOR ALL...	9
 Fantastic! A must see for all generations.	What a film. How can I accreted describe something that I have watched over and over so many times? I watched this film with my parents as a young adult and loved it and now as I watch it 10 years later I find more things within the movie that speak to me. Lovely work here. The acting is impeccable and the story is compelling. This movie is like an onion, in that it has so many different layers and is so complex and yet, it is simple. I appreciate that AMC plays this movie frequently on their channel because it allows the masses of people who have cable television access to at least part of this film. Thank you for your contribution. It is truly a masterpiece that will transcend time.	10
 Best Prison Movie Ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	The Shawshank Redemption is a film of great passion and gritty script.I love the entire detail structure of the movie.Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.The simple yet hard to convey messages could not be handled more subtly than this.I have almost watched it more than 20 times. The Bond between the characters played by Morgan Freeman (Red) & Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) feels fabulous when you finishes the film.Script and Dialogues are top notch. Frank Darabont directs with genius and masterfully transcending the script and gives something definitively spectacular. Hope is so powerful that it can make great things happen.Just go for it ...	10
 Top movie!	One of the best movie in the world! To say, do not ever give up and there is always hope, however bleak the situation is. I'm very sorry that did not receive an Oscar, he really deserved, but it is what not alter the substance of. Everyone should see this item! Be exemplary for all people, so that they may live. Everyone is busy with their own problems, while not even know how you got bigger problems in the world. This movie shows that you should never rush to decide about it! You can always look at the man, he will stick with the story. Exposed to the director and the actors to do for all, we have seen excellent forming.As a final word: Do not give up, there is always hope!	10
 The only 10 stars movie	I first saw this movie on TV and quickly it captured me somehow. The next day I searched the entire city for a shop to buy this movie and watch it on DVD. I must say, when I watched it first, I felt like... this has to be the best movies of all times. I think I cam compare it with Schindler's list but somehow this is better. Now let's talk about the movie. This is movie is really dramatic in a way, but it motivates you somehow, the main character gives you that power to live more better your days, when you see him struggling in that crazy prison. As everyone, the main character needs a friend, to get over the worst thing in prison, and he gets Red (M. Freeman) who remains his buddy until the end. The movie also show us how a prisoner gets so used to the prison life, that after he can get out... he doesn't know what to do with his life anymore. After you see Shawshank Prison, you are thinking about life in another perspective... and after that, you fell like seeing this movie again... and again! Great movie, and 10 stars from me, maybe the only one with this grade.	9
 what we want		10
 Everything is top notch in this film		10
 That Movie	"One of the best movies I've ever seen, if not really the best. That ""Angel's Prison"" name in Romanian, I agree with it. It has marked my summer vacation last year, I thought about it very much, and how an innocent man can be punished for what he didn't do. I also liked his perseverance, and how he never gave up his ambition to become a free man, legally or not. The sad part was Brook's death, but I understood his decision and agreed with it. I also very much liked the way that Andy and Red bonded over the time Andy spent in prison, and the things he had done for the men in prison, like the library, and the courses he taught, and how he refused to give up his position, that moment when he played the music. A true ""Must See"" movie."	10
 Promising beginning,excellent story,pleasant ending	It's a pretty long movie of almost 3 hours of which 2.5 hours you shall simply be awed.How can a prison life based movie be this amazing? There is almost no action , no prison breaking(thats the 1st thing that comes to our mind when he hear about prison movies,is'not it?), no shitty scenes just pure drama at its best.You will cry at some moments and smile at some.Most of all ,from my experience of watching over a 1000 movies this is 1 of the very few movie which which could give a brilliant storyline to a good beginning.So watch this movie if you don't want to miss something brilliant in your life.Be a part of history.Thanks for reading!	10
 A movie that should be watched	One of the greatest movie ever I first doubt to watched it I didn't know how good it is then one day i played it and then after I watched it I realize that this is the best movie ever , Its a really good movie and it has a unbelievable story , and u never can guess what will happen in the end of the movie , that what i like in a movie , That I never could guess how this movie will end . Andy is a genius He's mind is brilliant and How he get in to jail , That what I love about this movie and he's stories in prison every thing that happens to him in prison is so interesting that make u want to see this movie many times , and the really good thing in this movie is that beautiful and clever plan of Andy . At first u r looking at a simple guy who owns a bank but at the end you are looking at a genius who is owns a great mind .	10
 One of the best movies of all time	"If you're in the mood for a good movie based on a true story that takes place during a seemingly simpler time and played by really great actors, then this movie is a good choice. A man wrongly accused of murdering his wife is sent to prison where he meets his new life long best friend, Red. It is the type of movie that pulls you in close so that you can't help but to like these ""criminals"". It's not often that any movie good or bad has a good ending. This movie has a very good ending and leaves you with the answers you were looking for. You laugh, cry (or at least feel like you might),get mad and cheer for the good guys and the mild mannered sarcasm. A man who never should have been in prison in the first place ended up making it a much better place, exposed tax scam, educated others, provided tax advice, made life long friends, developed allies and THEN receives his redemption. It's a battle of wits, showing of strength and endurance of pain (emotional & physical) throughout the movie. I have never met anyone who hasn't absolutely loved this movie."	10
 A film about patience and resilience.	A film about patience and resilience. Everything in life with determination and planning can be done. Good script and good fluidity. Justice is not always done ... but there will always be a way out. Tim Robins and Morgan freeman show good chemistry. The story is verisimilitude, without being too fanciful. Certainly good public acceptance, it is no wonder that it is the first on IMDb. Got good reviews. It's an optimistic film that shows us the good side of perseverance and calm. Nothing's desperation to end well ... as good conquers evil ... if it is strong enough for this. Although slight, for a film of prison, known to be strong when needed. Excellent movie.	9
 really who think this movie is awesome but there is something weird why no body ask about the people inside the jail	i watched 10 times but i think they was should recording outside of jail maybe one of the people had a family asking about him or some visitors to jail.. that's will give the movie more reality and when he got out why he did not go to the real killer of her wife? and he had so smart but why he did not tell his friend about run out of jail at last and why he did not marry another woman after he got out? and the man who hang his self how his name still in the roof? and how the black man found his friend name in the roof? how the put him in the same room ? the movie is SO AWESOME but not enough for me im sorry i don't mean any thing about the actors	10
 Its not just a movie.....	"The character Andy have so much influence on me that I wanted to pack my bag to Zihuatanejo and play chess with him... I hope the pacific should be blue for me as well.""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"" that's god damn right. Stephen King's words were so powerful that it exactly replicates the strength of the human mind. Not a man with normal head can create such a master piece. Frank Darabont was no less to Stephen King, he exactly created the character with few directorial touches.The narration was so adorable that the entire movie was well executed by Andy's Colleague. The best words were the final few from Andy ""Hope is a good thing, may be the best of things and no good thing ever dies ....."" If you truly admire human spirit, I bet you will produce some chemical changes in your body.... I cannot say anything about Andy, well he is far beyond my imagination.Well I can write for months about this movie but its not a essay writing, just a review, so I'm stopping now. I hope this movie will be screened in big screens again and I will get chance to watch it in big screen"	10
 Hope is the best thing....	I saw this movie in 2006 wen I was in college...midnight I was watching this movie... Before this movie I might have seen 100s of movies but never a movie this powerful. A story about Hope, Friendship, Redemption. This movie goes deep into u...it touches Ur soul and u feel real freedom. I always make it a point to watch this movie once or twice a year... It keeps me motivated. Morgan freeman, Tim Robbins and every other character are class. Even after a century this movie will always remember for its acting and will always be a real Hollywood gem. There are so many scenes in the movie one can relate to. Even with no Oscar this movie is worth more than a y Oscar winner. We all are Red searching for people like Andy to get our Redemption!	10
 A Must-see	I sat down at my home and watched this film with my father the other day and I was expecting greatness. However, what I received was near perfection. Everything from the cinematography to plot was spectacular. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as the leading roles of this classic. The story of Andy's struggle with corruption and Red's words of wisdom to Andy along the way make the movie quite the beautiful tale. It's a shame that this Stephen King adaptation couldn't have won the academy award for best picture in 1994. It was just a tough year for movies. If you haven't seen this film yet I implore you to put it at the top of your must watch list.	10
 This is a superb movie.	I have never seen such a film, the story is undoubtedly one of the best ever seen, it's just evil with a mixture of thriller and action ... This leads us away leaves room for our imagination , the development of our common sense ... It's just a philosophical bunch of crap , so bad that I almost vomit , you dare call it a masterpiece ? Let me laugh , it's just a mixture of children's stories , never seen before ... I was reading some reviews and there by chance I came across this film, they say he had an Oscar and all the trimmings . Excuse my subjectivity , but I could not stand this movie , I was bored so I stopped watching in the middle ... How could you look at this epic fail ? This is just to die laughing. I want to say that I found the game player shabby and staging is worse ... The director deserves banishment for life of art to have released such a MASTERPIECE ! Thank you , thank you everyone , I love you <3	10
 The story of friendship, loyalty, hope and wisdom		10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'."" The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles? People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well.There wasn't much going for it: It had a terrible title, it was a ""prison drama"" and women don't like those, it contained almost no action, it starred actors who were respected but not big stars, and it was long at 142 minutes. Polls and rentals reflect popularity but don't explain why people value ""Shawshank"" so fervently. Maybe it plays more like a spiritual experience than a movie. It does have entertaining payoff moments (as when the guards from another prison, wearing their baseball uniforms, line up to have Andy do their taxes). But much of the movie involves quiet, solitude, and philosophical discussions about life. The moments of violence (as when Andy is sexually assaulted) are seen objectively, not exploited.The movie avoids lingering on Andy's suffering; after beatings, he's seen in medium and long shot, tactfully. The camera doesn't focus on Andy's wounds or bruises, but, like his fellow prisoners, gives him his space.The Morgan Freeman character is carrier of the film's spiritual arc. We see him at three parole hearings, after 20, 30 and 40 years. The first hearing involves storytelling trickery; the film has opened with Andy's sentencing, and then we see a parole board, and expect it's about to listen to Andy's appeal. But, no, that's when we first see Red. In his first appeal he tries to convince the board he's been rehabilitated. In the second, he just goes through the motions.There's an underlying problem. Behind bars, Red is king. He's the prison fixer, able to get you a pack of cigarettes, a little rock pick or a Rita Hayworth poster. On the outside, he has no status or identity. We've already seen what happened to the old librarian (James Whitmore), lonely and adrift in freedom.Frank Darabont wrote and directed the film, basing it on a story by Stephen King. His film grants itself a leisure that most films are afraid to risk. The movie is as deliberate, considered and thoughtful as Freeman's narration. There's a feeling in Hollywood that audiences have short attention spans and must be assaulted with fresh novelties.Tim Robbins makes Andy a man of few words, quietly spoken. He doesn't get real worked up. He is his own man, capable of keeping his head down for years and then indulging in a grand gesture, as when he plays an aria from Mozart's ""The Marriage of Figaro."" (The overhead shot of the prisoners in the yard, spellbound by the music, is one of the film's epiphanies.) Because he does not volunteer himself, reach out to us or overplay his feelings, he becomes more fascinating: It is often better to wonder what a character is thinking than to know.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."	10
 Increable, Amazing, Life changing	This movie blow my mind, i love the character of Andy and his friend Red, i like the he overcome his problems and keep in mind his goal freedom. Love how he make all the plan to brake out form jail. i think is really cool the as always all runaways go and hide in Mexico. Like the idea of going to Zihuatanejo beach and build a ship and go travel all pacific Mexican cost. Andy was a really Smart man and i think this move shows how you can pass all bad things in life if you have a goal, and look for it. The only i didn't like was the fact the nobody prove the Andy was Innocent of killing his wife. or maybe he did, i think Andy find out the she was cheating on him and he plan the crime with the same method he plan his scape of prison, who knows?	
 nice	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.t is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.

 This is a truly the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. Highly recommended!	Parents need to know that this movie is rated R for a reason: The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Two characters have sex (their clothes are on, and it's not graphic), one lovable character hangs himself, guards shoot an inmate and frame it as an escape attempt, inmates attempt and, we are told, succeed in raping Andy, and guards beat and kill an inmate in the opening scenes. But the film also shows inmates forming a loving community of friendship and support despite oppressive conditions.This is a truly the most beautiful movie i've ever seen. Highly recommended!	10
 Something Deep to loon into!!!	The Shawshank Redemption..What can i say it is one of the most amazing movies ever made.The cast is amazing and the characters suit each and everyone of the star.Morgan Freeman did an amazing job as always as a narrator and on of the cast member.He is in his all time deep words and quotes.The main role done by Tim Robbins is too good.One of the most deep characters of all time and Tim Robbins doing such an amazing job,He made me feel the character.One of the best movies and acting's of all time. I strongly prefer this movie to people who love to see someone act and look into an awesome story,this is such an amazing piece of art	10
 One of the greatest	Well-acted, well-directed, powerful and thought-provoking, The Shawshank Redemption encompasses all of the above, as it tells the incredibly inspiring story of friendship and hope. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine in their roles as inmates who develop a remarkable bond during their imprisonment, facing the struggles of prison life together and ultimately finding redemption. Although it focuses on a very familiar theme, The Shawshank Redemption stands out from the rest of the films in its genre, mainly due to the extremely intimate portrayal of its characters it has to offer. The film successfully uses its prison setting as a lens for society, and manages to present the audience with important life lessons throughout the storyline. Although not designed as a film of epic proportions, its nature does have an immense emotional impact on the viewer, which makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time.	10
 Wonder full		8
 Cool Movie	This movie title is nothing like the movie. Keep in mind that the movie was based on a book by Stephen King. For a fan of King this is not something that you would expect. The movie has very little action in it, but is about true redemption, which is not revealed until the end of the movie. Personally I love this movie. The way that the cast interacts with each other is really what gives this movie the flare that you need. The prison that it was filmed at is a real prison located in Mansfield, Ohio. It can actually be toured by the general public, as can other aspects of the movie. This is a definite must see movie for anyone who wants something that will make them think about what is important in life.	10
 The Best Movie ever	"I have seen the movie first and than read the book and especially in this case, I think it was the right order. I love every moment in the movie, it was made in a very good way. Excellent cast, director and photographer. This is my favorite movie. I watch this movie at least twice in every year and still love it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins brilliantly play in it. They were very good choices for these characters - even they are look like totally different as the book's characters. I think they really enjoy to play their movie characters. Before I have seen this movie someone said to me, it is only a newer ""prison story"". Yes, basically it is ""only"" a prison story. But there is nothing similar to The Shawshank Redemption! I can offer this movie to anyone who like well written stories with very good acting and very good directing."	10
 Simplicity at it's finest	If you want to sit back with a bowl of popcorn and be entertained by one of the greatest movies to ever grace the screen. Well you have found it here. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman should tell you everything you need to know, if you want to know how the acting is, to put it simply, It is nothing short of Fantastic. The movie hits like a king-maker right from the get go, and just doesn't let you go until the final credits roll.The direction the movie takes may feel predictable to most, but it is well worth it.Sit back and enjoy.	9
 Nice	Has to be the best prison movie ever. Yes, it's even better than the Green Mile. I've been putting off watching this movie forever, thinking it was going to be boring and sappy. But it's far from it. This movie wraps you up in its story and it always feels very real due to superb filmmaking. The acting couldn't get any better, and in the end this is one of the most uplifting movies ever made. Yes it's very long, but it without a doubt justifies its length.Based on the Stephen King novel by the same name, it's simply the best movie ever made, it should had won best picture in 1994, and all characters performances are incredible. If you haven't watch it, just do it without thinking about it twice.	10
 Top Movie!	This is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life. I think I was 14 years the first time I saw it. Mamma tell us a little for me before I got to cuddle me down on the couch and watch a movie for over 2 hours - That it has with little trouble and jail to do. After I saw the movie I wanted it to continue. Wish in the future to it will continue. You'll see how 'Red' experience meeting along with Andy Dufresne. You get to see how they manage the prison with fractions, friendship & grief. Or what happens to the 'Red' & Andy's friends. Think it would make a great blow through all categories of stellar top! I have even heard of me to Castle Rock & other to give them a tip about making a new sequel.	
 Love this	Great movie. Very upsetting at points though, if you ever been to jail or know someone that went to jail thats close to you it tends to hit home. But overall, that's really the point. It really shows what can happen in jail, and how people can be falsely accused. i've watched this movie to many times but still love it so its one of those kind of movies really. but its good to pay attention to everything or it gets confusing. i didn't really pay attention the first time i watched it i don't think, and i kept asking questions throughout the whole movie because didn't know what was going on. i very well recommend this movie to people of all age groups because it truthfully it can even teach you a lesson to stay away from certain things.	10

 review		10
 Brilliant	"One of the best movies I have ever seen! A brilliant performance, a life story and the perseverance of achieving your goals! A story about a man imprisoned for killing his wife becomes the true example of the saying that ""not the strongest or the most intelligent survives, survives the one who adapts"". An intelligent person that takes patience and perseverance on this way to freedom. A very calculated plan of escape that takes place over a number of years. A movie that I see every time with that same passion and pleasure. And the voice of Morgan Freeman always makes me feel in the middle of the story with every emotional state that comes with it."	10
 about the movie	"really its a great movie.......... It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.

It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."	10
 A good Film		8
 Excellent Movie	This movie is excellent , it is not only an example of utmost focus and effort put by an innocent person to archive his aim. I have gone through The Count of Monte Cristo ; after reading the book of course, that also is inline in some way with the movie; also Escape is one of its kind; The sharpness of mind and the direction or goal through which the hero goes gives sharp example of focus and patience. Shawshank Redemption is The Best movie of all , best part perhaps is the discovery of the tunnel, it is and will be one of my most favored and beloved movies.Only sad part is that I don't see movies like these in air frequently, also could only know the name of the movie through a friend of mine.	10
 Robbins and Freeman	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in the same movie. Does one need to say more? Morgan Freeman leads this all star cast on and interesting journey of the 1930's to 1950's prison system.The story has been told is such a way that you feel as if you are actually there to see the events take place.There are tears of joy and laughter, tears of sadness at the injustice.This is a movie that requires some patience but have no fear if you pay attention the twists and turns will be plain to see.Tim Robbins is magnificent as a jilted husband who is wrongly accused of his wife's murder.Morgan Freeman is there a movie in which this man doesn't do well in? He is brilliant as an old con who is in Shawshank for murder.Overall this is a brilliant movie and delivers on all counts.	9
 Classic	"This is a must watch movie in every once life,love it.. the reviews which are ahead are as good as the movie... every frame in the movie has its meaning. one can think easily that even though movie came on to the screen two decades earlier it is still no:1 in its position i personally created this account to give my rating and write a review on such a wonderful film. i felt very happy after watching this film and i thought of sharing with you. finally i want to say that ""entertainment is there ever corner of our life. but meaning of the true life lies with in this movie"". this movie give a valuable message ""if we want a thing really & actually from the heart then every force on this earth will try to help us..but the only thing we have to do is never loose HOPE"""	9
 Just amazing...	I definitely loved this movie to bits. From the start, i had know idea what was going to happen nor how it would end. During the movie it was understandable, enjoyable and original. When i say Original i mean its like something i haven't seen nor experienced. Actors pretty basic, i wouldn't ague about it, but the 21st century would. Its a great movie, i would watch it over and over and i would never get bored of it.None should hate this movie, in my opinion its a excellent choice to watch and deserves a big 10/10loved it!	10
 The best forever...	I apologize to you for my bad English. This is the most amazing movie I watched. Bondage and freedom, has been described in an incredible way. Good movies gather them in the last 30 years, the number 30 does not. I was very impressed with the intelligence of screenwriter. This event is real or not, but the film is absolutely fantastic. I am a Turk. So, ten lines write is too hard. Anyway, for this successful film, I want to thank everyone who contributed. Made me happy, I feel my life has added something. I never get bored and watch over and over again. I think it may forever remain in the TOP250 list. Because, this film beyond time.. ooh I finally finished..	10
 A poignant story		10
 For me, the best movie ever made	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" isn't a sad story, although you may think it is. There is a lot of feelings in it, like life and humor, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about sustain a sense of personal value, notwithstanding everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. I truly recommend that you watch this movie, because, for me, is the best movie ever made"	10
 This is one of my favorite films of all time	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are inspirational as Andy and Red. I have seen this movie about 30 times, maybe more. This film is full of surprises. It keeps you guessing about Andy's guilt until the end. The prison escape reminded me of the Count of Monte Cristo so it was especially funny that this Dumas book was mentioned in the movie. It is a great film about institutionalization. It also is a good representation of prison life in its time period. It would make a great film to watch for a Criminal Justice class. This is a must see movie for anyone who thinks their life has turned out bad. It can always be worse.In Andy's case it was.	10
 Possibly The Best King Movie Ever!	"The plot is very creative. The part when Andy finally escapes and throughout the whole movie he digging a tunnel to escape. I also enjoy the parody on the TV show ""Family Guy"". If you have Netflix check it out. The episode is called ""Three Kings"". It also contains wonderful parody's of King's other wonderful work ""Misery"", ""Stand by Me"", and also hints at the masterpiece ""The Shining"". They do a great job on ""Shawshank"" and the rest of the stories and they stick to the story lines and change so few very things. Just a few names (To fit the TV show) and a little of the story line to spice things up and make less depressing and little more funny. King is at his best here and has only reached this kind of high point few times before."	10
 Incredible	This have to be one of the best movies I have ever seen with excellent actors and the best plot! You will never forget this movie after you have watched this. The story is so real that you are gonna believe it is based on a true story, even though it is not. The bad thing about writing this review is that the reader right away will have too high expectations and that is almost never a good thing. But this movie has really got in to me, and is the one I always recommend first when people ask me for movie-recommendations. The move is exciting, funny and it will not disappoint you. Watch this, you will not feel like you have wasted 142 minutes - trust me!	10
 awesome	what a movie..! amazing chemistry.The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King.	9
 A movie that transcends all barriers	I will not summarize the plot as it's all in other reviews. But I do want to say that this is probably the most inspiring and one of the greatest movies ever made. It cuts across all gender, race, socio- economic, religious and any other barriers you can think of. I do not know one person who has seen SR and has not been affected by it. I've heard about all the actors who were considered for the roles of Andy and Red and I cannot think of anyone else in them but Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, they were so good. Everyone involved in this movie was excellent. Every once in a while I will pull out the DVD and just watch the last 30 minutes to be encouraged. This movie is for everyone.	10
" More then just a ""Prison Movie"""		10
 Loved Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins Performance	This review contains spoilers, so spoiler alert!!! This film draws you in from the very beginning; from Tim Robins character coming home catching his wife cheating, to her being murdered. The theme is similar to the movie the Fugitive to me, the only difference was in the film the Fugitive, Harrison Fords character ran in the beginning, in Shaw Shank Redemption, Tim Robins Character runs towards the end, after he suffers abuse being locked up with hardened criminals in prison. I felt sorry for Tim Robins character being falsely accused and having to suffer rape, false imprisonment and lost years. One stand out theme to me in watching this film is you can imprison the man, but you cannot imprison his mind. Tim Robins Character was locked up for years but his mind was free, instead of living inside the prison, Tim Robins Character lives inside his head remembering he is good with numbers and accounting and living inside his head instead of his bad circumstances was his characters saving grace in this film. I would definitely recommend people watch this movie. If you are going through pain, sometimes it helps to see other people going through stuff more worse than you and survive, become a victor instead of a victim, and for that this is my favorite Tim Robins film. Morgan Freeman, was Morgan Freeman, even as a supporting cast he made you feel his presence, his voice, the way he chooses his words makes you can't take your eyes off him. He makes you feel his pain and his friendship with Tim Robins Character. This is a film I can see myself watching again and again when I'm having a bad day. Hope this review helps. Now go watch this movie.	10
 Shashank Redemption	This film was very inspirational and spiritual and I really enjoyed it. It truly demonstrated how difficult life was back then. It was well written and well produced. The acting that was demonstrated was tremendous. I truly enjoyed watching this film. The film Shawshank Redemption conveys to the audience the image of hope in the worst possible situation. Through the themes and the cinematic decisions applied in these two episodes the director has made these vital to the understanding of the movie. He has given two examples of the extreme situations to which prisoners go depending on their emotions. One of the emotions is yet one of the main themes of the movie, hope, and in my opinion it has been brought up extremely effectively.	10
 Film Review - Spoilers		
 Excellent Movie all together	Simply dumbstruck an no wonder why this movie tops the IMDb List for these long years. Its simple awesome to look at the simplicity and the screen play. The best casting and acting. At some point of time I started to look around and realized that I am still at my home. No odd scenes, dialog, character).. My only concern is why its 9.2/10 ( why is the remaining(.8)% of people voted below 10?, because they are called as Morons....The best part is that, the director or the film crew is not so greedy to shoot a prequel or sequel after the massive success of this film. Hats off, and that is the real victory of the movie. This is my first review and I am forced to write 10 Lines of text.Sorry guys!!	10
 MasterPiece	"When I saw this movie , I really become a fan . what a story and how it is composed this is awesome. The lesson of the story is too wide that when you actually do something with zeal and zest then you can achieve it. Morgan Freeman , what a actor he is.Tim Robbins, one of our best, most casual, young actors, plays a banker in the 1940's who is falsely sent to Shawshank Prison for the death of his wife and her lover. In this maximum security penitentiary, Robbins is harassed by the warden, beaten by guards, and sexually abused by inmates. The first and best friend he makes is the elder statesman of the yard, a long time convict played by the great Morgan Freeman. Over time, Robbins will make other friends, some of whom will be absolutely paralyzed by freedom in the straight world. Even better than ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates the world of overbearing closure that is prison."	10

 One of the best movies	this is one of the greatest movies of all time. in my opinion its the second best movie ever. everything is great about this movie the only thing i hate about this movie are the many clichés. like the maggot he found in his food the prison rapes, black-white guy friendship. every scene is perfectly shot. the acting is perfect. the story is brilliant. and every character is perfectly developed. i recommend every French and Germany dude to watch this movie in the Original language. it may be not you're favorite genre, but you can't deny that this is a great movie. i agree it is a bit overrated but thats not a reason to give this movie 1/10. if you rate this movie below 8 you're not human.	8
 A must watch: Patience vs Impatience	This is an excellent work. For a movie that doesn't have much drama, but has so realistic details, I was captivated. The performances are epic. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman has done one of the finest work of acting. The plot was not the most unique or unusual, but the work was Homeric, by that I mean it is monumental. This is one of those movies that will put you to think, that how patience can yield you fruits and how impatience and wrath can put you to jail. His anger made him do something (though he didn't do it) but he did act towards killing his wife, which lead him to jail. And later the patience was the only key for success, and he did manage to get away from that jail.by working hard for it. A must watch.	10
 Good yarn but not a very good film	I get nightmares where I think Morgan Freeman is narrating in my head and I can't turn him off. For me, his condescending delivery which peels back of the top layer of the man onion, defines this film, and so it starts to lose me a bit. This is a really good story but so much of the film is made up of episodes of over the top male bonding. I find it astonishing that it rates so highly to be honest. I also have a problem with the plethora of goofs. Why do the contents of an atmospheric sewerage line explode upon the breaking of its pipe with a brick? Like that would work anyway. And why place a boat that you want to paint paint right on the edge of the sea as the moment the tide comes in it will simply float away? And how did our protagonist get the poster stuck back once he went through his escape tunnel in the wall? There are so many stupid parts to it. I enjoyed it generally though, as I say its a good yarn - but the best film ever! Best film ever for males with IQs under 80 perhaps. I could believe that.	6
 The best movie ever!!	I had heard a lot about the movie before seeing it..And I would wonder what would be so great about a prison movie.. But now after seeing it, i can say it is the best movie I've ever seen.. This is how movies should be.. And it proves that no special effects, technology, costumes, locations can substitute for good story and acting. I have never been so moved or influenced by any movie as I have by this one..It leaves you with a sense of happiness and deep satisfaction.. It is a thought provoking and emotionally uplifting movie which teaches us so much about life, hope, friendship..It has some memorable lines which really create an impact.. Acting by all actors is top notch.. Too sad the movie did not win a single Oscar.. The no.1 spot on IMDb is very well deserved.. It is timeless classic which will be remembered for years to come.	10
 Love movie	Talk about not getting it. The clue to just how badly the reviewer missed lies in the title. The theme is REDEMPTION, not hope or sentimental treacle or the evils of capital punishment and Rush Limbaugh. Further, it's a FANTASY, as close to Neal Gaiman as Stephen King has ever come. (Hint: Fantasies aren't supposed to be real.) Nor is Andy Dufresne a Cooperesque character. Rather, he is written as diffident, difficult, and entirely unlovable at first blush. See my next. All these comments are funny. I'm glad Glieberman wrote this review. Everything he says about this overrated piece of goop is true. It IS sentimental and exploitative, and makes prison seem trivial; who cares about the rape if eventually I'll be redeemed, Hollywood style? The characters are thinly portrayed, and it has little connection with grit or honesty. Along with Forrest Gump and Gone With The Wind, one of the most overpraised movies ever made.	7
 One of the best movies I've ever watched		10
 inspiring...	I voted 10 out of 10. This movie is truly inspiring. For me, the movie says NEVER GIVE UP and WHEN THERE IS A WILL, THERE IS A WAY. The actors portrayed their roles very well. I cannot believe it didn't do well the way it should have compared to some non sense box office movies.I admired the kind of friendship Andy and Red had. I also admired the way Andy made his way to earn the trust of the jail guards and fellow inmates. He is indeed an intelligent man and he used it to gain something that he needed to free himself. I wish I have that kind of intelligence and persistence.The ending is really heartwarming. Seeing two old friends meeting again and ready to start over again. It is just sad that ex-cons are not given the chance to start over nowadays.	10
 It was said its the best movie	I loved that movie. I heard a lot of thing about the film but its better than I thought. Everybody have to take a look then they cant get their eyes off it...When it start you consider it a ordinary movie. But story is so touched. If you are an emotional person you cant help your tears anymore. There are The successful performances first the starring Morgin Freeman and the another stars. It looks a desperate story but after a half hour you can see hopeful movie. You even feel hopeful and optimist when you finish the movie. And Its has the best final... You can see the darkness side of jail and you can see old men living a child inside, a child inside and never let him die . When you feel worst when you have no more choice you have yourself your hope and make your own destiny. It was the message that I had from that movie...	10
 Best movie of all time	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 excellent		9
 the story of Andy Dufresne		8
 10/10	"Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."	10
 Simply amazing	This movie was the perfect example of those who have patience, and the will to move forward, and fight for what you believe in shall always prevail. Maybe not right then when you want it but it shall happen. Regardless of the plot he went and did what he had to and never once lost his wits and his will. The actors were amazing and one of my favorites in Morgan freeman once again did his thing in capturing the character, and just drawing you into the movie itself. It's Amazing how things from back then, still somewhat hasn't changed in this time era. Maybe someday our judicial system will change for the better who knows. Yet for right now we do with what we have and hope and pray it changes for the better. Awesome awesome movie that I have seen countless times.	10
 the best movie i have seen in my life	it is a movie which got me involved into it gradually. It didn't dazzle me just from the beginning or made me fell fantasy all the time. But, as soon as i finished the movie, it seemed that i just lived a life of the characters. The story is moved with a character of a banker,Andy Dufresne , who was punished to go into Shawshank prison and his life there. He meets a person called Red there who is another main character in the movie. As the story go further it introduces new things of his prison life and keep interested in the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did a brilliant job,who are the main roles Andy Dufresne and Red in the movie.Besides, other actors were good as well. I felt the same feeling when I watched 'Forest Gump',which is also a favorite movie of mine. Finally, I just love the movie and would like to advise everyone to watch it.	10
 about this film		9
 Great movie	"'The Shawshank Redemption' is a brilliant adaptation, if only because Darabont has some quintessential scenes added. So Andy locks himself inside the library, while he plays opera music all over the courtyard. In another sequence Darabont shows the suicide of an old freed prisoner who cant get used to the outside world. There are some smaller changes to the characters. Both in the book and the film Tommy Williams is the young rascal who tells Andy who really killed his wife. Andy gets excited and gets a month of solitary confinement, but in the move Williams is murdered.The film is quite a gem. He tastes like freedom on a silver blue bird. Freedom on a hot summer day. Freedom as ""wander around the prison grounds like you can go to a cocktail party at anytime "" Freedom after forty years' imprisonment. 'The Shawshank Redemption' colors the most morbid mind blue. The color of the sea, The color of Andy's freedom."	9
 Best movie!	One of my favorite movie. There are several words can be use to describe this movie : fantastic, excellent, perfect..I love every details in this film. This movie contains such incredible actors and actresses so it's already attractive to me.Well i'm speechless to talk about this movie and i only can say that this is the ONE, this is the movie that you're looking for..When I first watched this film I'm immediately suck into the story of the film and i felt into it right away. Iwas such an extraordinary memory and I will never forget it. If you haven't seen this movie well you should watch it right now. It's worth it !	10
 General Aspects	"Amazing Film really loved it, would highly recommend the film to someone who hasn't watched it great acting, amazing storyline, great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman. I'm not really into prison movies that much but this is the best by far! great drama a must watch!. Firstly, its setting. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This is an amazing piece of architecture, strong and Gothic in design. Immediately, the prison becomes a character. It casts its shadow over most of the film, its tall stone walls stretching above every shot. It towers over the men it contains, blotting out all memories of the outside world. Only Andy (Robbins) holds onto hope. It's in music, it's in the sandy beaches of Zihuatanejo; ""In here's where you need it most,"" he says. ""You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a - there's a - there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch."" Red (Morgan Freeman) doesn't think much of Andy at first, picking ""that tall glass o' milk with the silver spoon up his ass"" as the first new fish to crack. Andy says not a word, and losing his bet, Red resents him for it. But over time, as the two get to know each other, they quickly become the best of friends. This again, is one of the film's major strengths. Many movies are about love, many flicks have a side-kick to the hero, but Shawshank is the only one I can think of that looks honestly at the love between two best friends. It seems odd that Hollywood would skip this relationship time and again, when it's a feeling that weighs so much into everyone's day to day lives. Perhaps it's too sentimental to seem conventional, but Shawshank's core friendship hits all the right notes, and the film is much better for it."	10
 I even have a book that was in the library in the movie as a prop!!	"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE movie ever. My children (whom also love it) will not watch it with me because I say the lines all the way through. I LOVE Morgan Freeman's voice, just something very comforting to me, like home. The part where Red is describing how Andy got out just fills my heart and to see Andy's smile at the end bring it full circle! If you like this I would suggest: Murder in the First (Kevin Bacon) and The Last Castle (Robert Redford) both very different even though they are prison based and same era based movies they go in different directions. I do not live very far from the prison in SR. My mom did some kind of day trip/tour there and bought a small hard bound book that had been used as a prop in the library scene (just sitting on the shelf with others not actually ""used"" in the movie)"	10
 Andy has some initial difficulty adjusting to prison life, especially because many of the other prisoners think he's a snob.		9
 A good Morgan Freeman movie!	The Shawshank Redemption 'Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.'So let me get straight to the point! Me searching for a good Morgan Freeman movie as you know he is a good actor and I've near enough watched every movie that he has been in. The tag-line said it all really 'Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.' especially the ending scene where red found the letter quoting 'hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies... your friend Andy.'The movie has absolutely got to be one of my favourite movies. The acting was superb. The story-line was great. The filming was good. You just have to give credit to the director Frank Darabont for doing such an excellent job.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is A Great Movies	"Besttechcars.com - Nice movie and great action is one of the starts The Shawshank Redemption. I think it should be shown again for us. how can i takes this good movies is how to learn in this action. but there are so many talking time that i am still making bored. It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. thanks. IMDb. Click here www.besttechcars.com"	10
 10/10	I have one word for this movie:brilliant! Everything in this movie just works. If you didn't watch it yet,you are missing out!You have no reason not to watch it. I myself watched it about 6 times now,and my god i can never get bored of it. It is one of the best movie of all times,and to be honest,it's best prison movie of all time.That i can guarantee you! It's brilliantly directed,has some great actors,and for me it's the best story ever told on film. Over all a great experience.It truly is one of the finest movie made.That's about it.I have nothing bad to say about this movie as you probably figured out that by now :).	10
 Great	"The whole movies are incredible but you'd hate the ending... Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cell-block. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two."	9
 One of the most absorbing movies I have ever watched	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. Each and every element of the movie comes together to form an exquisite cinematic story.Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) has played his part to perfection and is well complimented by Morgan Freeman (Ellis ""Red"" Redding). Frank Darabont masterfully entwines fate, courage, fear, hardship, friendship, dreams and above all HOPE into one truly enticing cinematic experience. The various phases in the movie are shown with so much emotion that it gives the viewer a sense of being actually there at that moment. The movie was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 but walked away with none which was very disheartening."	10
 Well deserved	OK, so before i get started i'd like to say that in my personal top 50, this would probably make it in about the 40-45 mark, this wouldn't be in the top 10's, 20's or 30's because of personal taste, nostalgia factor etc etc. (and i've seen too many films to know).All i'll say is that this film deserves the #1 spot (on IMDb), the story, characters are some of cinemas most realistic and the last 3rd, leaves you high on hopes and great heartfelt joy. This made me even shed a few tears.I'm very pleased i saw this film, and respect it as it should be, one of the all time best.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"One of the finest films ever made, it has a storyline based on the power of friendship. The film is about Two imprisoned men and how they bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. It is a beautifully made film and credit should be given to director and writer Frank Darabont. The acting masterclass of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins helps create a heart-wrenching friendship as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) struggles to cope in Shawshank Prison as he has been wrongly accused for his wife's murder. In steps ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman) a man who knows how to get things who befriends Andy and learns about his story. This is one of my all-time favourites and rightly so. It is one that everyone should watch, a film where grit and determination, mixed with true friendship, always helps you prevail in the most difficult of situations."	9

 A Legendary Movie!	A classic suspenseful film with one of the more clever stories that I've ever seen. It's even more surprising it was written by Stephen King. He's well known for his horror stories but this was completely different from his usual work of masterpieces. It is a definite must watch on your list. Tim Robbins has a performance of a lifetime and this movie propelled Morgan Freeman to the superstar he is today. A lot of twist and turns in the plot and all the supporting characters were amazing as well. Even with the bad guys, you really do invest each and every one of them and the film just builds truly memorable characters through the whole movie. It definitely goes down as one the most classic films ever made.	9
 Entertainment	It's a well executed movie with a wholesome message. It falls more in to the category of movies with lots of heart and good performances. Besides the warden and Freeman and Robbins, the performances were adequate but forgettable. The reason I gave it a six is because it's not really challenging. It is conventional as far as style and content. This is not a bad thing because it does use convention effectively. Clearly the movie has touched a lot of people. It is more effective than the source material in terms of getting it's point across. The Stephen King short story did not have as much impact and the embellishments that Frank Darabont added (like the sewer scene) definitely added to the emotional content of the story.	6
 Loved this Movie		8
 All Time Great Movie		10
 the best	one of the best movies i have seen so far...... it keeps u intact with the movie and motivates to not give up on your life... the life has not ended yet..... one can always learn to pick themselves up... all you need is to have a backup and you can live peacefully your upcoming life in any part of the world without hiding.... as for the main character, he has played the role from his heart and it suits him the role .... as of Morgan freeman he is an excellent actor who bought a life in the characters life. if there had been any other actor in place of him the role would have gone in vain but, Morgan freeman- hats off.. this is a must watch movie by any age group of people and will definitely motivate you towards the way of living	9
 very nice	very nice movie i liked it very much, it hold me all the time in tension! i liked all the characters and Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors, especially after this movie its a great movie i recommend to anyone who hasn't watched it to do it because it is one very moving movie with numerous amazing scenes it is one not to be missed we live one life so this should be watched usually freeman makes only good and moving movies but this is one of his best so i am glad i watched it i didn't lose my time and i look forward to more movies like this and more movies with the great one Morgan Freeman, it was truly amazing stuff keep it up	8
 Greatest movie ever made. PERIOD.		10
 good	this movie is great thank you all cast thanks for freeman good job good luck man i'm from Iran 1 more good luck for all castis an American actor, film director, and narrator. Freeman has received Academy Award nominations for his performances in Street Smart, Driving Miss Daisy, The Shawshank Redemption and Invictus, and won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 2005 for Million Dollar Baby. He has also won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award. Freeman has appeared in many other box office hits, including Unforgiven, Glory, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Seven, Deep Impact, The Sum of All Fears, Bruce Almighty, Along Came a Spider, The Dark Knight trilogy, March of the Penguins and The Lego Movie. He is known for his distinctively smooth, deep voice. He got his first break as part of the cast of The Electric Company.	9
 almost great	Amazing story, great characters and very good actors. But only thing that i didn't like was make-up, for example Andy gets 20 years older but that chief guard doesn't older at all and same goes other characters. Location is great, one of the best movie prisons i ever seen. So that is reason why i didn't give a ten, but 9,5 would appropriate. This film definitely deserved at least 3-4 Oscars. Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published. Best Actor in a Supporting Role nomination at least. Finnish name for this movie terrible, it spoils the entire movie. One of the greatest stories of all time, you have see this.	9
 One of The Best Movies Ever	One of the best movies that I've seen for a long time. Although for me The Godfather is the best movie of all time. But, this movie has a great unique story which makes it so interesting.I really like this movie, because it does show you that the system can make a mistake just like everyone can. All people make mistakes and since the government is run by humans of course there are going to be flaws. I had watched this movie for the first time with my dad and I loved watching it since. It does show that when you are determined you can do anything you put your mind to. I think anyone who likes movies about prison or even about the judicial system will love this film.	10
 Then and Now	When this movie was released on video, yes VHS, my brother told my mom to watch it. So my mother asked me to watch it with her, most of the stuff she had me watch were all good but I heard how long it was. I was hesitant at first. I thought I would be bored as hell. After the movie was over I could not believe how good it was. One of my favorites then and remains in my top 5 movies today. If anybody hasn't seen the movie then... 1) Where the hell have you been? Living under a rock? 2) Watch it already! The direction, acting, locations and everything about this film is just amazing. Brings a huge smile to my face whenever this movie comes on.	10
 Meticulously powerful film		
 Best Film Ever Made	"Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes and the story unfolds from thereThe Shawshank Redemption is an aesthetic adaptation of a much repeated cliché 'where there's a will, there's a way'. It is a monumental piece of art that can chill, thrill, excite and rejoice any type of audience. It renders a remarkable story of hope, trust, courage, determination and friendship while at the same time exploring the not-so-pleasant themes of corruption and police brutality."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	This movie the most one of the most greatest movies of all time in my opinion. It features great story, great characters as well as a amusing and sad plot. There are some sad moments in the movie like when the old librarian hung himself because he couldn't live outside of the big house and so on. And there is some feel good moments like when Red got released and when Andy escaped from the prison after twenty years. And it was very frustrating when the student Andy was teaching got shoot because it would prove Andy innocent and for him to be set free. Andy tries his best to fit into Shawshank prison by making little stone statues and a chess set. Where does he get the stone you ask? Well you have to watch it and find out because it is the most genius plan that any prisoner has come up with to escape Shawshank. In conclusion I would absolutely recommend this to any fan of cinema, Steven King, drama, comedy or tragedy then this film is the best for you.	10
 Cool movie, man!		9
 The Best Film Ever Made		10
 Superb Film.	Over all excellent movie, Truly keeps you captivated throughout the whole film and you become invested in the characters. The characters have so much charisma, the impact they have on each other through out is amazing to see. There is a greater meaning behind the actions and ending which gets engraved into your thoughts, even after finishing the film one can only walk themselves through the film in memory and try to make sense of it but in reality you'd have to watch the film twice just to notice how much more brilliant it really is than you actually thought! The actors were no doubt a great pick, the role really toned in on each actor's strengths and magnified it so the character was more visible than the mask. The story, with no doubt, plays out very smoothly and the consistent flow it has simply allows you to watch it without getting bored or impatient even once.	10
 Hallmark of storytelling.		10
 this is the most perfect movie i have ever c in ma Life.	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont. starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne. a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.The majority of the score consists of dark piano music, which plays along the main character's role at Shawshank."	10
 One of the best movies of all time	One of the best movies ever made. I have watched quite a lot of prison movies but this one takes the prize. I have watched this movie over 4 times the past year and every time the sheer dramatic impact of this movie gets me, regardless that i have watched it so many times. I'm not an expert on films i just enjoy watching them, and in my opinion this is the best movie i have ever watched in my life. Andy Dufrense's struggle as innocent man being imprisoned for 19 years before escaping from Shawshank and finnally claiming his well deserved redemption over all those hard years, some of them including pain emotional and physical but also one of the greatest virtues in humanity, Friendship.	10
 A story of way out from the worst hopeless situation using one's talent and patience.	This film certainly tells about how one's talent can be his tool to survive even in worst situation and if you use your talent, you may end up well.This is why liked this one.The movie is very well written and maintains the mystery and curiosity till the end.The title justifies the story and a kind of reveal message about the plot of the film. The film lacks a strong female character which would have spiced up things more. The film have some comic timings, limited only to few scenes.The portraying of the characters has been well lived in the story and thus make it a must watch movie of all the time.No doubt it is going to be in number one for a long time.	9
 Excellent	Honestly one of the greatest movies i have ever seen. I really would declare that this movie is one of the greatest ever made. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and when you ad Tim Robbins into the mix, how you go wrong right? Loved the chemistry between them and the surprise twist at the end is just great. I first saw this movie in my Freshman year of high school in my pop culture class and I should have hit myself for not seeing it sooner. This movie really makes me want to pursue a career in film. Its well Directed, the script is great, and the actors played the characters perfectly. I can honestly say that i have not seen a better movie.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever seen	"(This comment contains a little summary of the film, I didn't mean to spoil the movie for you, but when you are afraid of me spoiling the movie don't read the review.)The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. I've seen many films and this one really comes out. I think this movie is 'timeless'. It's an old movie, made in 1994 (I wasn't even born) but it doesn't feel like that when you are watching it. Alright I have to admit that you can see it on the quality of the film and on other things too. It isn't HD or something like that but it gives the film a special character that it needs to be so good. It also doesn't have all those special effects like in Life of Pi, with the tiger Richard Parker who is fully made with the computer, or in the Avengers. So it isn't spectacular in that way. I think the movie is spectacular in the way it's built up and in its plot line.Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is locked up in the Shawshank State Penitentiary because he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover. In prison he gets to know smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and soon they become friends. Red smuggles a rock hammer in prison for Andy to make 'chess pieces'. He also gets several posters and other stuff. He makes his chess pieces, but that's not the only reason for buying his hammer. He also has some other plans. First Andy works in the washing room and sometimes he gets raped by Bogs. One day the prison needs some men to work on the roof and with a little skill Andy can arrange some beers for his fellows. They start to like him and they accept him as a friend. Slightly Andy works himself up so he can do the accountancy of the director of the prison. He decides to swindle the director and he makes up an whole new person with every legit paper a human needs. After the release of Brooks Andy takes over the library and he gives it a new boost. He receives new money for books and he can expand it. His life in prison goes well but he doesn't lose his hope and faith in a better future even though Red has warned him that hope is a dangerous thing. When you want to know the end and the rest of the film you really need to buy and watch it because after the first time there is a big chance that you will love the film and that you are going to watch it more than once. I think that every single bit of the film perfectly fits. The music, the photography, the story There is a reason why this film is standing on number 1 in the IMDb top 250 and why it has 7 Oscar nominations."	9
 Well made but shallow	I will get straight to the point. This movie was made with very careful attention to detail. According to the Formula of life (Time + Effort = Value) It fits perfectly. Unfortunately the fault I found with this movie was in the thought process behind the acting. I was never sure of where any of the actors stood with themselves or each other meaning the movie's great twist at the end had no meaning. Acting only ever needs to be amazing but the story needs to be exceptional because in real life people don't act extraordinarily its the story of peoples lives which touches us the most because everyone can relate or compare their story the acting is just according to the actor. But other then that it was interesting to watch not so much enjoyable which is always sad.	8
 best movie i ever watched prison escapes	its different form other movie.... also have a unique story,....my favorite actors are Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.......so them take this story to a successful movie in the plant and make this movie to world best movie of all kind.....also commencement is bit boring ...... he was a good man however he had a mistake to her wife.....he attempt to murder his wife for bad behavior ....then he failed to prove it is a mistake of angry at the courthouse......unfortunately he went to prison for until death.... finally he figure out to escape from the prison ..... he got a mastermind plan to escape form the prison...he work hard to success this plan..... this is the Summary of this story .....i recommended all one to watch this movie .....every one must watch the whole story it is a marvelous story.....best movie ever watched..thanks!!!!	10
 Extremely over-rated but great movie!!	So for a great movie i provide you with a simple and short review. This is a film worth a watch with amazing story-line, drama and performance. Morgan Freeman made it up as a cast.But i can not say that this is a best or even a better movie at all. It is a usually movie with a catchy, just and simple plot. This film is equipped with nice and beautiful plus emotional and interesting plot with amazing direction. So this is a movie that appeals nearly everyone, and that is why it is so over-rated but that should not mean it is a all time best movie. It is a simple and honest movie which is great but yes over-rated.	7
 So unexpected	"I'm not one to judge a book by it's cover, or in this case a film, but I had no interest in watching this film. This was mainly due to the fact that my boyfriend loves it and we are usually on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to choosing films. But this is the one film that we can agree on. It has everything that he likes, (crime, violence and rebellion) whilst also having everything that I love in a film (a well thought out story, unexpected turns of events, great actors). Films are like a passion to me, and The Shawshank Redemption is in a league all of it's own. Tim Robbins created such a character that we all think we know but his deception and rebellion towards the end of the film intrigues me and makes me respect Andy so much more. ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"", the tag-line of the film holds a deep significance as nobody suspected a thing from Andy whilst the years passed by in prison, yet his ulterior motives fuelled by hope helped him in his quests!"	9
 Perfection	How do you define perfection in a movie? For me it's a combination of direction, script, performances and all the technical aspects of making a film, so that the viewer can be transported elsewhere. This is how I define the Shawshank Redemption. If you haven't seen it, you can be surprised by the end. But even when you see it again and again, it doesn't matter if you already know the end, because the journey is as much (if not more) enjoyable. It's an amazing movie, with great performances from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and all supporting cast. They make you feel happy, and sad, and laugh, and cry. Movies like this don't come very often, and should be enjoyed by all. Very highly recommended!	10
 Warning may contain spoilers	This film is truly a work of art a master piece one of the greats. This film is not just so amazing because of the amazing story (based of the Stephen king book) but also because of the amazing acting and directing. It's about Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is a banker that gets convicted of double murder and is sentenced to life term at shaw-shank were he meats Ellis read redding ( Morgan freeman ) who picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure manly to the fact that they have a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favour with the wardens and guards.	9
 Never loose the hope	"For the first time watchers the story starts with a lame and feels like boring. But it gradually picks up the pace after 15-20 Min's and every moment will be best. Tim Robbins acting is the best. The moral of this movie is always ""Hope for the Best"" Best will always come. You need to be a patience for it.If you watch the movie carefully there is a very good twist at the end which is not expected at all. Some of the famous TV series like prison break are based on this movie itself.Direction by Frank Darabont was simply superb. I can say that morgan freeman has given his career best performance in this movie.I would rate this 10 out of 10. Fantastic and all time top 1 movie."	10
 Best movie ever		10
 masterfully made, timeless, a classic	this is a must see in my opinion, a truly timeless film. One of my favorites of all time. This film is what started my deep respect for Morgan Freeman as not only an actor but a narrator. You are doing yourself a serious disservice by not seeing the Shawshank Redemption. trust me, watch it all the way through, right now, I've never heard anyone say they didn't like this film.I don't want to say anything about it because i don't want to ruin it, see it for your self.now.right now.	10
 Excellent Movie!		10
 Awesome Movie	Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. This was demonstrated later on with Darabont once again redefining the prison picture in The Green Mile - a classic in its own right. So why is Shawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure out. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for Andy and Red. A lot of deserved attention over the years has gone to Freeman, but Robbins carries his part just as well. We have to remember the Andy character is somewhat that of a semi-tough geek, which is a tough balancing act to portray - unless part of your own personality is much like that. Robbins impresses me for this and meets the expectation. But I think Freeman's character allows more scope for exceeding an expectation which is probably why Freeman is lauded a bit more. So Shawshank, after all these years, still awaits like a trap to ensnare new devotees. Another sign of its worthiness - it pulls you in quickly.	10
 Good		9
 One of the best	Few would say, a little slow in the starting, but have patience and you are here for a feast. The movie gets better every minute. The ending is terrific and I could not think of a better way to end the movie. Tim Robbins, man take a bow. !! _/\_ Morgan Freeman, always been good. I realized at the end that the movie didn't have a female role to spice it up. But you wouldn't feel the need for that. Also, the hot posters would do the job. I regret that I watched this movie 20 years after its release. This is truly an epic movie. Now, since the review needs to be of 10 lines minimum, I had to end it by praising the movie once again. Keep calm and do watch this.	8
 All time favorite!	This movie has all of the aspects you would expect of a great film. Based on Stephen King's short story, this tale of hope and loss, friendship and betrayal is nothing shy of magical. Your heart bleeds for Andy through his troubles with the sisters and then sings when he is finally free. You feel the hatred for the warden and the screws, while crying for the lost life of Brooks. I have seen so many different movies in my life and can honestly say, 100%, without a doubt that this beautifully crafted piece of art is hands down my all time favorite. I can watch Tim Robbins stroll through the yard and listen to Morgan Freeman narrate over and over. If you came to my house right new with a bag of popcorn and some wine with a copy of this in your hand, we would be besties for life.	10
 Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	
 Shawshanks Redemption - Once in a civilization	This movie is the Masterpiece and a benchmark in every aspect of film making. I feel that movie of this level is not possible to make in this civilization again. I postponed watching this movie for almost one year thinking it being a prison based movie, how WRONG i was cannot be explained in words. I actually saw this movie by pausing and listening again and again. Direction screenplay cinematography & acting all are molded, seems as if god himself gave a hand into it and result is THE BEST CREATION ever in film making. As movie finished for the first time i saw all cast and names of everyone who made this masterpiece. This movie is a must must watch if you are least lover of movies.	10
 Once in a Lifetime	"Watching this movie literally changed my life. I know you might thinking I'm one of those guys who don't have a life & spend (or may i say)waste valuable time watching movies. let's agree to disagree friends, OK I know there are some movies that after watching you asked yourself was it worth it? & there are some movies that awesome to watch, doesn't matter what genre it belongs. And then there is ""The Shawshank Redemption"". I recommend every person should watch this movie at least once in the lifetime to find the true beauty of life. To embrace life with every breath, to admire every moment passes over time that we too busy to enjoy. We often take our life as granted not knowing that the world may or may not be so beautiful without some key things. this movie can show you what yours."	10
 Best movie of all time	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 A great movie, maybe the best	When I'm talking to my friends about movies, we always talk about this one. Because everyone should have seen it. It is a must see movie and you won't be disappointed. The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies with a great story and acting work. I admire everyone that helped working on this movie because they did a really good job. I love everything about the movie, from the beginning till the end. This movie is a movie that reach you when watching it, it gives you special feelings about the story and makes you think about it. If you want to know the details and why I write this, just watch the movie. I can only say one thing to everyone who reads this, Watch the movie! And you will feel the same way about the movie as me.	9
 One of the best movie ever!!!!!!!!	I love this movie, a masterpiece, one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King book with me and has unexpected miracles. The actors are brilliant, I have not seen a movie of this quality makes. Morgan Freeman stars in one of his greatest roles, and Robbins, no doubt, done his best acting. Who has not seen this wasting time. Hopefully the studios and producers stop making movies just to raise money, and be dedicated to do this kind of movies that are in the story. No wonder this movie was the head of the ranking 250 of IMDb. Again, I recommend you see this movie, so no movies today.Thanks for this excellent IMDb page is very complete and is full of information, the application is also excellent for mobile phones.	10
 Best movie I've ever seen.		10
 Extraordinary!!	"Wow!!! Great plot. This movie won't get old for generations. It deserves No.1 every year... Lots of movies releasing all over the world based on prison break, but none of them can beat masterpieces like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Great Escape"". When ""Warden Norton""(Bob Gunton) tries to open Bible, Andy Dufresne handles the situation. This scene rolls again in all our mind, like mind blowing in the climax. Of course it's disappointing that other master-pieces like pulp_fiction and forest gump released in same year which made ""The Shawshank Redemption"" ended up with no Oscar's. What an extraordinary plot! This never gets old."	10
 The century's best!	The Shawshank Redemption in my opinion is the best movie out there. No other movie will show you such a thought provoking, well made, extraordinary acted, brilliant script than this film! A story of hope and redemption seems cliché and maybe even boring but this tale will never bore you. You'll fall in love with the characters. Morgan Freeman is again at his best, and Tim Robbins gives one of his best performances next to his in Mystic River. You can watch this movie over and over again and you'll still love it and it will feel like your first time seeing it. The movie is filled with passion that it will make you cry (coming from someone who never cries), it's soulful and emotional yet still gives you action. It's a rare gem that you'll fall in love with, I definitely did!	10
 Shawshank Redemption		9
 A dangerous journey with Hope...a mere classic :)	It is a movie that enthralls my mind and soul, as every time i thought about each & every moment of this wonderful movie. I say this movie is a journey, not because its a long movie, but it explains a definition of an act of HOPE. Yes, hope is the sweetest weapon of your arsenal that wins you unconquered battles of your life. Of course, it inspires you to danger the risks in achieving something, but yet you go for it.A fascinating story with an unbelievable & realistic twist that betters the moral & belief in yourself. Mind boggling performances from the actors and a remarkable direction that did 100% justice to story.A TRUE CLASSIC............	10
 Stay man ...		10
 The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.		10
 An Amazing Experience		10
 Very well made film		8
 good friends		10
 Corruption and Friendship	This is a amazing movie. It is one of my favorite movies. It depicts the story of Andy Dufresne, a famous banker who go to Shawshank for murder of his wife. This movie depicts friendship of two different persons having different views, how it grows. He was very intelligent man as he made his friendship with corrupted Warden of the Prison yet it was only one sided. In the end, when he escapes from the prison, he takes down the whole life of Warden and his colleagues. After few days, his friend Red also gets out of jail and travels to Texas and meet his friend Andy.As a whole this movie was good and even it is the best. It deserves to be number 1. I wonder how this movie not get Oscar for Best motion picture of the year 1994.	10
 One of the best movies - the unexpected happens all the time		10
 Shawnshank Redemption	This is my first time writing a review and I don't have a good grammar. I generally don't watch this type of movie. When I saw part of movie I decide to finish it. This movie was able to touch my heart. This movie doesn't have any special effect like most movie. This movie is really inspiring and is something everyone must see. I really like the story and the plot, everything fit well in the story and it really touching for anyone who see it.There are many thing I didn't expect to see like the warden being evil. In my opinion it seem that money is able anybody. Andy Dufresne is able to beat him and get free of his chain.This was my first movie that I really like and didn't contain special effect. It just a simple movie but a good story and with a message for everyone to know.	10
 The derfrence between Shawshank redemption and the others		10
 Classic	A must seen classic movie , which will make each and every viewer to HOPE for the best in their life. Each and every department of this movie has done a fantastic job. Unlike other movies , based on prison lives movie gives a new experience of hope and gives a positive energy. Movie's script has got all basic requirements of a movie such as suspense , wits, sex, gun shots and so on. Means every one will love this movie.All the actors had done a marvelous job. Screenplay doesn't lag anywhere and has a constant pace through out. I really Love this movie and the plot is perfect, means can be told to all generation even to the coming generation.	10
 Excellent Movie	I have never watched such a wonderful and nicely plotted movie. It (The Shawshank Redemption) shows the hope, the dreams of life, hardships you face in life. While watching, we always move with it with the hope for best, all the time. Although there is quite a difference between the characters and the viewers, but we never feel far away that what the character is doing and what is the feeling of the characters. We always flow with the waves.This is a simple yet having a deep message inside down the film. the director didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. This movies should have win all the Oscars awards, I really love this movie. I have watched a number of times.I think everyone should watch this movie and keep the rating up all the time, so that i can remain in top 250. Also please let your friends recommendation about the movie. This is my all time favorite movie.	10
 One Of The Best Of All Times		10
 Classic! Must Watch,	Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, where after watching are happy you invested your time in. The story line is simple, but the way it is made is terrific. You instantly root for Andy, the main character because he so likable. Upon watching this film there was so much hype around it, and I had to know why. Many famous scenes are recreated in other movies, and you will understand and respect the depth of it. Morgan Freeman gives a performance of a lifetime as per usual, and creates a wonderful film alongside Tim Robbins and other cast members. Frank Darabont clearly wanted to go out a create a masterpiece, and truly succeeded. There is no way this film can ever be forgotten, see for yourself.	9
 good story plot	"the movie was good but not as expected... movie was slow before halftime and also later after halftime. characters portrait was appreciable,life of jail shown was real and cruelty within jail too.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing. Morgan freeman's acting was good as usual.Tim Robbins performance was good. cinematography,direction everything was superb. every character shown in the movie was perfect. perfect timing of everything. hope to see such movie's in future...."	8
 The most effective prison movies in cinematic history	The Shawshank Redemption has certainly earned its reputation as one of the most effective prison movies in cinematic history - as the film, written and directed by Frank Darabont, contains virtually all of the tropes and devices that the genre has come to be associated with. The ensuing inclusion of such familiar elements as the Evil Warden and the Sadistic Guard are undeniably put to brilliant use by Darabont, with the end result a piece of work that - aside from a midsection that's almost egregiously episodic - manages to hold the viewer transfixed virtually from start to finish. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama,but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons.	9
 Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover.		10
 Best movie by all time	This movie will make you think about short life really are. Tim Robins who play a wrongly prisionized man which spend over 20 years of his life in prison for something that he did not do. He makes the most of the situation and even improves the living standard in Shawshank (the prison). You should also watch this brilliant movie to hear the best story teller in the world, Morgan Freeman. The way he speaks in a slow and convincing way, is perfect. It is also a must watch because you becomes very positive to life after watching it. Suddenly your own problems does not seem so big anymore. To summerize it, it is a great movie, with amazing actors performances and a brilliant manuscript and regi. Do watch it you will not regret it.	10
 About the movie	A friend of mine told me 2 years ago about this film, A said maybe it's boring but after I seen it I was speechlessThe greatest movie set in a prison I've ever seen! Its full of courage from Tim Robbins to survive prison and no matter what the differences between him and Morgan Freeman and all the other prisoners, no matter what violence comes up, no matter their crimes, no matter what crazy or illegal things they have to do to survive prison, no matter what the warden does to Tim Robbins, together prison is awesome and they can redeem themselves. Movies like this show what would happen if prisoners accept people's differences and redeem themselves from their crimes and that's good thing because people don't need to act like idiots in prison. Despite the graphic violence in this movie in the beginning, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman used friendship to forget prison and made each other good people and they were great people! Whoever does NOT like this movie is a bully and needs lighten up because this is a light-heart movie of teaching you the lessons of prison.	10
 An all time favorite	This is my number one favorite movie. I can watch this several times a year! Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship and how far those to things can get you. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again...	10
 Awesome		9
 Just a Beautiful Long Experience		10
 an awesome movie i have ever seen	an awesome movie i have ever seen... Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption is a novella by Stephen King, from his collection Different Seasons (1982), subtitled Hope Springs Eternal. It was adapted for the screen in 1994 as The Shawshank Redemption, which was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994, including Best Picture.[1] In 2009, it was adapted for the stage as the play The Shawshank Redemption.[2]The novella's plot line is heavily based on God Sees the Truth, But Waits by Leo Tolstoy. This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.	9
 Where do I start with this movie?!		10
 A great Movie	There is really not lots of movies that i can really be forgetful, i see lots of mistakes, and moral things of lots of great movies, because i -maybe i an bad- analyze everything that is happening around, is pretty hard, and very remarkable to a movie, to accomplish the sense of freedom -this has two meanings- that this movie could, i really could forget about insubstantial problems, at and after watching the movie, it gives great advice about moral interrogations, and life itself, a pretty neat movie, authentic, and not boring at all, i wonder how it have been, without the cultural references that i already knew about the film. If you have some spare time, what are you waiting for?	9
 One of the best movie ever. (sorry for English mistakes)	"I saw The Shawshank Redemption only a few weeks ago, while I knew it was number 1 on IMDb Top 250. Knowing the main idea of the movie, I couldn't imagine how this movie can be at the top. I watched it on TV and this was one of those rare films which excited me so much in front of my TV. I will not talk about the acting or the directing because so many reviewers did a better review about that before me but I will just add that what I find so unique to this movie is that he is RIGHT from the beginning to the end. You feel so moved all along the movie and when the movie is over I have this impression that it was a movie quiet ""simple"" shared with a feeling of having saw something that is a way higher others movies. And that is what make this movie extraordinary."	9
 Classic	One of the best movies ever. This one never gets old. Tim Robbins is my favorite actor and was before this movie. This movie is one of his best. His other classic favorite of mine is Jacobs Ladder. Love the development of the characters in the movie. Each one is his on and adds to the movie. Very good script, very original, clever. I wish he would have won the Oscar for this movie. I also wish Morgan Freeman would have won as well. Another point that was made in this movie that sticks, is how when you have done the same thing for so long, you don't know how to not do it. Point was made and shown several times by different actors. Love this quote: She was beautiful. God I loved her. I just didn't know how to show it.	10
 One of the best movies	This film is without a doubt a classic that will be watched until the end of time. A must see movie for anybody that wants to have their heart touched. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman together is a work of art, the chemistry that these two actors bring to the table is incredible. I had to write a paper about this film in English 101 class. After watching this film four times in one week I noticed certain themes in scenes that after the first time watching it I did not catch. Each scene has so much background that it fascinating to watch from beginning to end. We have to give credit to Stephen King, his short story is the main reason why this movie exist. Great movie enough said! Definitely a must watch. -Edd	10
 Brilliant!	The film is very gripping which holds you straight from the start. You never want it to end, however you cant help being amazed when it does. This is a film that needs to be watched by everyone and is truly one of the all time greats. The main character in this film really has you liking him from the very off, so all the way through the film your wanting them to get some luck or happiness and if he does it is shared with the watcher. Other characters in this film also display an awesome role within the film and making it such a success. This film was truly acted out to perfection and couldn't of been done better, however if your not a fan of long films then this one may irritate you a little, however I couldn't imagine people not liking this film.	9
 With a life different from anything in the outside world, the movie hooks you from its very first scene.		10
 A True Masterpiece	As i started watching this i was already convinced that i saw the best movie of 1994.And i don't even get why the director to this film Frank Darabont didn't even win or was nominated for the best director Oscar.This film also has 2 of the greatest performances throughout the whole movie which were the Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman performances.Also this movie deserves to be on the IMDb top 250 because this movie will keep you in your seat from start to finish,and those of you people out there who haven't seen this movie i recommend that you have to watch this movie, And has a great premise as well. The movie also has other great performances from James Whitmore,Bob Gunton,and Clancy Brown.	10
 Amazing	I have seen this movie only a few times. The first time I was really too young to appreciate it. When I watched it recently it reminded how good the movie actually was. I was too young to appreciate things in it then and now, it was such an eye opener. A must watch for people who haven't seen it. The story follows a man who is put in prison. There he finds many prison mates that become friends and value him as a person. The main character goes through many unfortunate events and trials but what eventually happens in the end is quite a good surprise. The cast did an amazing job and the movie is inspiring. I recommend people to watch this film.	10
 One of my favorite prison movies ever	I don't like prison movies that much but this was the best prison movie I have ever seen. I like ever thing about it. The acting was really good. ******spoiler alert ******* I liked it when Andy is escaping the prison . I like how he he made the whole on the wall to escape that was good I also like when the two friends are reunited at the end of the movie. This movie was really good.i don't like writing much but I will write the ten lines I need for this review cause this movie was really good. I don't agree with some these movies that are in the IMDb top 250 but with this I do. I don't know if it should be number 1 but it was really good. If you want to watch a good prison movie then watch this one cause this is the best prison movie I have ever seen. I recommend this movie to everybody to see it. So if you haven't seen this movie go and watch it you will probably like more or as much as i did. You have to see this movie at least once in your whole entire life time.	10
 Just an AWESOME movie.	It was a best movie I have ever seen. I enjoyed the movie very much & I was just speechless when I watched the movie first. It was create a amazing feelings inside my heart. After watching this movie I know about the depth of friendship. A good friend can make our life beautiful & it's proved in my life. Friendship is the best relation after FAMILY. And this movie realize me the truth. I love my friends & family to much. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actor of this movie. Without him the movie will incomplete. Hats off to the writer, director & actors. I personally appreciate them from the bottom of my heart for making this high quality movie.	10
 Awesome	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 It is a movie of prison life		10

" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story,"		9
 certainly one one the most touching films i've seen		10
 Brilliant movie that includes great acting	This is prolly one of the best movies i've ever seen in my whole life! The acting is so incredible and same goes with the plot. This movie gets 10/10 from me because the ending part when Morgan Freeman gets outta jail to and meets up with that other guy is just breath taking. Morgan Freeman does a really great job in this movie because he plays this guy that isn't a bad guy but a he still keeps his cool. Same goes with the main char that really tries to tell everyone that hes innocent. This is a movie that i think everyone should at least watch once in a lifetime. Yes some of you may think that I'm overdoing it, but i promise you this is a great bad ass movie!Review from - Labinot Sadrija	8
 Incredible	After years of being told to watch this film I finally did a few weeks ago and was not disappointed. Stunningly written and amazing performances, Morgan Freeman is especially brilliant, even more so than usual. The clever nature of the script coupled with the uplifting nature of the story make it comfortably the best film I have ever had the pleasure of watching. When in response to the question 'what is the greatest film of all time?' I answer 'The Shawshank Redemption,' my friends tend to groan. They say that as it is such a common answer to the question I am copping out, I say there is a reason it is such a common answer. Truly life affirming.	10
 The Best of the Best	The film kept me going throughout the whole movie! I couldn't believe how the production was able to pull such a great film off. I even talk to a few of my colleagues about this film and every single one gave nothing but the up most respect and feedback that this film should have been nominated more then the few awards it received. Morgan Freeman is one of the best actors and mentors of this age and time. I really look up to him for inspirational feedback and knowledge to help me as an young artist to better develop my craft and skills. I have grown to love this film over and over with time, this have became one of my favorite and best movie of all time. Morgan Freeman this is one of your best performance and I am truly happy to know that your work is still going.	10

 The best story ever told on film.		10
 Absolutely brilliant!	It's simply one of the best movies off all time. All is perfect: Screenplay, cinematography,acting,production...The performances are of the highest quality- every character is portrayed in such a way as to enhance the authenticity of the film and give it true life. The most complete movie that I've ever seen. I really recommend this movie to anyone. It tells use there exists brightness in the darkness and never gives up hope. Once again, in my opinion,this is simply the best movie ever made,with so many moments burned forever in my memory.... I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. An absolute masterpiece.	10
 Just amazing!	This movie was just amazing just so good i feel like everyone should watch it, i felt hooked on all aspects of this film, i felt that each and every scene was captivating from the music to the acting to the atmosphere and dialogue it was that good! The atmosphere in the scene is just impeccable, and it shows a great narrative with all the quirks and features we want to see and not something that is just made for the fun of it for cash, this movie is truly captivating, i feel so connected to the character more that anything. I watched this film so many times and it still steals me away with the amazing acting from the best. The atmosphere makes the film even more amazing, i just wish that there was much more so that i could keep watching and never stop because that is the effect Shawshank Redemption has left on me and i can talk forever but i think that just watching the movie is better, there are many ways you still can watch this on a lot of things, and i know it is still on NETFLIX it is a great watch 10/10 please go see it now i highly recommend it.	10
 Just the perfect movie	Absolutely the perfect movie, taking you through all your emotions, insisting on making you feel your hope, anger, disgust, compassion, love, hate and pride. Genuinely moving with a voice-over to die for. The narration takes you on a journey of epic storytelling, whilst still moving you to tears. Morgan Freeman delivers the most powerful performance, I think, of his career as the very likable Red, while the then unknown to me, Tim Robbins delivers a poignant performance of an ill justified innocent who gets caught up in a web of in-prison politics and corruption. The schemes of Tim's character, Andy Dufresne with his wizardry with the abacus and knowledge of the tax system befriends the prisoners and the officers and the smug look on his face is to die for when he get his inmates a bottle of beer each to drink in the sunshine. How this didn't win an Oscar, I do not understand.	10
 One of the best movies I've ever watched.		10
 Great Story	This is a timeless film that has many great life lessons. Every time I see this movie, it is just as enjoyable as the previous time watching. It's a heartwarming story about a man who is put into a tough situation and learns to overcome adversity as well as make a few friends in one of the harshest environments in society. I notice similarities between this movie and the television show Prison Break. I believe the writers for prison break used this movie as an inspiration for the show which is great because I love both projects. I enjoy movies of this genre and I strongly recommend it for family movie night or anyone of any age. It is a must see.	10
 A must see film	Is film is a timeless classic, there are no two ways of saying it. It doesn't have explosions, mass deaths or laugh out loud comedy. Yet it still appeals to everyone. It has a simple and well thought out story line with a very simplistic narrative voice over, but with it being so simple - it makes it so brilliant. This film is the best example to everyone, that you don't need explosions to create a masterpiece. Just Morgan Freeman and some casual swearing.Many would say that because it isn't exiting all the time it isn't a good film. But 'The Shawshank Redemption' creates it's own category, were you will never be able to compare it to another films.	10
 All is not lost if u give your hope some time	A must watch this movie is with the movie nicely setup by its front line cast thus compelling with the excellent script of the movie. Loses a bit of essence in the middle but still keep u in grasp with the hope of the felony.This movie has all factors that a movie can have apart from romance only and thus add versatility to this movie.Morgan Freeman has done a excellent job in the complimenting the rhythm set up by Tim Robbins. It also gives us an idea that corruption is everywhere even in closed bars of a jail it is practiced rather casually. And how many flaws are there in our decision making bodies. But in the end the hope of one man stand above all this things and inspire others in the same environment thus showing one of the brightest qualities of a human that is belief and inspiration. That's all I can say about this movie. Thank you	9
 A Solid And Well-Done Film, Not A Masterpiece		6
 A man's to desire to freedom	Can never imagine Shawshank could keep this secret for such a long time. When his friend subsided when leaving the poison, he never quit his dream. When the poison leader forced him to do illegal things, he compromised to survive, because there is a dream deeply rooted in his mind. A man is never broken down if only his mind is strong. Sometimes we consider desire as a kind of forbidden thing where wicked things happened, however in other point, desire is a kind of driving force. I think the director is trying to convey to the audience that there is a kind of force that can drive people to success. We should use this force to help us.	9
 Message of Hope is undeniably one of the best ever captured on film	Shawshank was one of the best movie I've ever watched. The message of hope is undeniably one of the best themes and the director does a masterful job at delivering it so patiently and yet with precision and passion and in one of the most inspiring ways a movie can.Andy and red are skillfully acted and the narration by Morgan Freeman is intensely touching. Its a shame they did not get recognized by the academy, but they should by now realize they were part of a masterpiece. most movies fade in interest when one watches them more than once, not Shawshank. The story stays strong, the message ever more alive and fresh, and the acting truly is one of the best.Thank you Frank for making this movie.	10
 Couregeous, and Smart with abundant supply of Hope		10
 Excellence	A story of brotherhood, revenge, trials and tribulation. A man is imprisoned and the story goes along with the decades he spends behind the bars of an old and corrupt prison with some of the best characters written and some of the best actors portraying those characters. This movie was just put together right. There is no doubt you will love this film and love the characters. I rated this title a 10 and barely anything else rates this with me. The Green Mile would be another that was put together in such a way there is no way to NOT love it! One of the very best movies made from the stories of Stephen King. Without a doubt one of the movies I'd want with me while stranded on a deserted island. You will love this movie unless you are dead.	10
 Great Movie	"I just saw the movie it was great, the symbolism, the actors everything and everyone in that movie were brilliant. It maybe an ""old"" movie, doesn't have special effects and stuff but i enjoyed every second of that movie. In two words brilliant and magnificent (I cant describe it in one word).It is about a man who never give up in what life throws at him, but this is a little bit common. So what is that keeps ""awake"" on an almost 3 hour movie? Is the way that the movie flows, the dialogs, humor and the mystery that keeps you ""awake"". In conclusion, i believe that it's a movie worth seeing no matter what. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great couple and remember that it's all about freedom."	10
 Such a Great Film	What can I say that hasn't been said yet? This film is amazing and one of the best ever made with fantastic performances. Forget about my review and any other. Go and watch this film right now. Seriously, just go do it. No amount of words can describe this films greatness. One of the best things about this film, besides the acting, is the music by Thomas Newman. It certainly deserves all the awards it got and more. The direction is superb, emotion is real, and the overall story is brilliant. Out of ten stars, this is definitely 9 but out of by usual 5 rating it is certainly a 4.5. I have watched this numerous times since my first viewing and it only gets better and better. Again, if you have not seen this film yet, please do yourself a favor and go watch it. You will not regret it.	9
 Best movie ever!	One of the best movies ever came out in the last 30 years . The film expresses a lot of depth and gives a feeling of connection to the players. I think the director did an amazing job and gave a spectacular display film which gives the viewer the ability to judge and connect simulate not see any film today. The film itself is built well and gives a feeling of wanting to be there. There is no possibility to know what will be the end and anyone who watched expect a good show quality that will give the viewer the experience of movies which had expected . Of course there is the little things that cause to panic and a desire to stop watching due to the unpleasant feelings that pass on the viewer but it only intensifies the experience within the film. Satisfied, fascinated , amazing, fantastic , spotless , movie end of the road .	10
 Incredible Film - You Need to See It		10
 AMAGES YOU Every time	"Shawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can conj our. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence, humor, an extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central performances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told that makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have theorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of Jesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a lecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who we think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major 'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether ""It's time to get busy dying, or get busy living"". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM."	10
 The shawshank redemption through the eyes of a teen	Yes I'm 15 years old I've seen this movie once and that was almost a year ago. After seeing this movie for the first time in my life I felt like a changed person. Yes everyone has hard times but this movie showed me not only the power of hope but the power of friendship. It's funny my name is Andy my dad names me this because of the shawshank redemption and now I feel blessed to have that name. When Andy is brought to prison my first thought was he was a bad or even evil person. Over time that calmly slips away. I think what makes this the #1 movie of all time is the redemption part. Yes there are plenty of good movies about hope and change, but the great films such as shawshank convince you there will be a bad or sad ending and it doesn't happen. I will show this to my kids whenever that happens I will wage tell there my age though not because of the violence or the rape or language but because when they see this I want them to understand it and love it and hopefully change them.	10
 Masterful film making	You don't get emotive, engaging story telling like this any more. Every aspect of the film, from the cinematography to the performances are top notch. The beauty of the film is that even the smaller characters have a story to tell, a journey to take you on, which seems to be completely missing in films now a days. Though Stephen King is normally associated with horror, this story is very human and touching, to the point where it becomes inspirational. In fact it has been King's non horror stories that seemed to have been most successful at being adapted into movies. This movie along with Stand by Me, though I'm sure many will disagree with me on that point. Well worth a watch when you're having a quiet night in.	9
 The best movie for those who lost HOPE		10
 Favorite	This movie is one of my all time favorites. I can quote this movie pretty much through the whole movie. It is a riveting film, and it never bores you. It makes you feel every emotion. It makes you laugh, cry, cheer, and empathize over the course of the movie. I've seen very few movies that almost every type of person enjoys. I seriously question people's tastes if they don't at least acknowledge the fact this was a brilliant movie. They don't have to like it ( which I find out pretty rare ) but they have to admit, they acting was great. Writing this review makes me want to watch it again. The ending always makes me smile.	10
 This is my review of the film: The Shawshank Redemption	"The Shawshank Redemption has always been one of my favorite films to watch. I was introduced to this movie by my dad, who has always been a huge fan of the film. I didn't think at first I would have liked the movie, but I was wrong. Tim Robbins plays a character called Andy; who was sentenced to prison for committing a crime he never committed. Tim Robbins did a remarkable job of playing Andy. Andy had this attitude about him that captured the audience in a special way. He was always so calm, and although he had been put in prison for something he didn't do and, was treated horribly by some of his fellow inmates; he still remained a humble individual. He didn't let these actions of others affect his life. He knew he didn't do anything wrong. He knew what kind of a man he was, and he wanted out of prison. Morgan Freeman played ""Red"" a character whom Andy befriended in prison. Just like the audience watching the film, Red was always drawn to Andy. Andy always kept Red guessing of what was to come. I always enjoyed the relationship shared between Andy and Red. It's the kind of friendship you'd want with someone-even given the circumstances in which they were living. Eventually, Andy devised a plan and escaped Shawshank. Red eventually was let out of prison and went on to find Andy. This was another one of my favorite parts of the movie; not only the fact that Andy escaped from the prison in which he didn't belong but Red and him were reunited. I think in the end despite the fact that Red and Andy were prison inmates; everyone was on their side. They had never really seemed like they belonged in prison. They seemed like they were good people. Above all I believed after so long some people just learn their lesson and deserve to be sent home. This film is truly amazing and never gets old for me. There will never be another one quite like it."	8
 Just a Beautiful movie		9
 Good Movie!!	Andy Dufresne, a successful banker is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover. At first, it is hard for him to get used to it on the inside, but when he meets Red, the guy who can get it for you, they become friends and they work their problems out together. The guards seem to like Andy after he helped Captain Hadley with his tax issues. They give Andy more privileges. They let him write letters, help the guards during Tax Season, build the Shawshank Prison Library, and teach other prisoners education. But when the new inmate Tommy, who was one of Andy's classmates for reading, is shot by Captain Hadley, Andy feels it's time for him to escape with the help of his friend Red. He tells Red that when he escapes, he plans to move down to Zihuatanejo. He tells Red that when he finally is released from the prison, he wants him to move with him. Red agrees. So then on a stormy night, Andy used a rock hammer to tunnel through the cement wall. Then he crawls through a sewer tunnel 500 yards long out to a creek. Then shortly afterwards, Captain Hadley is taken to prison after shooting the inmate Tommy, and Norton the Warden shoots himself after he sees Captain Hadley being taken away. Then the day comes, when they release Red from the prison, and like he promised Andy, he got a ticket to ride a bus down to Zihuatanejo, where he finally gets to meet his friend Andy again.	10
 Amazing film experience!	This movie should be added as a syllabus for students of film.Everything is great, the direction, acting, the works! A brutally honest look at hope, which is just inside the realm of possibility.This makes you want to take life in a better spirit than you already do. Should be shown to young adults to teach them the value of patience, which is something that's going out of fashion in this era of 'everything online'.There's something to be said about Stephen King. . . he may not be the best writer, but he is definitely the best storyteller.	9
 moving	One of the best movies I have ever seen. Tim, was amazing and moving. Morgan, was spectacular....not surprising at all. This movie will make you feel for each character. you will happy and sad all at the same time. If you have not seen this movie yet, you must. It is my #1 movie. I can't say it is best for kids, due to some scenes. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 What a master piece!	"This was one of the most excellent movie I have ever seen. Such great acting and characters this movie turns out to be more than your expectations. You might see many jail movies but nothing is even near to this movie. The best line is ""Andy Dufresne was my friend."" The way Morgan freeman says it, it's wonderful. Acting of Tim Robbins is remarkable. I really wonder why this movie could not win Oscars. Having Morgan Freeman in film itself is a tag of excellent script. Besides that direction is also very well done. You will not have seen such planned and brilliant movie till now Do watch it. This movie deserves to be on top."	10
 :)	"There are standard ways to stage a prison film and standard ways to tell a story by Stephen King. But ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" based on a King novella and set in the correctional institution of the title, succeeds in avoiding the familiar.Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before. The writer and director, Frank Darabont, tells this tale with a surprising degree of loving care.There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock. The film spans nearly 20 years of friendship between these two.When Andy is convicted of his wife's murder, the judge pronounces him ""a particularly remorseless and icy man."" He sustains that chill when he first arrives at Shawshank, remaining aloof from other inmates even when those inmates threaten him with physical harm. ""I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight,"" says Red, who knows Andy has been gang-raped by fellow prisoners, in one of the film's only halfway-brutal episodes. ""I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world.""Needless to say, the heroes of such stories usually do succeed in defending themselves, at least when Hollywood is telling the fairy tale. But ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has its own brand of iconoclasm, with Mr. Darabont's direction as quiet, purposeful and secretive as Andy is himself.Eventually Andy begins to fit in, especially after he wows the guards with skills left over from his pre-prison banking career. From the first time he advises one guard to make a one-time-only tax-free gift to his wife, Andy gets a new lease on life as ""a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.""Andy does special fiscal favors for the warden. (""You know, the funny thing is, on the outside I was an honest man, straight as an arrow,"" he says about this. ""I had to come to prison to be a crook."") He also makes the occasional dramatic gesture, like commandeering the prison's loudspeaker and playing a Mozart aria for all his fellow inmates. The film has a tendency to wax romantic at such moments, but more often it sustains an intelligent reserve.Mr. Freeman is so quietly impressive here that there's reason to wish Red's role had more range. As written, he spends his time observing Andy fondly and describing prison life. But Mr. Freeman's commanding presence makes him a much stronger figure than that. Mr. Freeman is especially moving when he suggests how dependent Red has become on the prison walls that give shape to his life. Even so, Red has kept his ruefulness. ""Only guilty man in Shawshank,"" he jokes about himself.Mr. Robbins has the trickier role of someone whose still waters run deep, but whose experience doesn't add up until an exposition-packed denouement. (The film's swift, enjoyably far-fetched closing scenes are a sharp reminder of who is the author of this story, after all.) Andy's is the more subdued role, but Mr. Robbins plays it intensely, and he ages effectively from newcomer to father figure during the story. One of Andy's projects is improving the prison library, which once contained nothing but the equivalent of books by Stephen King.To raise funds for this undertaking, Andy is steady and patient, writing weekly letters to state officials until he gets what he wants. Mr. Darabont, a screenwriter making an impressive directorial debut, works in much the same quietly persistent way. ""The Shawshank Conspiracy"" takes shape slowly and carefully, displaying an overall subtlety that's surprising in a movie of this genre. In the end, like Andy and Red, it gets to where it wanted to go.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and occasional violence, including a scene that discreetly suggests homosexual rape.THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Written and directed by Frank Darabont, based on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" by Stephen King; director of photography, Roger Deakins; edited by Richard Francis- Bruce; music by Tom Newman; production designer, Terence Marsh; produced by Niki Marvin; released by Columbia Pictures. Running time: 142 minutes. This film is rated R. WITH: Morgan Freeman (Red), Tim Robbins (Andy), Gil Bellows (Tommy), Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), Mark Rolston (Bogs Diamond), William Sadler (Heywood) and James Whitmore (Brooks Hatlen)."	10
 Good But Not The Best	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is very entertaining, and quite possibly the greatest prison film of all-time.Based on the Stephen King's novel of the same name, the film shows what happens to Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) after he is ordered to prison for a double murder that he did not commit. Much of the film story revolves around Andy and the friendships he makes in the barbarous environment that is a prison.It the best films from the 90s but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" for me trails ""The Lion King"",""Forest Gump"", ""Pulp Fiction"" & possibly even ""Leon: The Professional"" for best films of 1994. As well as this the film, can be in some parts slow and be a bit boring.Despite this, the film is enjoyable and has some scenes that truly hit you hard (Brooks' release). It is good but overrated"	8
 Perfect	Movies can not be predicted from the beginning that will never end.the characters are very original.and very well finished.people are getting into the prison environment.A movie that appeals to everyone.A lot can be said about.deserves all the praise.feeling very well have been transferred.One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance.As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once.	9
 Summary	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience.""The Shawshank Redemption"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture)."	9
 Great Work, Beautiful Story	The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that mark a trip to the movies Forever is one of those movies that we see once every 10 years, created world, the plot, everything in this film is spectacular, one 10/10 Fully deserved, too many movies deserve this, but none deserves as much as The Shawshank Redemption. Splendid work of Frank Darabont and another magnificent - but more than normal - work great actor Morgan Freeman. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films we will pass to our children, is more one of those that we will remember forever, everything in this film is perfect, nothing bad, all good, I LOVE THIS MOVIE	10
" ""Hope - the best of things. Hope never dies! """		10
 Best movie I've seen		10
 A great Movie from a Great short story	I have to say: Yes, it is a great movie, but it came directly from a short story wrote by Stephen King, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption...so if you read the story after the movie you'll find that basically they use it as a script because there is not modification at all. So the movie was good but did not received any big price due to in this year it was in the same Oscar with Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. The story is very dramatic and started when a very smart bank vice president is sent to prison because was found guilty in court to kill his wife and her lover. In prison he would be facing very strong situations as a smart accountant he is bringing a new face to the prison and to his life.The director Frank Darabont also was in charge of the Script.	8
 This is a Movie - Hope this word makes us all to understand that its perfect!!!		10
 A movie worth watching	Looking back at old classics , I remembered that I forgot to watch this awesome movie.When I watched it , my heart stopped a bit making me feel like that how I missed such a movie.First of all , the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins was above extraordinary.How Tim finds a new life to get out when the world seems dark is a masterpiece concept including his dialogue delivering at instances when depressing actions occur from him.So, guys just watch it.Morgan Freeman is known for his acting in movies like Wanted.He also played an important part in this movie.He played the role of a friend to Tim Robbins.together how they work with each other is a thing that is to be watched.bond knows no boundaries.I will not go about the plot.But a deep level realizing the characters has to be there	9

 One Of the Best Film Ever Made		10
 Just short of perfection	"The movie just captivates the viewer from start to finish. Morgan Freeman as ""Red"" is just perfect and gets the viewers attention from the start. Just a great story, told in a smooth line and stays interesting. Plot twists, double crossings, pin-up posters are all there. The book written by Stephen King adapts well to the screen and it deserves all the credit that is due. Its a long movie, which never gets old and never gets boring. Some well known actors are included, familiar faces and new faces. This movie has it all. In abundance. There is a reason I am a huge fan of Morgan Freeman and this movie was pretty much the start of it all. A brilliant actor, a compelling story, what more can you ask for in a movie that is set in a prison. Shear brilliance."	10
 Fantastic	A saw this movie, and it was truly amazing. This movie has all what a movie needs. I love it. The movie is about a man who gets unfair put in jail. Here he meets a man whom he befriends. After many years he turns gradually to life in prison. But that does not prevent him for his plan to escape. He makes accounting for the prison director as he once was a banker. Warden becomes dependent on him, and doing all that he never gets out of prison. But he is a very smart man and he thinks about everything.Morgan Freeman is the companion he meets in prison, tells the story. And with his deep credible voice, you assume right into the story. The whole movie is just amazing. And it is well thought out down to the smallest detail.	10
 a magic film: the Shawnshank Redemption	What can I add to this film? So much people have already told all the things about it. Neverless, if I can add my opinion, it could be that for me, the Shawnshank Redemption, is among the top ten best films ever. This movie deals with the conditions in the different jails around the world through the story of an incredible character plaid by Tim Robbins at the top of his art.If I can give you an advice it could be to look this film as soon as possible. You will become better!I hope that after my review you will crave to look one of the best film ever.	9
 Best of the best.	First of all i want to start by saying that i am not the guy who would sit on his computer and write a review about anything. However i felt that ''The Shawshank Redemption'' was a movie that would leave,everyone,and i mean EVERYONE stunned.Amazing acting,deep drama,an excellent story and the feeling of that special something you cant forget sum it all up for this masterpiece.I highly recommend you see this movie which will leave a stigma in your mind.Mr. Morgan deserved the Oscar for this one but unfortunately it went to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump.Don't get me wrong,both movies were excellent but i think Shawshank is better overall.Undoublty my all time favourite movie,regardless of genre!	10
 Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies.	"Shawshank is unique in the genre and unlocked a new potential for movie makers to break the inherent confines of a prison picture. So why is Shawshank so popular and tops many best movie lists? Not hard to figure out. The entertainment value is high and our empathy is heightened for Andy and Red. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope. Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. We move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."""	10
" One of the most exciting films ever made ""Shawshank Redemption"""	"Shawshank Redemption is a very real film, beginning to tell a story of an "" innocent "" person but make us think that he committed the crime since the beginning . The main actor was convicted for a crime he did not but that from the beginning he was planning his escape from prison , trying to get in trust with the chief of the prison and the guards also well felicitated the realization of his plan . In addition to planning his escape he helped a lot in prison who was convicted, to people that it was with him, and also built a library. Spent many years working to excavate the tunnel to escape , managed to free himself from that place leaving evidence that the head of the prison was a criminal who was arrested by the police . Before his escape , he left some clues for "" best friend "" with which he was sentenced for them to meet when the second out of prison . This story is very exciting and for those who did not see this movie should do it because it makes us think about our life and we have to cherish every moment ."	10
 One of the best movies i saw for years.	Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie done right. With both the story and technical aspects of the film at the highest caliber, it delivers a powerful tale that is timeless. Star Morgan Freeman gives a great performance, but Tim Robbins undeniably delivers. From the lighting to score, one cannot help but appreciate this fine example of a powerful adaptation at its finest. It is a beautiful piece of history and takes its place among the best. Even the pacing of the story is well placed to give a sense of hopelessness within the prison, but not dragging on and prolonging confinement. The creativity and originality behind this leaves viewers in awe of a great film.	10
 Amazing film		10
 Nothing to say......		10
 One of The Greatest Films Ever Made	This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.	9
 One of the best movies ever made.	The first time that I saw this movie was in my film class last semester in college. The teacher was supposed to play Pulp Fiction and changed his mind at the last minute. Most of us we're not very happy and didn't want to see a 2+ hour film about a guy in prison. When the movie let out everybody literally cheered. Shawshank has the amazing ability that most films lack to grab our attentions and keep it for such a long length of time. It also has the ability to make out spirits soar unlike any other film. No matter how low you are, when you are done watching Shawshank you are ready to fly. Amazing acting, flawless directing and a perfect story make this film a must see for anybody who enjoys movies. A perfect 10!	10
 Never Fails to Impress Me	This movie has got to be one of my all time favorites. At one point i had a broken DVD player and this DVD was stuck in the machine for almost a whole summer. Didn't even matter to me because it just gave me a great excuse to watch this wonderful movie over and over again. I will never not love this movie. Morgan Freeman's voice and character alone never failed to warm my bones. Shawshank is overall a classic that will be around for years to come. It encompasses many moral values that most people don't think twice about. It's got crazy and heart sulking relationships, and you will have no other choice but to empathize with the main character. If you haven't seen this glorious film yet you must lock yourself in a room somewhere until you witness this amazing classic.	10
 My favorite movie ever!	The best film I have ever seen. Period. No other film in history has come closer to perfection. In terms of the acting, the screen-writing, the directing, the music, the plot and its various sub-plots... The story in general is heart-warming and inspiring, portraying both the best and the worst of mankind. There are few films that I can watch over and over again without getting bored, but Shawshank Redemption more than any other movie does that for me. Even when I watch it for the umpteenth time at some point in 2014, I can guarantee that I will still feel the same goosebumps when Andy memorably advises Red to 'get busy living' or get busy dying', and the same upsurge of warmth, emotion, happiness and relief when Red is finally granted parole and he re-unites with Andy in the final scene. Perfection, perfection, perfection. 10/10	10
 I was hesitant about watching this movie, but I'm glad I did.	So in the beginning I wasn't anticipated to watch this movie. I judged it would be slow, uninteresting, and overrated with people jumping the bandwagon of how good it was. But as I was seeing how the movie was unfolding, I was surprised to see how interesting it really was. There wasn't a dull moment of it. I was pleased with how the ending made me feel. I think the big thing about this movie is how it captures your emotions. The actors were great, and the story was great too. Overall I give it a 9.5. But I do think this is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It is definitely in my top three. Don't let the title stop you from watching it if it sounds boring to you. This is a movie I would watch over and over again. It does live up to the hype.	10
 The movie! Maybe the greatest ever!	This is certainly one of the best movies I've ever seen.. It's one of those movies worth to watch 10 times, and every time feel the same when the movie ends...The key of this film and its good position on IMDb list is not about its main role - Andy, it is about our relationship with him - our curiosity and our admiration. People like excitement at the movies, and this is the movie with good life lesson, offers the hope, the great feeling.. It is not about the story, its all about that feeling, when you are in your sofa, watching the movie for 2 hours.. and after the movie ends, you stand up and say: What a movie!And what is the best, watching the film again, you admire it even more than the first time you saw it. My best recommendation :)	10
 awesometaculerly brilliant	This movie is not just brilliant but it's rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game.

 The Shawshank Redemption Review		10
 Shawshank review	"this is one of the most incredible movies ever. it is very well done and has a lot of suspense and drama. Morgan freeman is incredible, as always and never stops to amaze. my favorite movie ever. i recommend this movie to everyone. when red doesn't kill himself but instead says that red was here i was so happy. and that whole thing where they meet on the beach at the end is so amazing and i was thrilled. it is perfectly acted and done with exquisite directing. i am so in love with this movie because it is so perfect and incredible. the authenticity is incredible. and how can i write a review without mentioning the greatest twist ever? he escapes and you are like ""what?!"""	10
 A Masterpiece!	"Years go by, and this is still my favorite movie of all time! Everything is perfect! Image, sound, history, message, really everything! I almost can't putt in words my feeling about this movie! Every time I watch ""Shawshank Redemption"" I cried, I laugh, it's just a motion of feels! Believe me, if you love cinema, you really need to watch this movie, because, there's something in him, that makes you believe that you can do everything, every problem is your life, you can get it thought!""Shawshank Redemption"" is the perfect example that, life.....is really a movie!"	10
 Amazing	"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."	9
 Very nice	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison.From Andy's arrival on the prison bus to the film's end, we see only how others see him - Red, who becomes his best friend, Brooks the old librarian, the corrupt Warden Norton, guards and prisoners. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy living' or get busy dying'.""The key to the film's structure, I think, is that it's not about its hero, but about our relationship with him - our curiosity, our pity, our admiration. If Andy had been the heroic center, bravely enduring, the film would have been conventional, and less mysterious. But we wonder about this guy. Did he really kill those two people? Why does he keep so much to himself? Why can he amble through the prison yard like a free man on a stroll, when everyone else plods or sidles?People like excitement at the movies, and titles that provide it do well. Films about ""redemption"" are approached with great wariness; a lot of people are not thrilled by the prospect of a great film - it sounds like work. But there's a hunger for messages of hope, and when a film offers one, it's likely to have staying power even if it doesn't grab an immediate audience."	10
 amazing	"i have watched this movie so many times i just can not remember how many time i saw this legendary movie i can say just one word to this amazing movie just amazing. The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American drama film written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Release date: September 23, 1994 (USA) Director: Frank Darabont Adapted from: Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption Story by: Stephen King Characters: Andy Dufresne, Warden Norton, Brooks Hatlen, More Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends 19 years in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation."	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	The Shawshank Redemption Is one of the best movie i ever seen. The patience of a person no one could ever imagine and all about hope.simply its great.The character of Tim Robbins are good but the Voice of Morgan freeman is magical and made this film classical and the whole story line is awesome...the whole cinematic and direction is too good.Specially the scene where Morgan freeman said that if he want to break in this small tool it would take around years to break.And the words The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell... and those bars slam home... that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye.	10
 u must watch it		10
 This is such a great film!	I watched this tonight for the first time in a few years. It really is superb! Redemption is such a good word. I love the groundwork that goes into the best executed escape ever - the 'this is how I did it' bit is so pleasing!! It's so satisfying to watch when everyone gets their just desserts!! I really like that the story is told through the eyes of red. I like the idea of institutionalization, and the struggle that prisoners face when they leave prison - Brooks story is so sad. I love the pure bliss of Tim Robbins when he does something good for his inmates. And I love the end, so perfect and happy and hopeful! Never disappoints :)	9
 An Evergreen Movie	Watched the whole film without stopping for a moment. From the start to the end this film is just awesome. Can't find any weak point of its. The whole 142 minutes my eyes were attached to the screen. Actors have done their best work of their life. Hats off to 'Tim Robbins' & 'Morgan Freeman'. The director 'Frank Darabont' undoubtedly made a masterpiece. Its an epic kinda film. Its has all the things of a 'Fantastic' type film. A good story filled with thrill, emotion, drama, suspense everything. It's may not possible to watch any film like this again. Its never gonna be old ever. A watchable movie for all viewers of any edges.	10
 Easily number one.	"This move is remarkable every time I watch it. The cinematography, music, character development and everything the movie captures only happens so often. In the beginning you watch as Anthony's wife cheats on him and implies he's the murderer. When in court you have mixed feelings. Did he murder his wife and lover? all the evidence is there. Though how Anthony presented himself shows what kind of character he is. As he enters Shawshank, I personally got a sickening feeling of what he was about to experience. Though excitement too. How was this man going to survive a prison. When Morgan Freeman's Character ( Red ) enters the story, he speaks so much of routine and what the life. Breaking reality from fantasy when he says "" There's no fairy tales in Shawshank "" implying everything you fear what would happened. Did happen. Although, one of the most uplifting parts is with Anthony breaks free. He sends a letter to Red telling him "" Hope is a good thing. It's never wrong to hope. Good things don't die"" This message speaks so profoundly, after Brooks death and the dependency on Shawshank. That message speak so profoundly. This movie is more than a 10/10. It captures everything it wants and needs to then some. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who enjoys a good film."	10
 Great movie		10
 A true masterpiece!!!!!!!!	"Before seeing this movie i was not so profound of Hollywood movies.I prefer,like anyone else in the world to see movies in my own mother tongue.I didn't even know what the title was.I am happy that i was patient enough to check this movie.This movie by all means is philosophical and brilliant.Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman chemistry was just brilliant.screenplay was so good.I always say to my friends ""movies,songs,dialogue that keep lingering in our mind"" are the ones which we feel for it.I felt more than that after seeing this movie.I spoke about it to everyone as much as i could.If you are patient enough you will get to understand it better.I watched it a number of times still after the end of the movie i feel extremely confident every time.I am disappointed that this particular movie didn't fetch a single Oscar.But as more people see this they will understood that good movie doesn't require any accolade.Truly a stunning movie! My favorite movie also.....10/10"	10
 Best movie!	"This is one of the best movies I ever watched. Everything is perfect. It's one those movies that you must see once in your life.So, so, so good. The adaptation of the Stephen King novel is so entertaining, filled with interesting dialogue and plot twists. A pretty much perfect prison film. Great performances by Robbins and Freeman. One moment really got to me: the moment when Andy crawls out of the sewer tunnel and stares up at the sky in the rain. Such a glorious moment of triumph, I wanted to stand up and scream ""Yes!"". This movie truly depicted that prison life in the fifties was just as hard for new prisoners as it is implied today. The movie didn't sugar coat Andy's prison life. A great movie full of great writing and performances that the first time you watch it, it will instantly be fortified as a great movie classic"	9
 Good but does not deserve the glory.		7
 Timeless masterpiece	My review will be short and simple.This movie deserves to be number one in the IMDb top list. It is very much worth watching. I saw it when it was new and now, years later, it still has the same power. It is a timeless masterpiece.The writing, the acting, the emotion are all superb. The story and characters draw you in and keep you captivated form the beginning of the movie right up until the end.I will not discuss the contents of the story as I do not want to post accidental spoilers. I can honestly say, if you haven't seen this movie already you need to go out and watch it right now.	10
 Ho Lee Fuk	This movie was amazing. I have never seen such a good movie. Morgan freeman was amazing in it, sad he died in the end tho. The same goes with the other guy that looked like Keith from OTH but didn't look like him when close. Great movie. I cannot believe that twist ending I think there was like 20-30 people crying out loud in the cinema and I think one of them was transferred to the hospital because he was chocked, oh my god this movie was fantastic, I cannot believe how great it was. I have watched it 2 times and it was even better the second time because then you noticed small little tiny details that you did in fact not notice the first time you watched this masterpiece of a movie, I wish every movie was like this because then I would watch everything and then just review it the same as this one. Never has there been such a good movie. 10/10 Great acting, great story, amazing everything.	10

What more one need from a movie .Heart throbbing drama with wonderful performances ever seen on a cinema screen .no flaws whatsoever with an amazing ending . cinematography n story goes hand in hand with powerful direction .

 Brilliant!	This has to be one of the best movies I have ever watched! No movie real or fictional will ever face up to this one! I had never seen this movie until about 3 or 4 months ago and I had also heard so much about it, having watched it I've listened and heard it everywhere only good things and people saying it is the best movie ever and I 100% agree it is the best movie ever. There are some brilliant and creative movies out there but this movie really appeals to all our senses and is magnificent. I don't know how the writers even came up with such a good storyline. Also well done to the actors who played such a good part in the movie and made it come to life on the big screen. One of my fave actors was in it which made it for me and that was Morgan Freeman! I love his voice and I truly admire his acting skills. As a director and cameraman I admire the fantastic work of the cameramen and the brilliant directing. Well done to everyone involved in this movie, I imagine they are very proud of what they have created and indeed they should be!	7
 As I see this incredible movie	Frank Darabont's work is amazing in this movie let alone Stephen king, incredible ... Since Tim Robbins (Andy) is in that car at night until Morgan freeman (Red) arrives at the Mexican beach all a thrill, intrigue you see on the screen. Geologist's hammer, the Rita Hayworth poster hanging on the wall in a miserable prison cell Shawshank an incredible idea of Stephen. For my part the movie is the best thing and seen the movie that hooked me more of screen a movie with 14 years spent enough. A life lesson that shows what can happen to oneself from one day to the other just to make a nonsense. Finally, Some 20 years turned into 2 hours, I recommend this movie to movie lovers. Greetings.German!	9
 This movie opened my eyes.		10
 Excellent	Undeniably one of the most thrilling and memorably movies ever seen. Promise. The ability for them to put together a concept of both drama hate, love and suspense was intense. I would only hope to see movies like this in the future.Undeniably one of the most thrilling and memorably movies ever seen. Promise.

 Shawshanked	Bare with me, for this is my first written review, ever. Please don't persecute me because of it. I think this is one of the better stories that Stephen King has let into movie productions. Even though a lot of his novels would make excellent movies, but yet I have not seen them on the screen. Actually, that may be a good thing for us readers. I have seen several novels that made it into the movies and relatively were bad. Not saying that those were Stephen Kings' novels. The reason being is that because its hard sometimes to capture what is in a storybook and put it to life on the screen. In this case, I believe that they pulled it off successfully. Anyway, this is a film that I can watch and re-watch a million and one times and never become bored of it. I am a HUGE fan of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, these two were made perfectly for the roles that they played. It would be nice to see them in future roles, in the same movie sometime soon.	
 Datoo	The reason I became a member of this database is because I finally found a movie ranking that recognized the true greatness of this movie. There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing. Every element comes together to form an exquisite story for cinema. I believe that one reason that this movie is under-appreciated is that people have not seen it multiple times. On first viewing it is the story of Andy Dufresne and his struggle to maintain hope despite his circumstances. However, this is really a movie about Red and his struggle to find meaning and purpose. The final segment of the movie testifies to the fact that the final resolution of the story comes about only when Red is faced with the same fearful situation as Brooks. Because of Andy, Red can find a different path-the path of freedom that is lit by hope. Who is your Andy Dufresne?	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best films I ever seen.		8
 Must watch movie.	No spoilers. Just watch this movie. Must watch movie and the best adaption from Stephen king short story. -- a movie which better describes about hope. -- watched it countless times and will watch again. i am not actually fond of crime movies but The Shawshank Redemption is one of its kind which kind of proved that wrong to me. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins with their best performances. adapted from short story --Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption i consider this as the best adaption yet. The Green mile is somewhat from the same team but not impressed. The Shawshank Redemption will be one of my best movie of all time 10/10 -Amazing.	10
 Great Movie	This brain scratching movie is classic story. Must watch movie for classic movie fans. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	7
 Really good movie	"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	8
 Meaning of excellency	There are excellent movies that people say excellent. There are some best ones that people say the best. There are good movies that people say good. There are sad ones that people cry. There are funny ones and awesome ones. But, this movie made a meaning to the word excellent. Morgan freeman has given his best on this piece of excellent. Tim Robins is living in the role. This movie has sad, happy, anger, good, bad, best, better, worst, kind of, neutral, freedom. The viewers mind is connecting to the movie which makes the viewer to live in the situation. The old man's death part is the painful and ever remembering moment. The Shawshank Redemption is excellent.	10
 The greatest movie set in a prison I've ever seen!	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those rare films that ages better with time. This movie was a beautifully crafted story on friendship, redemption and hope. The storyline was really well-crafted, and putting in these unforgettable characters made it even better. From Red to Andy to Norton, they we're all just wonderful and enjoyable characters, especially Red and Andy. The relationship between those two is what really holds the balance of the movie. And putting in characters such as Warden Norton and Captain Hadley makes the story riveting and (in a sense) dark. It's not like any other movie out there. Overall, it's a classic Stephen King story"	10
 Its really a movie that impressed me too much ...	"Robbins and Freeman have the juice as actors to make figuring out whether Andy and Red really did it a riveting guessing game, especially if you're a sucker for prison melodramas. Writer Frank Darabont (The Fly II), in his feature-directing debut, doesn't skimp on the caged-bird clichés, sadistic and sentimental, but he plays enough hardball with the formula to evoke memories of such goodies as Cool Hand Luke, Birdman of Alcatraz and Riot in Cell Block II.Stephen King wrote the novella Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, on which the film is based. (Andy's cell is bedecked with a poster of Hayworth in all her Gilda glory.) You can find the novella in a 1982 King collection, Different Seasons, along with a story, ""The Body,"" that became the, basis for the 1986 Rob Reiner smash Stand by"	7
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 Great movie	"Excellent inspirational movie to watch... extreme worth to spent time on this Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame."	10

 Its such an awesome movie	"Shawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can conjure. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence, humor, an extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central performances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told that makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have theorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of Jesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a lecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who we think it to be for 3/4 of the film? After all there is one major 'redemption' in this film: a man who has to decide whether ""It's time to get busy dying, or get busy living"". REDEEM YOURSELF, SEE THIS FILM."	10
 Inspirational to all	I made my mind to watch this movie in 2012 as most of users recommended on IMDb. I always wonder what could be one thing that makes Shawshank legend of Hollywood movies. I found my favorite actor of lifetime after watching it: Morgan Freeman. Every single thing in the movie is 10/10. Story of Stephen King, screenplay, dialog, drama, suspense, crime and action.The baritone of Freeman moves whenever you hear him. I never gets tired watching it again and again, it is that kind of picture. I still sit back in ave and can't help myself from watching it again and again. Thanks to strong direction and support staff, this makes to top my list all-time.	10
 My redemption for the director of The Shawshank Redemption	"I liked this film very much...until the end. I thought, ""NO! Please don't give us a fairytale ending!"" For me, the film should have ended after Red found what Andy had left for him, or maybe showing him on his way to be reunited with Andy. The scene on the beach was out of character with the rest of the film, even though Andy had talked about it earlier. And HE IS WORKING ON SOME PIECE OF SH*T BOAT IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE?! HOW did it get there? I thought, ""WHY such an ending to what up to now had been a great film? So I was very relieved when I discovered that Frank Darabont wanted a different ending, and it was the studio wanted it that way (how many times has THAT happened in the history of Hollywood -- f*cking up a good thing)."	7
 Great Film	I think this film is very impressing because you can see into the life of a prisoner who don't made a crime. In one scene for example the judge who talk about Andy Dufresne see in his face he is a person who don't have any feelings but the judge don't now that Andy was a quiet person who act like a kind of introvert. And when he came to the Shawshank he gives all the others the impression he is the first victim of the other prisoners but he always take his head up, and because of his experience he uses his knowledge to make his and the life of the friends he meet in the prison a little better. In the end you can see that the actor Tim Robbins mystify all the people who thought they know him, so he can break out and give the Shawshank chief and the employees the lesson which they don't forget for their life. In the End his best Friend Red and himself begin a new stage of life in Mexico.	10

 Excellent Movie No Doubt. N.o 1 in the IMDb top 250? Not Really.	"The Shawshank Redemption is another Stephen King book based movie made my Frank Darabont. I have said earlier that when Darabont makes a movie based on a Stephen King book, it simply results in magic on screen, and The Shawshank Redemption is almost a perfect example of that. Despite receiving very positive reviews from critics, developing a cult following, this film failed to well at the Box Office and barely managed to recover it's costs.It's a shame really because this film deserves better, it is one of the best films of the 90s and an excellent film, with a very deep and engaging plot. Shawshank Redemption is a movie based on Prison Life and follows the life of two prisoners who become close friends. Darabont also made another movie based on Prison Life, The Green Mile, also based on a Stephen King book. However the former is a more realistic portrayal of prison life, it shows the harsh life of prisons even back in the 1940s-60s and the hostile environment, prison life is portrayed more accurately.The Plot is simply fantastic, after first 5 minutes I was just hooked, and the plot is the main reason I kept on re-watching this movie, however I did find myself struggling on the 4th viewing because the movie really starts to drag a lot at several points, and if you have watched those slow progressing scenes before they will be hard to sit through again. The movie does not try to completely serious at times, it also has it's amusing moments and some nice heart warming moments, the ending was also well done, although a dialogue exchange between Red and Dufaine would have been nice.However the plot is not really perfect, there are several unexplained things in the movie, how did Andy manage to frame the Warden or Hadley for Tommy's murder, and wouldn't revealing the Warden's illegal earnings also get Andy (who pretends to be Randall Stephens)in trouble. Also the supposed twist, that Andy didn't do it seemed unnecessary because it went nowhere, if Andy had in fact committed the murder and got his redemption, it would have added to the plot in my personal opinion. I am not going to criticize King's idea or the writers' ideas behind the story but I felt like the twist of of psychotic murderer was unnecessary. Also the films progresses years really fast, at least showing you the year on a blank screen would have cleared the confusion because even in my 4th viewing I was confused at several points, that which year it actually was, Freeman's narrating was helpful but it still lead to confusion about which year it actually is.The acting is also good, Morgan Freeman steals the show with his performance Red ""Ellis Redding"", he also narrates many parts of the film and does it excellently. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown act so well and really make you despise them. Even Adam Sandler plays the cool laid back prisoner very well. However Tim Robbin's is decent at best as Andy Dufaine, it is understandable he was a depressed character but his smirk, blank and confused facial expressions throughout the film are just tiresome, he really seems robotic, there are actors who could have done better honestly, nothing against Robbins, he can act well no doubt, he did good in Jacob's Ladder but here he doesn't stand out, not saying he is bad at all but his performance could have been better, as he was the lead it would have added more to the film. The music is nice it fits the movie and many scenes very well. And the direction is also done very well, the portrayal of prison life is very accurate and realistic. The film's message about hope and friendship is also mesmerizing.The Shawshank Redemption is an underrated gem, an excellent film with an in-depth that deserved much more acclaim and commercial success at its time of release. However it is not perfect, has it's share of mistakes and is simply not the greatest movie ever made as IMDb top 250 lists it.Overall: 9/10"	9
 The Movie to watch	"One of the best movies in the common era. A must watch for sure for any movie fanatics. One of the best performances by Morgan Freeman. A movie that is definitely worth taking the time out of your lazy day and watching from beginning to end. Must pay attention as it is very detail oriented. Matter of fact, everyone has their part in this movie. All very good acting performances. I wish I would have seen this movie a lot earlier. A movie everyone can enjoy because of the great performances. A sad but rejuvenating movie. Last but not least, it definitely is a feel good movie. Very heart-warming especially at the end when it tugs at those ""heart-strings."""	10
 Deserves all time No.1 Slot	SreeZ REview ::: Last night, I just experienced one of the best feel by watching THE SHAW-SHANK REDEMPTION(1994).

 One of the best movie	"Before watching this movie i was just postponing, its been a year or two after I really made up my mind to watch this movie, starting of this movie is really slow, at first any person who person who is a fan of movies like escape from Alcatraz and TV series like prison break you really gonna start questioning yourself that Andrey really gonna escape or not but keep your hope that its really going to be awesome. This movie is like filling a bucket with water drop by drop, so have some patience to watch this movie.Moral of the story: ""Hope is a good may be the best thing & good thing never dies"""	10
 A Masterpiece	Shawshank Redemption is a prison movie done right. With both the story and technical aspects of the film at the highest caliber, it delivers a powerful tale that is timeless. Star Morgan Freeman gives a great performance, but Tim Robbins undeniably delivers. From the lighting to score, one cannot help but appreciate this fine example of a powerful adaptation at its finest. It is a beautiful piece of history and takes its place among the best. Even the pacing of the story is well placed to give a sense of hopelessness within the prison, but not dragging on and prolonging confinement. The creativity and originality behind this leaves viewers in awe of a great film.	10
 Excellent movie !	In my opinion this is the one movie that is absolutely the greatest the first time you watch it. It's probably my favorite movie. It may not have the replay value of some of my other favorites but, the first time you watch it when you don't know what is about to happen, is the probably the greatest thing you can experience in terms of movies. I only wish could I forget it so I could watch it again for the first time. As a matter of fact if I ever suffered complete amnesia there would be at least one definite benefit. I am not going to talk about the ending and for god's sake if anybody puts a spoiler warning on their comments do not read them!	10
 Greatest Movie Ever - shortest pitch ever		10
 the redemption of your soul can take many years.	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman find themselves involved in a subtle game of power, changes of life and change of perception of the things. The movie brings you into a small work of a prison and make it bigger, involving power, sentiments and freewill. The perfect story of how life changes again and again, no matter where you are,who you are and why you are like that. You can always take control of your life again, using even the anger to your own sake. In this perception the the downfall and the redemption from hell are part of a longer life process that anyone can experience whenever. The redemption of your soul can take many years but if you never stop believing it that will happen. A masterpiece anyone should see, even though is not your favorite gender of movie.	10
 Great film	This film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can say it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend, because to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must see before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great experience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his career in this film. I give props to the director for making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim Robbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole the show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go without being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full effort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as well, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it changes when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a matter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly when it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and to be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.	10
 good	It is a movie that must watch before u die it tells a beautiful story,and how hope and fear can get u in Ur life. Beautifully directed and also beautifully acted.

 Amazing movie	An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! It's a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting.	10
 Perfect Story	A perfect story whose life gone worse down to the earth,,but despite of being sad,they lead their life & they moulded and changed themselves to reback into joy and happiness.Actors lead their roles very nicely. instead we calling themselves they actors, i call themselves as livers.who involved in the character over a span of 1.30 hrs to make us involved.this is the best movie i have ever seen.but coming to story there are more perfect stories than this like illusionist etc.but it was purely sci-fi and this is all about emotions so, obviously it stood first among all other movies.	10
 One of my favourite all time movies!		10
 What else is there?	"There is no critic alive that is capable of insulting this masterpiece. This movie has all the elements of what Entertainment should represent. Anyone who finds fault in such a blessing, has a problem that simply starts in their own mirror each day. From the reality of the plot to the roller-coaster of emotions for both the young and naive, and the old and wise alike. The Shawshank Redemption covers full circle real life occurrences from murder, infidelity, greed and corruption to laughter, clicks, bonds, loyalty and lastly, isolation. All this perfectly narrated by Morgan Freeman taking the viewer along the POV path of his characters mind, other characters highs and lows with o/s lines detailed to the T of believing you yourself are experiencing it. My hats off to the entire cast, crew and everyone involved in this project. The few negative reviews come from those who only wish to be so lucky and fortunate one day. Enjoy this one over and over again, it simply doesn't get old. ""I damn near soiled myself"" Brookes ;)"	10
 hope is everything	"the movie was so pleasant and realistic that made many users captivated. we know that prison brings boredom,sadness and inevitable for he accused, but this movie puts everything simple and interesting where things are twisted abruptly.Just remember that movie prints an effective phrase to which things are clinging to.. ""hope is a good thing and No good thing ever dies"" prisoners have an odd feeling mostly feel guilty for the things that busted them in, some may not. In here, we see a different approach to free a man himself with a powerful weapon 'hope'. so this hope gets him out that no one would ever try to implement it."	9
 One of the best movies I've have ever seen	It's a wonderful movie that shows the power of hope. It's pictured in a very nice way and deserves the 10/10 rating. It has a lasting effect on you and you'll think about the movie a lot of times after you've finished seeing it. I recommend everybody to watch it. Tim Robbins shows the limits to which a person can suffer and how he can bounce back with his brilliance and hope. Morgan Freeman gives a classy act and is very fit for the character. The direction is excellent and does justice to the amazing script. The other actors have also portrayed their characters brilliantly. You'll feel hatred towards the negative characters and that's only because of their amazing acting. This movie is top in the top 250 list of IMDb fr a reason. Have a nice watch. :)	10
 God have made this movie	This movie shows more than love and how to understand people that doesn't have this great in life. Not so successful, and the taste of freedom. This movie shows another side of life that people never can understand. The script is amazing and the actor of all actress(Morgan Freeman). The story is great and it's hardly any bad scenes or camera view. The moral in this movie is as fantastic as Eminem's rapping. This is a short review but watch the movie to get a side of life that you never have seen before.This movie is about a guy that is a suspect in a murder case of his wife and her lover. He get's into prison and finds out how the hard life is in prison and how it takes you're life. He works in bank that helps the police officer to save money for their family. The problem is that he gets beaten and rubbed by people and guards. The he sees how prisoners feel.	10
 Old But Gold		8
 The best film, Simply amazing	I saw this movie many time, every time I saw and think this is the best amazing movie I ever seen. I must say, every movie lover man must be see this movie. I love this movie story line. I saw this movie rate 9.2 but I think this movie is highest rating movie. Normally I am a programmer but love to saw lot of movie. This movie must be used as an Anti-depression by therapists! this movie proves that Oscars are either money bought gifts! or that who ever in charge of them are so smart that they couldn't give any Oscar to The Shawshank Redemption knowing that the movie is on different - much higher- rating scale than the Oscars.. it's simply over qualified!	10
 10 out of 10 movie. Its that good.	"Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. One of the greats motion picture I have ever seen. There are 0 flaws to this film. And I counted. This film is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. If I could give it more than 10 I would."	10
 The kind of Film I dream to make one day..		10
 The Best Movie You'll Ever See. I Will Become Your New Favorite	This is just my favorite movie of all time. I really wanted to do a review on it and here it is. GO-WATCH-THIS-MOVIE! Don't rent it. Buy it. This is such an amazing movie, it's on the best movies list for IMDb for a reason. It keeps you entertained and most of all, it is so emotional. Yes, it IS another jail movie but it's not like any else you'll ever see. And yes, there is a rape scene but it's a phenomenal movie and it will probably become your new favorite. I can't speak for everyone but it surely did become my new favorite. And I won't give away the ending on you but I can say it is about the best movie ending EVER. It's what officially made it my number 1. Anyway, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this movie. You NEED to see it and I rate this movie ten out of ten no doubt.	10
 A homage to Movie Making	Well, more than two thousands comments and mostly positive why I need to write the comment for the simple reason I wants to pay a small homage to movie making and proving to the world that still every now and then Hollywood still come-up with rare gems. I watched this movie so many times and every time I sit through this movie from start to end which is quite rare these days to stick to a movie for more than 2 hours without feeling the patches of boredom or feeling the movie being bit long. I am still not sure what happen to Oscar which don't give best actor award to Morgan Freeman or best supporting actor award to Tim Robbins, well its really unfortunate. There is a saying about great movies, that great movies just made themselves and that's about it, you cant just make them again and again and among several of those great movies this movies will always stands. Frank Darabont will always be remember for his two outstanding work one is The Shawshank Redemption and another The Green Mile.	10
 Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and ultimately uplifting.	Thanks to decent performances and direction own Frank Darabont inventive, The Shawshank Redemption continues to be an example of class how to approach issues with potentially heavy conviction, style, lightness and wit. Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and ultimately uplifting. Thanks to decent performances and direction of very inventive Frank Darabont, The Shawshank Redemption remains a first-class example of how to approach issues potentially heavy with conviction, style, lightness and wit. The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama with uplifting deeply satisfying sensitive direction and great performances.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" has a hype so high that it is unfair to the film and its potential viewers. But it is an expertly written ocean of what a movie should be, and how a movie should capture such emotions from the audience, and how an audience will realize it is not glorified, but a masterpiece that is sure followed by almost any filmmaker by the slightest of touches. In this single film, it contains all of the basics (humor, drama, dread and redemption), but it tacks on much more. From the depths of its characters to Andy's shoes. It is about freedom, friendship and those metaphorical shackles. It's final scene could have not been so touching in a lesser movie, but it all pans out. Pans out in ways we hoped. In ways we dreamed."	10
 This film is beautiful	I thought that this film is epic. It is beautiful, sad and heart-warming. I thought that the character were brilliant and the actors portrayed them very well. Our knowledge of Andy's innocence is painful to watch as he spends most of his life in prison, but I loved the ending, and I believe that a film with a good ending always makes it better because you leave the film on a good note. I thought that Morgan Freedman and Tim Robbins made the film what it was because as actors they were given the building blocks to bringing the character to life, and I thought they did it brilliantly. I congratulate them strongly.	10
 Truly heart-warming and inspirational.	What more can you ask for? A spectacular cast, a gripping score and a strong plot all contribute this film's massive success. Easily Frank Darabont's greatest achievement, The Shawshank Redemption creates so much atmosphere, and forces you to feel a whole spectrum of emotions not explored in most films. Although sometimes exaggerated (as to be expected from a Stephen King source), the film deals without a lot of serious themes from the outset. The eventual revelation of Andy's wrongful conviction is a great turning point in the story, and gives us even more of a reason to root for our protagonist. Overall, the direction and acting are masterful, with such power put into Thomas Newman's score to send shivers through your body, there's not much else to expect from this movie: A triumph!	10
 Amazing	This movie is simply astonishing. Must watch movie in a lifetime. The work of Morgan Freeman is the most brilliant from my views. But all The credit and magic is goes to the Amazing Director of the Movie, I also Watched his movie 'The Green Mile' Which is simply amazing like this one but still it is not interesting or emotional like the Shawshank.In the end Shawshank movie i was simply full of emotions in my life for the first time by watching a movie . Otherwise i did int think so that some Movie or Actor or Director can make me so soft hear-ted. Well For the movie, just amazing . You will not regret after watching this movie.Oh my Advice, Watch it in on the Big screen with headphones on and no disturbance at all , then you will realize how good is the Shawshank Redemption.	10

 Excellent movie..must watch		10
 The perfect movie with perfect casting	"There are few movies ever made that require no justification as to why some (or in this case almost everyone) considers it a classic, Shawshank Redemption is one of those films.Shawshank lives onto this day in such high esteem that it feels almost pitiless to do a ""normal"" review of the film for by now almost everyone out there has seen or knows of the movie that inspired us to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" a movie that after watching it makes you feel like you could achieve anything or escape any prison either physically or metaphorically.Upon re-watching the movie for the umpteenth time it occurred to me that there are so many reasons as to why Shawshank is the film it is, a film that has so many elements that are truly classic. Here are some of the points in the film that to me make this movie endlessly rewarding and virtually as flawless as a movie could ever aim to be.Shawshank Prison: is there anything more foreboding than the flying camera zooming over the prison grounds as a bus of ""fresh fish"" arrives? Shawshank acts as a character in itself both endlessly scary yet sadly home to many convicted men.Morgan Freeman as Red: introducing the world to the now overused but never better voice over work of Freeman, Shawshank offered Freeman the role of his career as wise and deep thinking Red, a character everyone feels an affection towards.Thomas Newman's score: crafting a score that ranges from the haunting to the uplifting, Newman's score for Shawshank is a work of a true musically genius and has cues that to this day are used in all manners of film and other advertising. Try not to feel emotion as the music kicks in as Brook's leaves prison.The Script: turning Stephen Kings short story into an epic 2 hour plus feature film may have to some seemed like a pipe dream but what Darabont did with the script is nothing short of a magnificent work by a wordsmith that will never top what he did here. Classic examples include: ""Bad luck, I guess. It floats around. It's got to land on somebody. It was my turn, that's all. I was in the path of the tornado. I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has"" or ""The first night's the toughest, no doubt about it. They march you in naked as the day you were born, skin burning and half blind from that delousing s**t they throw on you, and when they put you in that cell and those bars slam home that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it"".The story: The journey Tim Robbins's Andy takes over 20 years in Shawshank is one we the viewer's feel like we take to. Never more so have we felt the sweat of prison workshops like we do here, the feeling of relief in times of outdoor recess or the fear of guards lying in wait to throw us in the ""hole"" or react with their batons. Shawshank is more than a prison movie however it is a life affirming tale of hope, loss and friendship.The Shawshank Redemption will continue to live on and be a part of best of lists, a future it deserves. Upon reflection and re-watch I can say one thing for certain and use a word that did not exist when Shawshank first entered our world. Shawshank redemption is the best ""bro-mance"" tale we will ever see, a tale that we will never forget and a movie that will never grow tired or old.5 Rita Hayworth posters out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"	10
 One of the best I have ever seen	I am not finding anything to deduct a point from 10/10 on watching this movie. Story line, screen play, acting, sequence, climax - SUPERB. Any kind of viewer would like this, but keep patience till the end. Sometime you might feel bored. My suggestion, keep watching with full of attention. At the end - A smile with satisfaction. You have watched a great movie in your life time. The dark room, typical jail stories etc are the real thrillers. I wonder, about the title. It is thin line between the movie and title. Must watch this movie. If you like pursuit of happiness, this one you would love it. No actor will be given the whole credit for the movie. All are par to their responsibilities. Not a single character can be ignored. And finally the sequence. The whole credit goes to the director. Intelligent way of story telling. You must keep attention to every incident in this movie. You may miss out something. Then don't blame me that I was wrong.	10
 Good movie but not good enough, had to high expectation.	This movie is number #1 in IMDb and many of my friends says this movie is a crystal clear 10/10 and the best movie ever made. I don't think I can agree on that note. Maby I had too high expectations or something but this one is really slow and have few sequences that gives you this feeling of a really REALLY great movie.The actors of this movie I must say is very good and especially Morgan Freeman, whitch is one of my favorite actors of all time. He does a great job. I give this movie 8/10 because it is a good movie, but nothing more than that.	8
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 A time-winning movie	The Shawshank Redemption which was released in 1994 is one of the greatest classic in the world's film industry. & it is also an excellent work of Morgan Freeman. In this movie, the crude, naked and true picture of an American jail has been revealed with a surprise. Threre is also an important message about intelligence of a man. This movie tells us that not a single man's intelligence is negligible. Chicago Sun-Times film reviewer Roger Ebert suggested that The Shawshank Redemption is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy Dufresne's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.Angus C. Larcombe suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or even in freedom, based on one's outlook on life.	9
 Hope Regenerated!!	I watched it in 2013 and still was shocked after watching it's conclusion. Same thing happened with me earlier while watching 'The Dark Knight Rises' !!Hope regenerated....Worth it...Rating - 9.1Some of the areas of the movie were slow poke for me but in the end i could conclude everything and link it up with the movie...Due to my late recognition i found it a bit lengthy though it was perfect when it was released. this movie is no doubt one of the best creation of the history which i don't think can be replaced by anything.Morgan freeman and his voice... best thing about the movie...	9
 very good	"I had the pleasure of watching this movie last night. I went since its a ""guy"" movie my husband was the one excited about it more than I was. I must say I was more than impressed with the leading men in this film. It has been a long time since a movie has had me on the edge of my seat, biting my nails as this movie did during the fighting scenes. If you are looking for great acting, family drama, awesome fighting scenes than this is the movie for you. After we left the theater we couldn't stop talking about it. I will definitely go see it again when it comes out. We really enjoyed it! Nick Nolte was amazing, and even my husband I think cried in a few scenes, (last time that happened was during Marley and Me) so I must say this movie is a MUST SEE!"	10
 Instant Favorite	I do not know why I missed this film when it first premiered. Perhaps it was in the decade in which I lived under a rock. Nevertheless, I did not first see this film until 2007, and although I'd heard of it, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it was a Stephen King adaptation and, honestly, I've never really been much of a King fan, although it seems that I keep watching many of the films adapted from his stories. (Seriously... The Langoliers? The butt worms. WTF?!) Still, I took to Shawshank with little trepidation, allowing the story to unfold as it was meant, and I was hooked within minutes. Afterwards, I did what any good Shawshank fan should do, I watched it again. Robbins' and Freeman's performances were incredible. The story, well told, and the standard King-style twist, surprisingly unanticipated. Little to say,this movie immediately became my all-time favorite, and I happily enjoy watching it whenever it comes available.	10
 A Movie That Deserves.	As we know Shawshank has been ranked best movie by IMDb and many other critics sites. It is one of those movies which you remember even after leaving theater. The type of connection the movie makes with the audience is remarkable. It is not only critics favorite even with its intense story line it presents a slight humor which is astonishing. This movie is ought to be best due to the marvelous direction different yet unique story and the characters the whole cast has done an astonishing job it indeed is a movie without errors of any sort. So Yes the movie does deserve the perfect 10 on 10.Some times a movie of such high note is way over peoples head though shawshank being a movie of high notes establishes a very well connection with each and every of its audience.This is what can be called as world class cinema.	10
 great	this is a good movie This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	9
 This movie is great, may be the best of movies and best movie never going to be forgotten.	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the best prison break i have ever seen. This is the story of freedom, the story of hope and friendship. This movie is like a art because it is a combination of purely amalgamated of various emotions like friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. simply it is a extraordinary creation by Frank Darabont and panned by Stephen King.If we talk about the cast of the movie then Freeman, who is simply a great actor, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Morgan Freeman has griped the narration aspects its why the has gained Oscar for best actor in leading role. On the other side Tim Robbins had played as Andy tremendously well but sometimes he is unable to form bridge to audience. The story of Brooks is very emotional and heartbroken. At the time Brooks hung himself he carves in the wood ""Brooks was here"" in his apartment and then Red added to it ""And so was Red"". The creation of this types of scenes will surely add a step further to won Oscar in best cinematography. I love that film because it had great impact on emotions and hopes. We can say that the Shawshank envelops friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. The film contain very good quote that ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" Andy Dufresne. I want to express that if you don't love the Shawshank Redemption than you are beyond the bound of Redemption. After the watching this movie a question upswing in my mind that ""why are these men in jail?"" but after that i realize that everything matters that is the situation.So it is awesome movie and such type of movie should't be unseen. So watch this movie very precisely and i am sure that the movie will pour it's fraction of greatness in your life."	9
 One of the inspirations of my life		9
 epic	I haven't seen too many movies that I would rate a 10, but I had no problems giving this one top score.number 1 on IMDb's list for a reason... a must see for any and everyone The films message of hope even in the most dark situations hope can be our salvation and it is so true. The film is put together perfectly what brings the film together for me is Morgan Freemans voice it's so powerful, in his acting on screen in the film as well as his narration.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?	10
 Very Good	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family.Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks.It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars.It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.over all it was an amazing movie."	10
 In my top three films, Ever!		10
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994), directed by Frank Darabont.	The Shawshank Redemption by Frank Darabont is a classic film that tells the story of a man who overcomes the worst hardship and uses his wit to deceive his authorities. The audience follows a man named Andy Dufrense through both the most terrible, and the most heartwarming events imaginable. As the film progresses, viewers develop a connection with the main characters as suspense builds with each succeeding event (Ebert). Camera angles are important in every movie from romance films to action films to comedies; however in a film that is as emotionally connected as the Shawshank Redemption, camera angles are one of the primary reasons this movie is so renowned. This original story by Stephen King obviously laid a great foundation for Darabont's film; however the film uses different angles to enhance scene suspense— something that a book cannot do. Frank Darabont's use of specific camera angles throughout the film draws the audience closer to the characters, creating an intimate relationship that makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the best movies of all time. Darabont's choice of camera angle develops a connection between Andy and the audience watching him, making for a much stronger overall film. The first demonstration of brilliant camera angle is the court scene, which shows up early in the film. The camera slowly zooms into his face, revealing his expression of complete shock and awe. This is critical because it gets the audience to realize the pain he is in at the moment. The next moment of noticeable camera work is when Andy is locked into his cell. The camera follows him through the hallway, and then enters the cell with him. The tiny detail to have the camera join Andy in the dark cell connects the audience in a way that literature cannot. At this point, the audience feels the harsh entrapment that Andy feels. The next catastrophic scene in the movie is Andy's rape. The camera does something here that works perfectly at making viewers feel horrible for the protagonist. It shows Andy alone in the laundry room, yet uses the single light source to show only the dark side of his body. As opposed to telling us that he is terribly depressed, the camera angle uses darkness to reveal how he feels. Towards the end of the movie, the camera uses one last movement that truly stands out. Darabont chose to both zoom out and tilt the camera down to give the sensation of rising into the sky. Viewers feel the same sense of freedom that Andy feels that that moment. The view-points of these events give the movie an upper hand to written version. Although the camera doesn't put these events in Andy's point of view, it still manages to make observers feel exactly what he is. Each of these choices in camera movement makes its own unique statement, yet they all bond spectators to Andy by stimulating our intrigue, sorrow, or joy. Camera angle is frequently used to build suspense throughout the movie which draws the audience in and holds them there. The first immensely suspenseful scene is when 'the sisters' rape Andy after beating him up. The camera uses a dolly shot to fade away from the men, while simultaneously moving behind a corner so the audience cannot see all of the horrible events happening to Andy. The rest of the event is left up to imagination, which makes the spectators think about how Andy feels. The camera movement itself is suspenseful in its nature. The next suspense-building scene is the book-shelving scene in the library that Andy took over. The camera shows Andy and Red's conversation from shelf to shelf, making them pause between each of their statements. At this point, they were talking about Andy's cunning in taking over the warden's financial situation. Each time they move, the camera pans with them, forcing them to pause their conversation, which obviously leads the audience to anticipation—wondering what will be said next. Another great example is Red's journey out of the Shawshank Prison. The point of view switches over to Red, however the camera's talent of building suspense remains the same. Brooks left the prison before Red, and took a journey through town to a halfway house, where he hangs himself, leaving a note: 'Brooks was here.' Once Red is released, he follows Brooks' exact journey from location to location, and then etches into the walls next to Brooks' note 'so was Red.' The camera focuses on the writing on the wall so the audience cannot see whether or not Red hung himself just like Brooks. After this, the director utilizes pedestal movement to slowly reveal the rest of the room, and it is discovered that Red did not hang himself, relieving the audience instantly. In this instance, the camera helped the movie build suspense where the book version would not be able to. After this scene, as the movie is finishing up, the audience is taken to the orchards with Red, in search of the note Andy left for him. This is one last moment of suspense because of the camera angle. It tracks Red along the stone wall, but never shows us what he sees, leaving the viewer's asking 'will he find the special package or not?' Resolving the situation is in Red's hands, and the camera helps to build suspense until he finally sees the unique rock. Often, words with a story can create enough suspense to draw a group of people in; yet adding unique viewpoints will maximize the anticipation in most any movie.Though The Shawshank Redemption never earned any Oscars, it received seven nominations for multiple awards including best picture.This movie has not received all of the popular accolades it deserves, yet that doesn't take away from its brilliance.	9
 Powerful and entertaining		9
 The Best!		10
 amazing	"""Get busy living or get busy dying"" An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through. And what kind of banner year was 1994?? PULP FICTION, FORREST GUMP, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (one of my favorite romantic comedies of all-time) were all nominated for Best Picture. It's really too bad that most everyone got swept by that chocolate-lover, but no matter what the Academy deemed ""better"" that year, it goes without saying that SHAWSHANK has developed an even greater audience and following since that time, and is probably one of the most appreciated movies from the past twenty years (I usually NEVER hyperbolize any of my reviews (this is the BEST EVER...this is the WORST EVER...), but in this case, this film takes that cake and damn well, eats it too!). Love it, watch it, get your own motivation from it and surrender to its spirit which gives anyone in the world hope to do whatever they dream to do in life. It's like I quoted back at the top of this review, you better ""get busy living, or get busy dying"". It don't get more black and white than that. Your choice. A true cinematic inspiration. (c) 2013 Berge Garabedian"	10
 Overrated	This is certainly a good movie, but it's not the greatest movie of all time. People hype up this movie too much which persuades other people to develop the same opinion as them. When people are asked what their favourite movie is, they often reply with Shawshank because they don't want to be seen to have a different opinion from the norm. People should develop their own opinions. It's good to see that critics don't rate this film as highly as the general public - I guess this proves that critics truly do know more about movies than the amateurs who consider this film to be the greatest of all time. I also found this film fairly predictable as it was obvious that he would escape in the end.	8
" ""Remember that hope is a good thing, Red, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""		10
 Shawshank Redemption is a story guaranteed to have you on the end of your seat wondering how someone can do it!	the Shawshank redemption is the best movie I have ever seen! defiantly worth the watch!! it is so amazing how Andy spent years having patience to dig out that tunnel so he can escape. And the scene where the librarian hangs himself because he doesn't know what to do with his life touched my heart, it is truly amazing how one can adapt to an environment no matter how bad to the point if they leave there lost. I defiantly recommend this to everyone! it is amazing to look into the life of a prisoner and see and in a way experience what they did in prison, to watch Andy progress through the years and to change things in the prison is amazing. and I defiantly love the chess pieces it gives the storyline a great prospective of the character. I love how Andy affects each prisoner and how it shows that when Ellis finally gets parole that he actually goes to the place Andy asked him too. absolutely amazing!	10
 Greatest Movie of All Time	The Shawshank Redemption is the greatest motion picture of all time. Tim Robbins does an outstanding job as portraying convicted Andy Dufresne, but supporting actor Morgan Freeman is the jewel of the movie and brings humanity to the whole crew of prisoners. Bob Gunton also provides a remarkable performance as the Warden. An incredibly dramatic story line followed by a satisfying ending plot twist. This piece of art truly deserves to be atop the IMDb Top 250 and should be watched by everybody, as the quality of this work can appeal to anyone. Over two hours of incredible role play and drama that are sure to make you want to see this masterpiece at least twice.	10
 Movie Masterpiece	No movie is perfect, but Shawshank Redemption comes very close to that perfection by giving you a valuable lesson for life. Superb score by Tom Newman that blends perfect with the movie. It is so good that you will enjoy it even without watching the movie. Outstanding acting performances by Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton. The characters make you feel for them, which can only be achievable by masterful acting. You will root for Andy and Red, hate the warden, and admire every single scene of the movie until his wonderful conclusion. A movie that teaches you about hope, determination and friendship in a way you will never forget. A top 5 movie of all time in my opinion that everybody has to see it.	10
 Why Shawshank Redemption is better than Forrest Gump		9
 Everyone's favorite movie	It could be easy to say this movie is over rated, as I don't think I have met a person who does not like it. However this movie holds up to all the hype. It appeals to people from all walks of life and all backgrounds. Was my favorite movie growing up. Loved the characters especially the main two,the acting, the symbolism, the story and the ending is great as well.Tim Robbins best movie and Morgan Freeman holds the whole movie together. Not considered much, but the warden plays a good villain.A truly great movie that stands the test of time. Something I will look forward to showing my kids.	9
 Amazing movie	No doubt, it is the best movie ever in Hollywood and outside also. Superb taking,casting,story line and the direction,it's really a class film. My best is always The Shawshank Redemption, there is no romance,no tragedy,but this movie have a heart and i think that heart touches to everyone.This film must be a Oscar winning capability,but i don't know why it was not won,but still this movies have a publicity of more than a Oscar won movie.The main attraction of this movie is the casting,Morgan Freemen was amazing and also Tim Robinson.They are superb payers.The other main strength of this movie is the climax,it's and amazing end,no hard or soft feeling after watched the movie.The only feeling is saw a superb movie.	10
 Shawshank Redemption	I thought the movie was great. All of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. It tells the story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.	10

I'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.	9
 Real twist you can feel		8
 The Shawshank Redemption	If you are a movie buff and have not watched The Shawshank Redemption then trust me you are not a certified movie buff.!! This is the best movie made in the history of mankind. I have seen many movies but no movie has moved me or attracted me the way this one has. There is a special charm in the whole narration that keeps going on with the movie which controls me every time. Every line, every shot is just remarkable !Can watch it any number of times and still keep loving it more. So you better waste no time if you haven't watch it yet and then i am sure you would post a review too !! No wonder this movie has won so many accolades to it and will will surely always be in the top char of IMDb for ever and ever and ever.	10
 The determination of the human spirit	"The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul. Shawshank Redemption was my favorite movie when I first saw it, and I only realized its weakness later, this movie will look a lot worst the second time you watch it with its mysteries revealed and questions fully answered because one of the great qualities of this movie is its impossibility to guess which direction the story will take until it reaches the end. However, the movie celebrates the determination of the human spirit ""There's something inside you that they can't get to, that they can't touch. It's yours."	10
 A lot of feelings	What to say about this movie, a true masterpiece and a well deserved 1st place here in IMDb. So many feelings felt while watching it. I could definitely watch it again and again and would have the same reactions. As someone said in another review: Excellent acting, soundtrack, photography, etc. Tim Robbins was the perfect guy for the role and all the other actors did great too. Do buy this movie because you not only will be able to enjoy it but you will learn a lot from your own reflections on various aspects of life and will be glad that you are free. The movie itself has a strong message with much impact. Don't miss it by any chance, there's a limited number of movies that will make you feel this emotional about being free and alive.	10
 motivation	Nothing is Impossible. This movie is the perfect way to understand that you don't need to be inside or outside a prison to get freedom. I believe the people need to believe in your dreams more than people say it's no possible, and the situation on this perfect movie by Morgan and Tim explain how to make dreams possible. Just think, work, patience, and believe. This is the way. I watch this movie every time I want to be more motivated. I saw this movie last night and I tell my friends and my family that we can't play with life, and we need to do everything correct to make a good way and get health days. After that I saw I lot of movies from Morgan and Tim, and a lot of this movie we can see on there movies.	10
 Amazing	One of the best films that I have watched, so completely enticing! It had me in tears at the end, such an emotional film.. So glad that it was made, the screen-writers/directors/producers should all be so proud of themselves, the film is so amazing and if only I was a few years older.. I'd have loved to have been a part of it. So interesting and catchy, once I'd started to watch I couldn't stop!! Although parts of it did drag slightly, they recovered extremely well. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film. Morgan Freeman is such an amazing actor, I couldn't imagine anyone else to play the role of Red it was done so well. Tim Robbin's was also well cast. Well done.	9
 the best movie i have ever seen of all time		10
 Nice		10
 Niceed Movieee!!		10
 Speechless	Let me keep it straight and simple..I am simply too impressed and therefore out of words to describe what this movie portrays. The acting and realism of this fiction is eye catching. I really wonder how much better it would get if it was based on a true story.Indeed, you can rate, review, describe, audit, revise or summarize a movie, but not art.Whether you are a movie fan or not, simply don't miss this one if you are a human !BTW, Mr. Brooks was my favorite character.	10
 This film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term prisoners, but its real theme is one of hope.	"A Review of The Shawshank RedemptionThis film acts like a commentary on prison life for long term prisoners, but its real theme is one of hope. It draws us in quickly with the drama of a cheating wife and the actions of a scorned husband. However, what really brings us in are the deep soothing tones of Morgan Freeman's (Driving Miss Daisy, Unforgiven) voice-over as Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding speaking about his insights into Andy Dufresne.Andy Dufresne is the scorned husband, played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham, Mystic River), who is accused and convicted of murder even though the evidence is circumstantial and he maintains his innocence. He spends the next twenty years at Shawshank State Prison where he meets Red. Red is one of the guys in the prison who has a way of getting anything one might want smuggled into the prison. One of the first things that Red notices about Andy is that he conducts himself as a free man who is unaffected by the surrounding prison. Andy has difficulty at first as he falls prey to a group of inmates called ""the sisters"" and referred to as bull queers. This goes on until Andy shows his worth as banker to the lead guard, Captain Hadley played by Clancy Brown (Highlander, Starship Troopers). Hadley provided Andy's inmates with beer in exchange for Andy's services. The beer made the inmates feel like free men again and Andy's services got him noticed by the warden. The warden, played by Bob Gunton (Patch Adams, Evita), provided Andy with protection from the ""sisters"", allowed him to fix-up the library, and allowed him to help some inmates earn their high school diplomas in exchange for Andy's help with laundering money that proceeded from the warden's many schemes. So, we are presented with a bleak situation that is reinforced by dirty sets and mostly gray and blue colors. The make-up used to age the actors gradually over twenty years, combined with the acting, work together to make us believe that all of this could happen and is real. We are made to feel sorry for these inmates most of whom are suffering the consequences of their own horrible crimes. And, as if doing the dirty work of the self-righteous who stand in judgment over Andy isn't enough, the warden has the one person who can get Andy out of prison executed. In spite of all of this Andy maintains a hope for the future that ""they"" can't touch. The Shawshank Redemption is a really good film that leaves the viewer with a feeling of triumph and a life lesson that goes beyond prison walls."	10

 Simply one of the best films of all time!	Frank Darabont has created a masterpiece with this film.The entire film is based upon the principle of institutionalisation, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman playing two prisoners who over many years become good friends.From start to finish the film is gripping, moving and inspiring.I am 24 and I usually love loud action movies etc. However you can't beat films like this and I have to admit (cue cliché) they just don't make films like this anymore.This is my favourite film and I would recommend this to anyone who has not seen it yet to put it top of their watchlist.	10
 Greatest I have ever watched..!!!!	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	10
 An all rounder covering all forms of adult audiences.	"Yes it's a fantastic movie. It does hit a huge range of genres and does deserve a high placement. However, it was so talked up as ""the perfect movie"" that it did lead to a disappointment the first time round. I did thoroughly enjoy it but it isn't a movie that can be enjoyed and experienced in any mood or situation. It's a fantastic movie but here's a list of moods that this movie will NOT work in: Absolute chill, Innocent, Brain dead, Crazy hypoAnd if you're already feeling down, maybe find something else to pick you up. Definitely give it a go and see why it's so high and you will enjoy it if you sit back, relax, and engage in the story."	7
 My review		10
 great but not no.1	"The Shawshank Redemption is one the best movies i have ever watched, acting crew are amazing as well as everything in the movie but i don't think this movie should be the top rated movie of all time.the movie is truly an inspiring film where the based on true story makes it more amazing although the movie gets the watching people a little bit cold but all in all i can say its a nice movie. as i was reading trough the other reviews of this movie, i came crossed a review which said and i quote ""The best movies are ones that touch the souls"". i disagree, best movies should be rated according to many aspects but unfortunately the main contributing factor of rating movies nowadays is based on ""other peoples votes"". all in all, i have to say if you haven't watched the movie yet, you are not a movie person"	7
 This is simply Awesome	It turned my thought that how to achieve the goal with Patient. I am really amazed. There is no confusion that theme of this story is nice. I like to watch straggling life. It makes me determined to do anything in this world. And I started to think everything is possible here; nothing impossible. But when he went to bank I was afraid! What's going to happen? Finally He broke the security and got the plan which he made. I think noting bad here when he is a victim. There is no way for him to do. So, It's was a perfect attack in the root of corruption. If most of the victims in this world follow this way with Patient I think it will be possible to make a little change. Although it's not so easy to find similar minded human.	10
 I want part 2	This movie is really great, I enjoyed every minute of it. I want them to make a sequel to it. I want them to add more graphics get new actors and also try and get better locations.What I really like about this movie is that it really captures that feeling of reconnecting with people and how hard that can actually be. As I'm slowly closing in on 40 you see that you do not see the friends you hung out with as much anymore. You still talk to them and get along, but do not have the same connection anymore, simply because you do not share as much anymore as you are used to. Of course those relationships have been pushed to comedic proportions and are a great source for a lot of laughs. Simon Pegg steals the show as the boy trapped in a man's body and the story which initially starts out like a pub crawl soon turns into a pub brawl and an awesome one at that.	8
 Best movie	"Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar."	10
 A magnificent film that is worthy to be number 1.	"A true masterpiece of modern cinema , with Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction , a film that has left its mark in the past 10 years. Frank Darabont 's film , based on Stephen King material , captures in a way that could not be more memorable triumph of human spirit over a hostile destiny . Drama is built and crafted by the most thorough detail: fine-tuned scenario , congealed story that makes you cry for a happy end , which, although coming, though still not fully satisfy you (why many films have done that ? ) . Each element of the decor brings its contribution corresponding to the emotional tension of the film developed . ""The Shawshank Redemption"" does not offer a tremendous psychological challenge or any rational incentive contrary, his charm lies in the emotional force that surrounds you slowly, carefully graded and highly inspiring. Impressive great emotional impact , the film you just steal a special atmosphere , a slight reconciled melancholy that makes you actually feel your blood human . Drama protagonist move upon you and they end up pushing the contemplation of the greatness of the human being. But the film is balanced , never falls into a bathos , vulgar or boring . Cadence dose slowly and subtly flowing impressionism , and finally can conclude proud : over all wrongs , than all the sufferings , miseries rises above all human splendor . Great triumph of human values ​​: patience, friendship , perseverance , selflessness is portrayed as a human universal film without falling into the trap American ( few directors escapes this trap , see Ridley Scott , Gladiator or Mel Gibson - Braveheart ) . The picture is superb, the sets have a special importance , assembly includes interesting symmetry , direction is gorgeous , Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman remain a tandem famous all do their duty and drain your last tear ... but not in an insidious , commercial and regret , the film is not at all a hoax , a scam , but has a substance perfect emotional density , highlighting , in a grand exquisite essences of humanity ."	10
 Best of the Best		10
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Awesome		10
 Wow!	"The one film I have loved since I was young, being born a year before it came out, means I missed the initial release, I had cried through some amazing scenes and at the story line. Written and developed in such a way that this film, I beg everyone just sit down and watch this on the edge of the sit film, with a box of tissues and prepare for the film that had made some of the greatest actors in Hollywood! With the recent shock that this film never made the budget and lost about ""£22,500,000"" is shocking! The first time I watched this film I was on my own, sat in the front room when I was 13, It broke me I had to run upstairs to my mum and cry. Truly a great and breathtaking film!"	10

 Must see	"In THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover, and sent to prison. It's 1949, and Andy doesn't have the stuff for prison life. Andy befriends ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) and uses his past as a banker to get a job in the prison library. But things unravel. In doing the books for the warden, he learns that the prison boss is taking bribes, and Andy is to launder them. A lovable former inmate hangs himself when he gets to the outside after decades behind bars and can't adjust. The inmate whom Andy helps get his GED is shot by the guards to keep him quiet about information that might prove Andy is innocent of the murders and set him free. Andy spends two months in solitary. After he gets out, he seems depressed and Red worries he'll kill himself. The next day, Andy isn't dead, but he isn't there, either. He's escaped. The rest is a perfect Stephen King happy ending, complete with ill will for the corrupt warden. Steven King's Best book to film of all time."	9
 A Closer Look at Shawshank's Genius	"Review #1 of ""My Top ten Favorite Movies"" Reviews I'm not going to go through a whole review, since there are plenty of reviews detailing why this is the greatest movie of all time. I'm just gonna give a quote:""The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever seen because of its ability to capture raw emotion."" I'm also going to elaborate on the three biggest reasons people dislike this movie.1. It's too slow.The Shawshank Redemption may be a tad slow, but it is justified. I believe director Frank Darabont wanted to show Andy's time at Shawshank by showing how slow prison time really is. Some movies are just slow; this movie does it for a deeper reason, adding to Shawshank's genius.2. Andy Dufresne barely shows emotion.Those people obviously didn't get what kind of character Andy was. Tim Robbins did this on purpose. Andy was quiet, mellow, and was obviously quite shocked and angry he was going to prison for a crime he didn't do. Did you really expect the man to jump up and start singing ""Kumbaya""? No! So I don't get what the problem is. The fact that he acted like this just added to the realistic atmosphere of the movie.3. This is not realistic.Oh yes your right, since these men in prison smoked, cursed, drank, and kept their eyes peeled in the shower room for potential rapists. That is not realistic at all. (sarcastic) Overall, I think some of the hate on Shawshank is solely because it is the highest rated movie on IMDb, for a fact. (User rating is 9.3 to this date). I think some people hate this movie because everyone else loves it, and that is a bad way to think about anything, not just movies.HandHStudios Rating: 10/10, and everything higher."	10
 the effect included in the movie	the main effect used in the movie is that the inside story is kept preserved for most of the time in the movie and revealed suddenly at the last movement . this was a great journey. the story narration of the movie is perfect.the direction of the movie from starting to the last is very much appreciatedthis movie also teaches us that whatever be the way we have to struggle continuously in our life. and one day we will o=purely get success.as a whole it was a very good movie and this type of movie should be appreciated. may be it does not have a very true story but this movie proves that only script does not matters	9
 Excellent movie, a must see!	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best all-round movies of all time. The story is powerful in that it represents real issues in society, not petty ones that a lot of movies nowadays base their stories off of, that are usually unrealistic anyways. The characters are interesting and have strong character arcs, and the highs and lows are extreme highs and lows, there's not doubt you'll be moved by this story. And to top it all off the acting is well executed, believable, and entertaining. It raised the bar for movies for ever. If you haven't seen this movie yet I'd say it is a ""must see movie"" in my books. Do not hesitate to give it a couple hours of your time, you will not be disappointed."	10
 great	Great movie I was in love with it from beginning to end. I would love to have part of the cast. Morgan freeman is spellbinding, and captivating. Steven King did a great job at putting this together. cant wait to see what else he has in store for us. I would love to see an expansion on the plot. where are they now, what has happen to them was it a happily ever after. The acting was superb, from all characters, reminded me of Micheal Clark Duncan and the green mile, once i started watching i could not take my eyes away. there should be more movies like this more love for the art of film, to really give what it takes to create a wonderful masterpiece such as this. I am hoping that something will be created soon that will be able to live up to the legend of this movie.	
 Not impressed.	"I'll go ahead and speak plainly about events from the movie, not caring too much about spoiling or not. If you haven't seen the movie and do not want the major plot twists told beforehand you should avoid this review.I must admit I was one of those guys who went on a hunt for this movie just because it is the highest rated movie on this website. It was second place on general public top 250 when I decided I had to see it. Not to mention most recent high-rated films I am familiar with to a point of remembering, or hearing about; this one wasn't the case.To tell the truth I watched the movie three times now and I still haven't seen anything resembling greatness to be the highest acclaimed film in the most important website about cinema in the planet.It's not bad, but I found overshadowed by the immense hype surrounding it. It's certainly 7/10 material in my book, but the idiotic fanboys along with the constant praise for it being superior film-making just slides it down a notch or two.The story about a guy that is innocently convicted and how his life develops inside the prison with a friend named Red and a few surprises here and there is well told. The so-called message it carries? Well, it seems people are all about that ""hope"" thing since he indeed is innocent of the crime he's in for, and how eventually he escapes prison leaving behind a hostile environment that never really believed in him, a warden that exploited his dry as much as he could, and of course beating the error of the system in his own game.He loses his whole life while at it though, but who cares, it's all about hope. It's hard to relate anything to real life since even the finale seems too wonderful to be true. The guy just goes to an obscure island and lives happily ever after. Even Red drops by when he's finally out on parole. Great deal.After 30 years digging a tunnel with a miniature pickaxe after being wrongly convicted for a crime he did not commit and stealing from the corrupt warden in the process sounds the absolute catharsis for some, I thought it was sad, sad that he lost his whole life in a prison, sad that he had to put up with all that crap for so long, sad that he must have been reintegrated after a while if somehow his story went on. Call me a pessimist, but that's not hope.I sometimes wonder what so many people saw in this movie that I was the only one on planet earth who did not quite ""get it"". The only thing this movie taught me more than anything else is that democracy is not always the best regime. What did every one suddenly see that back in 1994 people did not? Maybe it's an internet this right? Internet stuff, that serious business. This strange Leviathan that transforms unknown South-Korean pop singers in music sensations and record-holders for most watched movie on the planet. The internet, maybe someone watched it and thought it would be funny to invent a secret message, so deep, so unworldly, so incredible and anyone who could not ""see it"" was instantly deemed unworthy.That monster that drives everyone to think this average movie should be considered some kind of demigod due to its averageness. We see that because we're average, enlightened beings see greatness, colossal messages within that lifts the human spirit, cleanse our souls with its reach.The movie was good, and that's about it."	6
 Great, simple and attractive	The Shawshenk Redenption is best movie i ever seen in this category.You can watch great acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I think Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins makes they best in this film. Congragulations for the writer because it's a Great story. Maybe it's simple but very strong and attractive scenario.İn the scenario the surprises make the film better.. İ would like to thanks all the person who worked for this fantastic movie. The story takes you from the beginning and you are putting your self into the Tim Robbins.Simple and strong. I will watch again with my family. İt show you, there is no need only computer tricks for make good movies	10
 awesome	Best movie i have ever seen. its gonna blow your mind to bits. when i started watching, i took the movie lightly. but the movie kept getting interesting. the outstanding playback, and world class acting by everyone in the movie. every role in movie played a tremendous role. when i watched the movie, i could not believe what kind of movie i have just witnessed. seriously, watch it.now, i have great respect for director, and yes... morgan freeman, the man who is everywhere, legendary actor. he was in 105 movies, this one is one of the best.	9
 My review about Shawshank Redemption	"When I watched Shawshank Redemption at first,I had been in the high school and this film left a good impression with me, I say that I learned how to follow your passions and hopes, how to struggle to be free. And "" don't never forget,hope is good something and good somethings never die "" this sentence which passes in the film, I always believe it every part of mine. Because A person lives with his or her hopes and passions so, If it is seized from people,that people lose their aims in the life. And what the best properties of this film, It shows that hopes and passions are indispensable for people...In addition to my review about Shawshank Redemption, Whenever I watch this film, I learn that it puts in new things my life. It is so important for every watcher, Shawshank Redemption should be watched and I advise it to you :)"	8
 One of the best, ever		10
 An absolute masterpiece.	This movie absolutely tugs at every emotional string during it's powerful story line and triumph. This a must see and also a classic. Regardless of your personal preference and movie demographic, this movie will not disappoint. And of course Morgan Freeman in my opinion, is and always will be one of/is the greatest actor(s) of all time. I remember watching this as a child and even being moved but not necessarily understanding the basis of it. Now being older and watching it multiple times it never looses it's edge. And hopefully generations from now can enjoy it as I have. And I also own the VHS (Remember those? lol). And the Blu ray edition along with the DVD. Well enough rambling and I apologize, I just truly love this movie.	10
 Very Great And Awesome Movie.	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	9
 Best Example of Classic Movie Making	Shawshank Redemption is the one of the best classic movies ever made. The plot, the narration of Morgan freeman, the story, characterization, everything else in this movie makes you feel carried away to a another world. Once you done watching this movie you feel gifted as you are a free man, the happiness only a free man can feel.Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) who got sentenced for life makes friends in prison. Red (Morgan Freeman) the man who knows to get things becomes the best friend of Andy and thus the story continues about their stay in the prison for almost 20 years.This is the best movie i have ever seen in my life. The experience is just sooo satisfactory.....the happiness you feel at the ending is outstanding	10
 Masterpiece at Its Best	As mentioned In summary 'Masterpiece' is an apt word for this film . It is filled with Everything what the Viewers Needed . Dark And sensuality makes the film very realistic . All characters lived their roles and The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short.. Awesome movie Give it a Look and u will never feel wasted . Masterpiece at its best .There is not a dull moment or poor line of dialogue in this film. Credit first time director Frank Darabont for this remarkable piece of work. I still can't believe this was his first movie!, he will find it hard to top this masterful film. Special mention must be made of the music score by Thomas Newman, who has composed a simple, but perfect score for this film. His scoring of the scene with Andy and Red sitting up against the wall discussing their plans for release is nothing short of brilliant, as is the rest of his score.Give it a Watch for sure .	10
 A damn good film, worthy of great praise.		10
 For people who are planning to be a movie addict like me, this one is the best start	"The movie features friendship and the bond created between two strangers who have never met each other before. How they feel comfort in a place like Shawshank which I can say is a Hell in real life. Kudos to the directors and actors for such a lovely masterpiece and a must watch for all movie lovers. Even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. The movie will make you emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important and you will realize it once you have watched this one. A strong recommendation.MJ"	9
 Great movie	It's a great movie. recommended for watching. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them. With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.	10
 Pure friendship beyond the bars	An epic movie about how strong the relations between humans can be when the freedom is taken and is replaced by the dedication, hope and trust. When your universe has fallen you become undressed of the world's pervert feelings and your inside broken castle reborns. The main character of the movie gives us a lesson of how much the inside dreams must be followed by any means, even if the sorrow is against us. Places like the prison gives the real image of the value inside the people. The optimistic final in the movie is a message to all of us that if we follow our ideals passing through the harshest conditions we will realise that everything is possible and we will become better people.	9
 10	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	9
 The Shawshank Exception	An exceptional drama with one of the best on-screen duos in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Writer/Director Frank Darabont made on of the must-see movies for any film fanatic. Yes, the film might be bit overrated, but that doesn't mean that it's not worthy of the praise it has been getting over the years.The story is gripping and timeless and is good for multiple viewing. Cinematography is beautiful and the execution of the time frame is stung.The film is not without its flaws but they are so minor that they are over shadowed by how the film carries itself. Whether you like the movie or not is always subjective, but one thing is for sure The Shawshank Redemption will leave an impression on you.	10
 A masterpiece with an inspirational message	This is the best movie I've ever watched!! It told a moving story very effectively. Former banker Andy Dusfresne is wrongly convicted for a double murder and sent to Shawshank Prison. The first few years are a struggle but he eventually carves out for a place for himself and benefits the other inmates in the process, winning favours through helping the guards and warden with financial planning and expanding the prison's meagre library. He becomes solid friends with Red, a black man who entered 20 years before and is highly resourceful. What resonates with the audience is Andy's clinging to hope. The saddest part was when the boy that Andy had been tutoring obtained a high school diploma, but shortly after, was shot dead under the warden's orders as he had knowledge that could prove Andy innocent. Following that, Red tells Andy that hope is a dangerous thing. Bur further events prove that hope is in fact a good thing (as Andy tells Red in a letter) - Andy escapes through a hole he dug in his cell wall (hidden behind a large poster of a hot woman) and escapes to Mexico using a false identity and cash that he'd procured while laundering money for the warden. Before leaving, he submits evidence incriminating the hypocritical warden. As the cross-stitching on the warden's office wall reads, judgment does indeed come! Red is released soon after and struggles to adapt to the outside the world. But for Andy's invitation to join him, Red would probably have gone down the path of Brooks, who committed suicide.The Shawshank Redemption combined a message of hope with wonderful storytelling and attention to detail. It's truly a masterpiece.	10
 What a great movie.	It has been a pretty long time since i have seen such a great movie , great actors and great play of roles. Watching this movie made me realize a little evolution on movies spirit,knowing that lately film companies are trying to put technology first. In general , the movie managed to build a very strong emotional link between characters in the film , and apparently , that link is strong enough to make us feel for them and share feelings with the cast.I simply love everything about this movie, beginning from Andy's first day in prison , to his last day locked.I was impressed with the details ,they were perfectly handled,(per say) like the time when Andy tried to hit the pipes on the same time with the storm so the guards would not hear him trying to escape. Those little things matter a lot. I gave it a 10 and enjoyed watching it. Simply beautiful.	9
 good	this was a very good movie very very excellent it was fantastic, i watched it in school for government class. i would watch this a million times this is so very good I wish there were a part two of the movie I would pay to see part two this was a super good movie there should be a part 3 and a part 4 this was a very good movie and excellent quality. I wish i were able to be in the movie. i would of done very good in this movie. there should be a remake I like the part where he broke out of jail he fell in some nasty stuff but overall it was a very good movie if i were in the movie I don't know what part i would do but i would try to do as good as the other cast members	10
 Never forget this movie in my life...	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. What a story and screenplay. It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Written and directed by Frank Darabont. I'll Never forget this movie in my life. The opening aerial shots of the prison are a total eye-opener. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story.	10
 This film is amazing. Just amazing.		10
 Can A Movie Be Perfect?	I saw this film when I was fourteen, and at the time it was the most flawlessly impressive piece of storytelling I had ever seen. If I were forced to make a top 10 list this movie would certainly be right up there. Robbins and Freeman are both incredible, and as good as they are in other films I would still say it remains their finest work. The scenery and costumes, the prison which if I remember right was an actual prison back around the same time the film took place. It is all so rich with texture and detail that it draws you in. The story is great, Stephen King has written some amazing stories and this is a testament that he is not just a horror novel expert. The actors all take it to the next level and make it a pretty much perfect film. It is pretentious to say a film or any piece of art is perfect, however I honestly can't say there is anything I dislike about the film. No scene seems long and unnecessary, every actor is perfectly cast and feels very authentic. It really is the real deal. Like American History X and some other films it is a movie that everyone with a moderately high IQ and a love of cinema should see one day.	10
 Long but fast paced	A good fast paced movie. Not your typical prison movie. Tim Robbins has a cool demeanor and Morgan Freeman does a great job in his supporting role as well as narrating the film. Kudos also to the warden and his sadistic enforcer. This movie has a lot more character development and depth than your typical prison movie. It can be slightly depressing at times but what drama isn't? I'm not even the drama type and even I liked this movie. This movie does a great job of evoking feelings of fear, anger, excitement, sadness, hope and inspiration. This film isn't for the faint of heart. The music score contributes greatly to the film. A must- see for drama lovers.	8
 Great Wholesome movie	"This is probably my favorite movie of all time. It lacks intense graphics and sex appeal, and more modern day traits that interest me. However, when someone asks me what my favorite movie is; I always have to say Shawshank redemption. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor that has proved to be able to grow through the years. The plot is one that appeals to nearly every person on the face of the earth. It's an extreme underdog story, a simple man gets his revenge movie, and it's wholesome. Nothing more could be asked of this story. Everyone has had nightmares of being ""locked up"" for something they didn't do, and this also appeals to that emotion."	10
 Simply the greatest film ever made	"I will never forget how I was introduced to this film. My very abstract thinking gypsy of a cousin was visiting our home and as we began talking about films made mention of this one. She followed with the traditional line of, ""What!?! You have not seen that movie? Oh my God, it's the GREATEST!"". With reluctance(really....to be honest we just did not want to be rude!), we all agreed to watch. What transpired over the next 2+ hours was the greatest movie I have ever seen. This movie covers every spectrum of the human existence possible. Death, life, heartache, love, friendship, betrayal, injustice and of course justice just to name a few. The entire movie is a roller coaster of the human condition and the end will leave you bathing in tears and triumph. I have seen so many movies both old and new in my life but this one is just above them all. The last 20 minutes alone are worth the price of admission.....A must watch for everyone."	10

Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation.In 1947, banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, based on circumstantial evidence, and is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy quickly befriends contraband smuggler Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston). In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library. In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving kickbacks. He has Andy launder the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In 1965, Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) is incarcerated for burglary. He joins Andy's and Red's circle of friends, and Andy helps him pass his General Educational Development (G.E.D.) examinations. In 1966, after hearing the details of Andy's case, Tommy reveals that an inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package. The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. The police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest. After serving 40 years, Red receives parole. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole and travels to Fort Hancock, Texas to cross the border to Mexico, admitting he finally feels hope. On a beach in Zihuatanejo, he finds Andy, and the two friends are happily reunited."	10
 Magnificent	Of course this outstanding movie doesn't need my opinion, But Utterly I felt obligated to review, so let's do this thing : -The story is amazing, The sequence of the events, The surprise at the ending, I loved it. -One of the greatest perks in movies is the moral of it, which -in this case- hope, I find it mentally rewarding,Of course with The subliminal messages of -keep trying- or -never give it a rest- . -The characters are great, Specially Morgan's role (I'm just a big fan) -Soundtrack is pretty good, Not excellent (I prefer Quentin Tarantino's Taste of music, So I'm not criticizing the soundtrack because it's fairly not my type) -And finally the best thing IMO about this movie was its simplicity in everything, yet It delivers . thanks for taking time reading my opinion :)	10
 i like this movie	great movie. i enjoyed when they broke princess leia out of her cell and used the hole behind the poster to slide down the tunnel and away from that huge boulder that was chasing them. king of the north! this is a prison i would grow a tree at with seeds from a viper. where did larry get those glasses with x ray vision. my vote is for the girl who was born a boy. i'm not saying that sugar is in my blood but i can lift a car over my head have you seen my clean and hairless feet my ears look like a rusty clam after someone yells bingo 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 7 7 10 9 is all you ever need 6 to 4 is not about any particular trend of shoes perry knocked over table!	10
 I really Enjoyed this movie! When Life gets you down, this movie shows you can get through anything with your mind made up to do so.		10
 Unequ Movie	"when i saw top movie ranking i found this one but my point of view is this this movie is good but also made a hope for jail broken theme ..this is also not a good over all good example for best hope .... :). OVERALL SCORE: 9.8/10 = A+ The Shawshank Redemption served as a message of hope to Hollywood as well. More than any film in memory, it proved there is life after box office. Besting Forrest and Fiction, it ran solely on strong word of mouth and became the hottest rented film of 1995. It currently sits at #2 in the IMDb's Top 250 Films, occasionally swapping spots with The Godfather as the top ranked film of all time -- redemption indeed. If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell are you waiting for? As Andy says, ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying."""	8
 Remember...Hope is a Good Thing...I Admit.	"I Don't know how many times i have watched this movie and i know i will definitely watch it again,but this movie always inspire me whenever i lost my hope and got imprisoned by fear of failure and wrongdoings,it helps to conquer this premise.i often thrown in to oblivion,whenever i have no idea about what to do, the one quote made me busy with my life is ""Get busy living or Get busy dying"". In fact,quotes from the movie stick to my desktop which could not be removed even by myself.Furthermore,the climax of the movie made me shocked as well as concluded the bottom line ""Hope is a Good Thing"" which i still follow and forever."	10
 A Timeless Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. When I was younger I would always see this movie playing on various channels and always wondered why. What made this movie so special? Well, the answer is pretty much everything in this movie is special, from the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose characters are really fleshed out in subtle ways to the overall themes that have made the movie so watchable ever since it was first released. There is a reason this movie is still being played on channels to this day! If you have not seen this movie, than go watch it immediately! You wont regret it.	10
" Great adaptation of ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"""		10
 The rating shows everything: must watch!		10
 a touching and entertaining movie	this is by far one of my favorite movies! Not only just because of morgan Freeman sexy voice, but because of the flawless acting and connection to the characters in the movie! If you're looking for a movie with a great story line, then i will very much recommend this movie. the pros of this movie is that it has well known and great actors in it, a great storyline stretching over several dozen years.the cons can be that it is long, but for many people (like me) then that can be a very good thing! i just thought i might as well add something to the cons, so the movie seems more human, because this is a movie where there's just nothing that you would wish to change. another con would be that there's not too much action going on in it witch there is a few people who likes.	10

 Great movie	"One Of the best movies I have seen The script was well written. The characters played there parts well & were well suited for there picked rolls.

 About how to inmates turn about to be best friends and how unexpected life can be.	An excellent Movie One of the best I've ever watched about two men who seek redemption from the institutionalization of the prison. They seek freedom yet like the place..It is about friendship,happiness,tears,.The Movie is about a banker on how he is sent to prison for his wife's murder and makes friends there He turns out to be very popular among the inmates. The film brilliantly narrates the life of prisoners who spend their lives decently. As it turns out that he is innocent He finally Plans and breaks out of the prison.The movie is beautifully written, directed,and the cherry on the top is Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.... The dialogue delivery..the expression .. the acting holds you during the entire movie...A must watch movie...	10
 Great film		8
 Quite simply, a film that should never be forgotten	'Get busy livin' or get busy dyin', that's damn right'.A stand-out performance from the magnificent movie maestro Morgan Freeman, whom leads this spectacular motion picture with fantastic style as the enigmatic convict known as Red, earning himself a well deserved Academy Award nomination. Tim Robbins plays our main protagonist, Andy Dufresne, an innocent banker charged with the murder of his wife, a crime he did not commit. The film chronicles Dufresne's time in Shawshank Penetentiary, from the first day meeting the 'more-than welcome' guards, to dirty deals with corrupt Warden Sharp (played by a superb Bob Gunton), to befriending characters like Red and Brooks, a 70-something long-sentence server acting as librarian (played by James Whitmore, in one of his later roles) and to the momentous break-out, symbolising everything this film stands for: hope. Shawshank is the perfect movie, great story, great actors and a great director. The culmination of captivating music and scintillating atmosphere transform this movie into something more: a legend. I would thoroughly recommend this film to anyone, it is a must watch.	10
 One of the Greatest movies that i have seen in my Life till date.	"The movie starts bit slow, but right from the start you will feel that you are into it. Every moment your mind will be wondering what will happen next cos you never know. The director has made great effort to make it like that. There are very few good movies that defines ""Hope"". But non can challenge this one. The movie shows how good can happen even in the worst, and to never loss hope. Morgan Freeman is another master piece in this movie. Both his acting and narration touches our heart. There are some extreme scenes in the movie that shows the reality to what happens in a Prison. How people tend to behave during the initial period and how they transform it to a routine that is to be followed every single day. I am really great full that i saw this movie and found a crucial part to believe in. If you are looking for a good classical movie that has drama, suspense and a message than this will be the best movies you will ever watch. If you are looking for a action movie and hungry for blood then this is not for you."	10
 Review	Paragraphically, at First, when I see the film, some Centinal stuffs wasn't pull out. Due to many problems and unresolved conflicts, I see it as a dump. But when I see it the second time, I understand what it is about, and how it came to be the greatest drama of all time. It benefits from a strong cast, feeling that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did the film themselves. They devoted to the film all they got. From expression, to heavy feelings. They look us in the eye, and expresses their demand for freedom and a life of a normal man. The film drives us from jail to out, resulting some hard to be fitted in like Brooks. It's an unique way, seeing the prisoners dealing with their life afterward, not like any other films. It has a great script, a set scene full of masterpiece coming to life after 20 years of finding it's own success. It stepped out, starting as a bomb, but ended as a real life and day with surviving and breakthrough hearted mean with the Shawshank Prison	10
 The discussion on Shawshank Redemption		10
 Best movie ever!	I really can say that this movie is one of the best movies I have ever watched in my life. Plus the heroes play a great & wonderful role which makes you be a part of them & like you are in that prison with them! Hail Tim Robbins! Hail Morgan Freeman!At the end Andy got his freedom as that is the justice! yet that devil who were responsible for the prison is just a real corrupted person which show us that you can find the innocent people inside jail & those who are guilty is enjoying the life on account of others! This movie is really sending us such a lesson which is you have to keep the faith up, even if you feel or see all situations against you! You have to stuck on your principles.	10
 Amazing movie	I absolutely loved this movie. It's very heart warming and is full of emotion. I loved it so much i even went to one of the prisons that the movie took place in. Mansfield Ohio Reformatory. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Morgan Freeman and puzzle solving films. It is also and inspirational film to look up on because of the story line and all the different angles and what not. If you ever want to go to the prison in Mansfield.. The scene where Mr. Brooks hangs himself in his apt and carves his name was also shot in that very prison. I also must say that this film brought me into tears of sadness and joy. The director was really good at capturing the emotions for the viewers.	10
 A movie about Hope and Justice		10
 best movie ever		10
 What a nice movie!	This movie is one of my favorites.First of all, scenes are so real in the mean time are dramatic enough. I especially liked the final scene and quotes about hope as movie lasts. While watching, I did not expect that the film will have happy ending so that one can think that escaping such kind of prison can never be possible. However in the end, this process became successful in a way that we can never imagine. From my point of view, with this point, aim of movie is to show that in every hard situation it is possible to succeed with just not losing hope and be optimistic about our dreams which does not let us to give up, conversely to draw conclusions even we can never imagine. This movie had really huge impact on this side.	8
 Classic	"One of my all time favourite movies. The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a banker who spends nearly two decades in Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding, and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. Definitely worth the watch, if you haven't seen it. You are missing out. It is well written, scripted and well acted by Freeman and Robbins. This classic will be one that can be watched over and over. Frank Darabont made this the classic it is."	10
 Leaves an Impact for a long time	"""Hope is a good thing and no good thing ever dies"". This one line of the film says it all, this movie is all about hope, and things which you can relate to in your life. I became a huge fan of Freeman after watching this movie. Movie is bit slow in starting but builds up pace quickly. You start flowing with Andy and have a connect with him as the movie progresses. The story goes like this- Andy is send for life time imprisonment for allegedly killing his wife and her boyfriend,in jail first few years were really bad but slowly he starts to find friend and also some work. If I tell more than the whole suspense will come out. The emotions carried out in each seen by red and Andy has been superb. Its a must watch!!"	10
 One of the greatest movie ever...	I loved the Screenplay of this movie. How he narrate the story from start to end. I watched this movie in my mother tang TAMIL. That was awesome, That helped lot to understand each and every line of the story. Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.The bottom line is that The Shawshank Redmption is a perfect movie. It takes you in from the opening scene and doesn't let you go until long after it comes to a tremendous close.like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long.Very rarely are you left with a large smile and warm heart at the end of a movie but, I could have danced as the camera slowly panned back from the beach	10
 I agree 100%	This is for sure my favourite pre-2000 movie. Its prison, its life, it has everything a guy could ask for and I didn't even name half of the stuff in this movie! You have Andy coming in for a crime he didn't even commit, Tommy who got caught robbing some place, you even got Brooks who kills himself because he couldn't handle being out of prison. I haven't seen the movie in a while, but I can see myself watching it tonight. My favourite part would have to be the ending when Red and Andy meet in Mexico after Andy escapes, which I might add was really cool too. How he dug a tunnel out and lead the guards off, that would take major skill if Hollywood magic didn't exist. Well, anyway, watch it. You will love it.	10
 Incredible.	The beginning of the film is remarkable, but when Andy finally gets out of solitary confinement and is sitting against the wall next to Red, you can feel the stress and the intensity of the movie. There is no other movie that I have ever seen where a silent intensity has ever been done so well. You as a member of the audience know that something is going on, and the storytelling by Morgan Freeman seals the deal. The acting in this film is remarkable, and the subplots and the heartfelt ending of the film truly make this film worthy of the number one spot on t list. The writers and casters of the film could not have selected a better actor for Andy's part than Tim Robbins, with his logical, calm, and reserved personality that reflected so well onto the film. Finally, the realization of the other inmates that Andy is in fact innocent is absolutely chilling, and has you rooting for the character all along. This film is number one on the top 250 for a reason.	10
 Get busy Watchin	Life in ShawShank Prison coalesces criminality, corruption, death, truth, god and hope into a wonderful film starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Set in the 1940's, Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker whose life is altered forever when he is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. Shawshank demonstrates how quickly and naively the criminal justice system can wrongly convict a man and alter his destiny forever. Lady justice clearly is incapable of knowing all things and rendering perfect judgment.An innocent man at heart, Andy, with the help of his friend Red, showcase the life of prisoners and put on full display internal prison dynamics, the effects of lengthy prison sentences on the soul, the process of rehabilitation, and the will to survive with hope to live and fight another day. Following his conviction, Andy is tortured by a small immoral gang of rapists until the warden places him in his protective womb. In exchange for his services and help with financial matters Andy's stature grows and his influence spreads. A friendly relationship develops over the years, with Andy eventually processing tax returns, and subsequently running a fraudulent scheme for the warden. Surprise twists find its way in the form of a truth telling inmate overhearing the real killer of Andy's wife. Warden Norton wants no part in this, fearing for his operations and control of the institution. Quickly he pours ice on the idea, and subjugates Andy to physical torment to bend his will.Ever the precocious young lad, Andy secretly plots for over 20 years and reveals an astounding and ingenious strike to send Warden Norton into a suicidal finale.Shawshank is a classic, darker than The Green Mile, yet truthfully a reflection of how the system can go so very wrong. Sometimes, truth and justice are not good enough, and one must rely on himself to adequately realign the scales.	9
 One of the best movies ever made.	This is without a doubt one of the best movies I have ever watched. It has everything you can ever ask from a movie without being cheesy or over the top on any score.I love the way the story is told by the main character himself. You can really see the life of a prisoner in there and the struggle they all go through. They somehow manage to find things to make them enjoy the time and eventually get used to the idea of staying inside the prison. They all learn to become friends but still finds enemies, like the warden and some of the guards. They are portrayed as the good guys even though they are prisoners who has committed crimes. You really bond to them through the screen and can look through their eyes. The ending of this movie, the first time I saw it, was so unexpected! The way he had spent so many years to carve a hole in the wall and then escape. And then the very last scene when they meet each other again on the beach! 10 out of 10!	10
 Greatest Movie Of All Time	The first time I heard about The Shawshank Redemption was during the Oscars. They showed probably the worst scene they could (when Andy is playing the opera music to the prison.) Unfortunately, I never got to see Shawshank in the theaters. I saw it on VHS and instantly fell in love with the movie. The story made me want it to go on forever. I rented the movie five times before finally buying it on VHS. I cannot recommend this movie any higher. Since I saw it the first time in 1995, no movie has approached it. Frank Darabont directed a brilliant movie and made me a fan of his movies. For a story about two men in prison, it definitely surprised me. The story will keep you hoping to find the truth and sticking around to find out how it all will end. Hope you enjoy the show!	10
 A film way ahead of it's time...	"This film is on my list of all time favorites. It has an awesome message. This film has so much depth and growth that its like a great page turner that you don't want to put down.Director Frank Darabont was out did himself in this film. He gave the viewer just the right amount of every aspect of drama, excitement and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat wanting more. He gave such a detailed depiction of prison life in a way that has never been seen on screen but yet gave us a sense of compassion for prisoners as well.Tim Robbins gave a very phenomenal performance from start to finish. He was the guy you just always wanted to route for. His performance was great throughout the film . Robbins played Andy Dufresne who was convicted of a crime and is sentenced to prison. He has to learn to adapt to a whole new life. He be-friends an African American man named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Red is feels as if he has no hope of ever being anything more than an inmate and is content with that. Red feels that the only way to survive is to become still to the world and try not to become institutionalized. Throughout the years Red watches his friend Andy go through a lot of things and change. Along with their good friend Brooks Halten played by James Whitmore who gave an awesome performance as well. The three experience prison life together but in different ways. Over all the cinematography, the directing and the performances were EXCELLENT! If you've never seen this film it is a definite must see. You will love it and I bet it will be on your list of all time favorites as well. I give this film a excellent rating because it has all the makings of a great film and delivers just that. It was a GREAT FILM all around!"	10
 Hope		10
 What did Shawshank Redeem?	As English is not my native tongue, it is a bit hard to grasp what does 'Redemption' means in Shawshank's Redemption. In my understanding, a prisoned is helpless, who can he save?It is even more confusing that Shawshank is an innocent guy. Surely the word 'revenge' will be more appropriate to replace 'redemption' in this context. As the film unfold, it becomes clear to me that Shawshank redeemed himself and others as he wasn't hateful. He calmly accept the unfairness in his life and dealt it with dignity and resilience. Some time, we are caged in a prison that's created by ourself. We often cry out 'it is unfair!' or 'It is not just!' But how often do we actually take any actions against them? Do we have the confidence that one day the prison wall will eventually get through by a small tool? Can we calmly deal with the pressure and threat that consume us mentally and physically? Are we ready to craw through a gutter that's full of sh*t to reclaim our entitled freedom?When we in despair, it is encouraging to reflect on this fictional guy - Shawshank. Life some time is not about revenging, it is about redeeming. It is easier to revenge, but cooler to redeem.	10
 One of the best of its time		9
 Great Actors before I was born		9
 best film I ever seen		9
 A classic and childhood favorite	Simply put, it's one of the best movies out there and the fact that it is number one on IMDb's top 250 is a testament to that. I love how you can witness the characters undergo a complete 180 transformation and it's almost as if you and the audience make that transformation with them. It's a timeless movie that someone can watch 10 years from now and have just as enjoyable an experience as the first viewing. If you have not seen this movie yet: YOU ARE MISSING OUT. With high highs, low lows and plenty of clever humor this is a movie that I would Highly recommended to ANYONE! GO see this movie now. You won't regret it. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie is not human.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption, a magnificent work	The Shawshank Redemption is a magnificent work, in which the drama takes place in a calm, striking and surprising. Frank Darabont is the ideal person to adapt the works of Stephen King, manages to tell this heartwarming and inspirational story, conveying the hope of freedom and happiness together for the spectator. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, two superb actors, who once again showed their worth with this excellent performance. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is magnificent. The end of the film, the way it is prepared, will surprise anyone who assists and dazzle with boldness and simplicity of this magnificent drama.	9
 There are few problems	There are few problems, and none of them are terribly distracting at all. There is a slight shimmering in a scene or two and some very small instances of grain. Other than that, this is an excellent looking image that will certainly beautiful sound mix. It's also a newly remastered 5.1 mix. It's not flashy or showy, nor does it need to be. It does however, do what it needs to do best very well. The score by Thomas Newman is absolutely wonderful and it sounds clear and crisp throughout the picture. Surrounds are put into use occasionally, but always in a subtle way that is right for the picture. What I was pleased about most though, was how rich and clean the score sounded on this DVD. Dialogue is clear and without problems as well. Again, Non-animated main menus that have the score playing in the disappointment of this DVD	
 A movie that worth a must watch		10
 Fantastic, brilliant and memorable.		10
 A worthy mention to film enthusiast,excellent direction,mind blowing performance,mixed up with outstanding cast		9
 What else is there to say?	This movie has remained number 1 on the IMDb Top 250 for several years now with no sign of slipping. It has beaten the ranks of The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly and countless others. I myself have watched this film countless times now yet every time I thoroughly enjoy it. I have recommend it to many friends and family and have to this day not had a dissatisfied customer. The Script, Cast, Direction, Mood, and Execution of this movie are flawless. For anyone who has bothers to sit and watch this do yourself and favor and find the time. I am a huge Stephen King fan and for the master of horror this is easily the best screen adaptation of his work to date and it is not even of the horror genre. See this movie again and again.	10
 After being accused of murdering his wife, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), is sentenced to life imprisonment and sent to Shawshank Prison.	This film is excellent in all respects, in fact, this is one of the few films close to perfection starting from the actors, (The combination of Morgan Freeman (totally love him as an omniscient narrator who keeps us informed about the who's who) and Tim Robbins really give life to every scene visualized cleverly, the great script, based on the novel by Stephen King (the best novel of it, without doubt), the awesome soundtrack, excellent editing, everything fits perfectly. It has definitely the best narrative that leads to entertain and intrigue many times. What is so awesome about the story? It combines drama, comedy and thriller. The script is great, because it relates the stories of various characters during the whole film to reach a surprising ending, thus captivating the audience at all times. Anyway, Shawshank Redemption has it all. This film is one of those whose ending I failed to predict. The ending twist is really genius.	8
 very good film		10
 Spectacular	The Shawshank Redemption is a film worth watching. Well-written, well directed and well shot, this film is entertaining throughout. It's a real tear-jerker with deep meaning, and is a must-watch for anyone remotely interested in movies. The only negative is that the story's a little far-fetched, but it barely affects enjoyment of this film.The plot summary might make The Shawshank Redemption sound a little boring to the modern-day film fanatic, but it really isn't. It's filled with dramatic tension and is both depressing and uplifting, which is a quite rare characteristic for a film to have. This movie is not to be missed.	8
 First review	One of the best movies I have ever seen.Every scene of the movie was a masterpiece!The role of a prisoner matched perfectly with Morgan Freeman and hearing his voice through the movie made it the best movie to see in years.The last scene was my favorite and the most feeling one!Another scene that I liked was the moment that Morgan Freeman (Red) went under the tree next to the stones and found the little box with the money and the card-postal.I recommend you to watch this movie , it will be one of your favorites.I have watched a variety of movies but I can easily take this out of the many and tell you that the actors and the producer made a wonderful job and made one of the best movies ever.	10
 Transcendent, sad and beautiful	"I love this movie. No matter how bad my life may be going, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes me feel better about everything. The idea that a man can remain unbroken against every possible setback, injustice, brutality, and loss of freedom is an excellent painting of the indomitability of the human spirit. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give unforgettable, multi-faceted performances in these career-defining roles. Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown turn in chilling depictions of callous, sociopathic sadists in the guise of authority. The entire supporting cast is perfectly chosen and completely believable.Stephen King wrote this story at the end of his second period and in the beginning of his third phase of truly literary writing, and it shows. Frank Darabont is an amazing director, partnered with some truly incredible cinematography by Roger Deakins and a haunting, memorable score by Thomas Newman. 10/10."

 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 GREAT American Story	THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST OF ITS KIND that I remember. This movie had me thinking and trying to figure it out through most of the movie. Its surprising, humorous, sad, dis/encouraging, and all worth the wait. If you like a MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD MOVIE thats down to earth, then Definitely watch The Shawshank Redemption. It takes you through all emotions possible without being too harsh. This movie is great Alone and with Others EQUALLY. If you feel down, discouraged, or bored, then put this on IMMEDIATELY. The Shawshank Redemption is witty, unpredictable, informative, inspirational, Shocking but also A true depiction of past circumstances for the most part.	10
 Excellent in every aspect	I wondered why everyone like this movie, whats so best about this movie? i watched it for more than a dozen of times and still i don't know whats so best about this movie. every time i watch this master piece, i wait patiently like lead actor in this movie with same excitement, thrill and eager to know whats going on at the end of movie ,same result of course but with the increased love and passion towards this movie. characters are all criminals but they (specially Tim Robbins and Morgan freeman ) are my idol already and for so many years to come. they teach you to learn , to be patient , and to hit while time is there. this is one of the most inspiring movie i ever watched........	10
 Story Telling at its best	Now writing a review to read for around 1 million viewers who have already watched the movie may sound foolish. But since I am on a big mood swing of excitement, I am writing it. Some movies never get old. Some reasons are no use of technology, never fading human feelings, universally accepted ground concepts, etc. So, maybe because of these reasons, The Shawshank Redemption seems to have found its way to the Top Alltime 250 Movies in this website. Overall, the movie made my day. In fact it made my whole year. The main actor of the movie is no less than any super hero. Also you ought to believe that these kind of people, these kind of incidents do happen in the real world. Although may not with these kind of drama. But, you can say, they do. I really regret that this movie did not earn much during its initial time of release. A Straight sweep Full 10.	10
 saa	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	
 Movie is Excellent		10
 Andy, Red and The Shawshank Redemption	The Shawshank Redemption was originally released in 1994 and at the time it didn't receive its worthy praise, its due credit for being without any doubt one of the finest movies ever made, a gargantuan picture. It felt considered to be truly great, yet nothing quite remarkable, why is that? Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction are majorly responsible. Also though when you're watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time you might take notice of how fanciful it is, seemingly sugarcoated, and may tend to initially and foolishly discount it as being a soft misrepresentation of life in Shawshank, but as the movie perseveres through gruesome occurrences and never shows a single imperfection, never seizes to amaze, it gradually becomes clear that this is a powerhouse of a movie, an undisputed masterpiece, and it's not a distorted viewpoint, it's just lighthearted and viewer-friendly, and you may be required to reassess your feelings towards the film to be valued as one of the very best movies of all-time. The Shawshank Redemption is remarkable. It's one of the very few films that succeeds and even excels at depicting life on the brighter side while still maintaining enough darkly despair in proper prism. Prison isn't a fairy tale world. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't downgrade itself with a too grimy depiction; it's shown in a more pleasant way, in a more powerful way, and it's better this way, with no overstated unsavory trauma. The Shawshank Redemption is loaded with unsavory trauma, it just doesn't dwell on it. It ditches a grim outlook and upholds a faithful perspective. The Shawshank Redemption inspires great hope, even when your spirit has fallen into the darkest of places. Andy Dufresne is one of the best characters from film, period. Andy's unassuming, soft-spoken and distant nature makes him a prime target to befall victim to the hideous injustice of an ill-fated murder charge, but Andy is a brave soul, and he will seek redemption, even though Andy's very own soul is in most need of it. Andy's unfulfilled life has found new meaning in the most unlikely place, Shawshank. The story is among the best ever told. I venture to say that the narration provided by Red is the best, the very best of any movie. The narration doesn't compel you with startling plot developments, rather it guides you with reflection and comforts you throughout the indelicacies of the film. The narration is the driving force and the lasting impression of the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is mega engrossing; you do not quite know where it's heading, but you do not care because it is so good, and where it does eventually land is sheer brilliance, true movie magic. The end is simply genius, a clear metaphor for passing through hardship. I love that Red makes it to the good life too with Andy; this movie would have lost all of its might if not for its beautiful, happy ending. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those rare dramatic masterpieces as it's right up there on the short list of being the greatest movie of all-time. Give it its due. (Hummmmmmmmmmm...the #1 movie on the IMDb Top 250...that'll do.)	10
 I love The Shawshank Redemption. It's Awesome. Brooks was here. So was Andy and Red. I guess I just miss my friends.	"It's a masterpiece film that will have a value all the times. Some critics think after years of adulation and promotions from fans, that Shawshank Redemption has gotten overrated. In my opinion, I think they are wrong. Never have I been so moved by film. Its intriguing without being vague, intellectual without being conceited, long without ever losing pace but most of all what all art should be inspiring. I left feeling emotionally enlightened, enriched and equally drained. Breathtaking. The score was composed by Thomas Newman was stunning. The main theme (""End Titles"" on the soundtrack album) is perhaps best known to modern audiences as the inspirational sounding music from many movie trailers dealing with inspirational, dramatic, or romantic films. Shawshank Redemption is like wine I guess, the older it becomes the better it becomes, really bizarre how it didn't appeal much at the time 1994, it was pretty hard to beat Forrest Gump, and Pulp Fiction that year. It end up having a cult following, after years and years of being aired on cable television to the point. A lot amount of people have finally view it, and most of the time share the same opinion, it was great. You have two hours to dig into the story - and I can tell you it was worth it. Adapted from the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, the film directed by Frank Darabont tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is sent to Shawshank State Prison for the murder of his wife and her lover despite his claims of innocence. During his time at the prison, he befriends a fellow inmate, Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), and finds himself protected by the guards after the warden begins using him in his money laundering operation. It wasn't until he meets Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) does he heard that another inmate at another prison claimed responsibility for an identical murder, suggesting Andy's innocence. It was here that Andy makes a choice, continue to live with the sins in prison, or clean himself up by escaping it. The film wasn't about a grand scheme of plot. It was unusual in the sense that it didn't matter what happens, but only that the message is fulfilled: Fear can set you prisoner, hope can set you free. And it did fulfill it. Brilliantly. It is the script and the actors that make this movie so great. Morgan Freeman as Red is the highlight of the film. Before Freeman was cast, Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford were each considered for the role. Although the part was described as written as a middle-aged Irishman with graying red hair, Darabont cast Freeman for his authoritative presence and demeanor. Morgan Freeman is an amazing actor and his narrationing voice is so soothing. While I do like the narrations. Narration in films are always a sign of weakness in the story and plot. It is always used to cover up holes in the story; unless it conveys the protagonist's inner feelings and thought. Here, it conveys Red who is basically telling us what we are witnessing on the screen. While, I do like it, it wasn't really needed. The acting of Tim Robbins was great as well. I love the scene where he play a recording of Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro on the loudspeaker. Still, in some scenes, he's too wooden and stiff. Furthermore, he mumbles too much. Both, Tom Hanks and Kevin Costner turn down the role, two actors I do like. I also love Bob Gunton as the Warden, but I really wanted James Crowell as the Warden. I thought it would be amazing to have him in this film. There are some many themes and messages, it's hard to count. The biggest one is the fundamental pillars of human life: hope. Some critics do have a problem with the film in some areas like attempts to persuade the viewer to side with rapists, thieves, and murderers. It didn't help that 2007, two inmates of Union County Prison escaped from their prison using similar techniques to those featured in the movie. I think the biggest fault, is that white collar crime pays if you are slick. While Andy was innocent of the murders, he wasn't innocent in white collar crimes. Another thing that some critics nitpick is the deep emotional relationship between two men. I don't see anything wrong with it, thinking it as two men being friends. Some people say it's a homosexual relationship since in prison, homosexuality is normalized. This is clear throughout the film, not only through the characters of the sisters gang, but how inmates' referral to new arrivals as ""fresh fish."" There was also a lot of homosexual symbolism like the Rita Hayworth poster covering up something and how the sewer scene was a symbol for anal sex. If that's isn't weird enough, some critics have spotted many allegorical themes in the film, generally along the lines that Andy Dufresne is a latter day Jesus Christ. No matter what people see in it; even with some prison film clichés, it still a great film. I do like the 1963's 'Great Escape"" references with the socks. I don't want to spoil anything, but all I can say is, ""I'm glad I took the time to watch this movie"". Overall you build an understanding and feel for the characters, was real sad when certain characters died, really gets to you. The whole concept was smart, it just shocks how it was all put together and it works so well. Brilliant movie. Recommend anyone to watch it at least once in their life time. Don't take my word for it. Just watch it. So Get busy living or Get busy dying."	9
 wonderful movie	One of my all time favorite movies that I could watch over and over. I loved the role of Tim Robbins character and of Morgan Freeman as well. I have not seen the movie in years and I think it is just about time to watch it and relive all the greatness of the movie from what I remembered from the first time. It was amazing to see a movie that was written and acted out so well. Also sad to see someone spend so much time in prison as there 2 characters had. There are so many great movies that Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman each were in and this by far has to be there best work of all. This is definitely a must see movie. So if you have not seen this movie add this to your watchlist of all time great movies that you must see.	10

 good	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 This is a must watch movie, no doubt Morgan is good in acting.		9
 What a fabulous movie!	An amazing movie, a real must see! Incredible storyline and outstanding acting! Testament to the human spirit and what else? A story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the sky is blue. One of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top prison movies of all-time. A simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention the magnificent scenery. There is a lot of life and humor in it. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. The ratings of close to 1 million users prove it!	10

 The Classic Loner Andy Dufresne	A social misfit by nature,Andy on the outside of Shawshank prison was kind of a classic loner.But with Red,he fit right in at Shawshank.Breaks rules with few of his good friends.Never hurt nobody and quite in fact help everybody in the prison including the corrupt warden.His love for music is just majestic.And so there was,Andy Dufresne ended up in Shawshank Prison for a crime he did not commit and the Warden wants to keep him there for life.Inside those walls,people changes and it's funny as Red describes.At first,just after you got in,you want to be outside.But as you move on,they were growing on them.Brooks,who spent more than 50 years inside those walls,when he got out,he saw the world changed from when he got inside.So many changes that he felt leaving this world would be easier than to live in a world you don't understand.But hope is a very good thing.	9
 An Exhausting Drama, and the Best Ending EVER.	The #1 rating on IMDb.com's top 250 is no mistake. It was one of those movies where you feel exhausted at the end. Morgan Freeman was mind- blowingly authentic in playing Red and was made for the part. The plot was well thought out, and the escape by Andy was surprising even as a viewer. And the last 20 minutes are the best of any movie I've ever seen. It didn't leave you in tears of sadness or happiness, just a fantastic sense of closure. The acting was terrific and a spectacular way to use 2+ hours. Highly recommended and in my Top 10, easily.	9
 extraordinary movie with a little bit melancholy		9
 Great movie about the harshness of life..	"There are so many movies take you by the heart, this one separates itself from the pack by having the special ability of moving you by showing that everyone's life is bitter whoever you are and whatever you do.The cooperation between Frank Darabont and Stephen ""the master of terror"" King is very welcome at every angle in every title they work together and The Shawshank Redemption is the peak of this collaboration. The story is the classical friendship in the most unexpected places with bitter twists found in most Stephen King stories. And the images and the camera angles are carefully and successfully designed and executed.The movie takes you in for 2 hours and 22 minutes of a ride in time and senses."	9
 Pray	"What does this film, and why, in fact, I'm wondering in the first place this issue? Probably because the main idea of ​​what to look for and morality that the film brings to your mind, if it is of course possible - this is the most interesting. Moreover, you understood the book / film - is a kind of specific experience in the treasury of his own thoughts and knowledge.I read Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" Not surprisingly, the book, however, as always, the better the movie. But Frank Darabont took unmatched movie that could play King wrote in his book, and in this film is definitely a plus.So what, exactly, teaches ""The Shawshank Redemption""?Andy Dyufreyn for as much as twenty years, has lost none of its force of will, ruthlessly, albeit slowly, breaking free, with it in secret.Frantic zeal for freedom. Why would it not be worth it. He lost twenty years of his life, because his wife, along with her lover killed by another person. And is it fair?The warden continuously urged Andy to believe in the Bible. Called, until one glorious day it has not broke big check, and the place of its documents and reports that Andy was doing, he found that same Bible, and a note from Dyufreyna himself. Hopelessness, a setup? Not at all, my friends. Andy just gutted out the truth, bringing his tormentor took his own life.And here it is, the same will, the life! Twenty years, he has only seen her in a dream!The very desirable house on the ocean near the Mexican land, a loyal friend, a little later freed Andy Dyufreyna, a small boat and hamburgers from a roadside cafe. He could not. He did it.Freedom of the most expensive."	10
 I give him 9,5/10	I simply love this movie, it just connects to you. Makes you feel like you lived it yourself! With a reason on top of the list. Just a hearth warming story that gives you chills at moments. An really epic movie. If you want the full experience read the book also. Steven King is a master and a true artist! Just few movie remakes of the book are really good and this is one of them. An experience that can't be matched with with just watching the movie or reading just the book. The combination of dose two is one of the greatest things that you can do for the seventh art! I hope you enjoy my review and the movie. And i need to writhe a filler line because i miss 1 line of text so i can post this review.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	"Very well done movie although I don't think it's as good as everybody says... One of the better movies I have watched and it is absolutely worth looking at it, no doubt! Unfortunately I don't like it so much anymore. That can depend on the amount of times I have watched it over the years at school etc. and it has gradually become a little more boring and I don't enjoy it as other movies like Batman. As a Tarantino fan I like more brutality in movies than drama. The actors, story and the quotes in the movie is a big plus though! If you like movies or TV-series that is inside a prison I strongly recommend the TV-series ""Prison Break"". Well, back to the topic. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that is worth watching. If you haven't seen it before it will be a very good movie to watch with your family or friends. As I said earlier I don't like it that much these days but it feels more like it's not really my cup of tea... I give it a 9 out of 10, fare and square. /Andreas Flink"	9
 awesome movie		10
 Not surprised this is the best of 250 movies.	An amazing movie about human nature & real friendship. Hope can be found in the darkest of times. I completely agree that this is the leader of the list.Good camera quality, good work of the actors involved. It is delight to watch the interaction between the actors adding to the magic of the costumes and surroundings. Every frame takes you into the world and story without deviating from the red thread of the story arc.To some the movie might be a bit too long. The plot leaves you with a good and genuine feeling of having watched one of Hollywood's best & brightest at work.	9
 Awesome screenplay	After watching this movie I couldn't find a specific word to describe what I was feeling and what I was thinking, the closest word that I could get was 'amazed'. Every scene of the movie brings up one different feeling, and I think that this is why I liked this movie this much. The dialogs, the actors, the scenario, everything on this movie goes directly to your mind in such a way that it makes you feel tied to the movie and you just can't stop watching it. All the aspects of the movie are great, and that is what makes the movie even better. When I watched this movie, I was paying attention to the screenplay, and in the end of the movie I was delighted with the screenplay. The writer did such an amazing job and built this awesome and unique story about prison. I strongly encourage you to watch this movie because its very hard to get the entire picture of the movie by only reading this review.	10
 Amazing		9
 Remarkable Movie	"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticize it could come across as churlish or contraries, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticize - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be.It's easy to forget how much of a slow-burning success Shawshank was. Despite favorable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate).It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favorite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel-good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption.Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum.The characters reflect the different extents and effects of institutionalization. Brooks has built his entire identity around his books and role in the prison; he is so afraid of this being taken away that he attempts to kill William Sadler's character so he can stay inside. Red is aware of how trapped he is, and shares Brooks' fears, being unsure that he could get things for Andy on the outside. But at the same time, he refuses to let himself be vulnerable, trying to play the system and constantly getting turned down for parole. Andy allows himself to be vulnerable and endures all the pain that it brings him, sustained by the knowledge of his innocence and the hope that he will escape.Shawshank is perhaps the most powerful depiction of hope in all of cinema. The original short story, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption, was subtitled 'Hope Springs Eternal'. The film returns to hope and the celebration of the human spirit like a leitmotif, and succeeds because it retains Andy's humanity in all its many shades. While he is very different to the other prisoners, he is never presented as a saint or goody-goody, smiling formlessly in the face of maddening torment. This makes his endurance all the more powerful: we recognize our faults in his moments of weakness, and aspire to his inner moral strength.The film has attracted many Christian interpretations - in fact, in my review of John Carpenter's The Thing, I called it ""a poster child for Christianity"". It's not hard to see why, considering its celebration of inner strength and devotion, and its overall arc of good triumph over evil against the greatest odds. While Andy has been called a Christ figure, he's just as close to the character of Daniel in the Old Testament: he finds himself in a strange land against his will, and in order to survive he applies his natural talents to the service of his temporal masters. Through his labors the people around him benefit and the system is eventually changed for the better - albeit through pain, suffering and several deaths.An equally intriguing interpretation comes from Mark Kermode, who authored a BFI Modern Classic on the film in 2003. In a video discussing cinematic depictions of Richard Nixon, Kermode made the argument that Warden Norton (played brilliantly by Bob Gunton) is an allegory for Nixon, with Andy's prison term matching Nixon's political career. Norton begins reaching out for friendship (Nixon seeking to be elected), then becomes the corrupt leader (beginning in the year that Kennedy was shot), and finally descends into paranoia and disgrace, culminating in a more literal suicide than Nixon offered us.Whether you believe these interpretations or not, Shawshank is a terrific piece of dramatic film-making which soars on the strengths of its main performers. Tim Robbins perfectly captures Andy's distant, ethereal quality while retaining his wry and infectious sense of humor. Morgan Freeman's performance may well be responsible for his subsequent type-casting, but he matches Robbins beat for beat, offsetting hope with world-weariness and guilt. There's also great support from two actors who would subsequently work with Darabont again - William Sadler (who appears in The Green Mile) and James Whitmore (The Majestic)."	10
 Best movie ever?	First let me say that usually I'm not much into drama. But the beauty of The Shawshank Redemption forced me into watching the whole film four times over the years.It's the kind of movie that is so powerful and realistic you become glued to your seat until the end. The twist at the end gave the movie a perfect finish without affecting the fine gist of the whole movie. Shawshank Redemption teaches us, improves our feelings about the world and changes our expectations about 'luck'. It shows us what a movie can do.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver their best performance ever. It did not sweep the board at the Academy Awards, but that was because of Tom Hank's movie Forrest Gump	9
 Like a silver lining in my darkest time	The shawshank redemption was probably the best film I've ever watched. Somehow it feels like Forrest Gump. The main character, Andy trying to keep he life style despite the fact that he was in prison which is a place of no freedom, no friends.What impressed me is that Andy made Red to get a poster of Rita Hayworth and he stick it to the wall of his cell. We have been told repeatedly in most prison movie that a con should has no privacy and personal belonging, that the jailer will keep destroying everything you have and make you suffer. But Andy somehow managed to keep the sexy poster on his wall, made chess out of own time, that is impressive.To be honest, I was shocked because like everyone else I have been living a life as a slave to the work->eat->sleep->work cycle and just don't have the gut to take the leap of faith into what is waiting beyond.I believe like Andy's dream of living next to the Pacific Ocean, which he made it come true, everyone has a dream of his own and we should try our best to accomplish them.	10
 Great 5 * film	Up there with the best films of all time, great story line, great twist, great film from start to finish! The storyline takes you through the prison life of intelligent banker Andrew Dufresne who even though the crime he has been detained for he did not commit, remains quiet and takes the life sentence on the chin. Throughout the film he encounters many characters, some who take a liking to him for the right reasons, and some for the wrong reasons. But what Andrew is plotting in secret will shock the entire Shawshank prison, and indeed the audience.With twists and turns at every corner, ups and downs and emotional drama, Shawshank is undoubtedly one of the best film ever made.	10

 A spark of hope in another wise gloomy past, present and future		
 A riveting story of Hope and Oppresion	The Shawshank Redemption is an impressive story that focuses on two themes. The main theme is a heart-warming story of perseverance and redemption. The sub-theme is more akin to an exposé of the penal system and the horrors that it creates. These two themes intermingle throughout the entire film until it ends with an anti-climactic revelation that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) has not only beaten the system, personified in Warden Norton (Bob Gunton), but has also managed to save another inmate, 'Red' (Morgan Freeman), from death. The director and producer work together in an impressive combination of screenplay, lighting, sound and editing. I won't spend too much time on the screenplay, simply because I cannot do it justice. However, the writing and acting were impressive to say the least. The actors mingled in a way that very effectively reinforced the two themes stated above. During their time at Shawshank the actors progressively lose their vitality and morality. As the movie progresses all the characters show the oppressive effects of the penal system, both when it is used as designed as well as when it is abused by the Warden. Andy is no exception to this rule. I feel that the film is designed to show us that Andy would be destroyed by Shawshank as well, if he hadn't found the means to be free of it. Lighting and color were another medium that the director took advantage of to portray the misery and glory of Andy's story at Shawshank. The Shawshank Redemption was filmed with a strong preference for harsh lighting. Very rarely in the film is anyone portrayed graciously, even our main character is exemplified for his flaws. The color choices were even more indicative of the harsh realities of Shawshank prison. The prison is practically gray-washed, and would have been almost as effective if it were filmed in black-and-white. This strongly supported the sub-theme that speaks against the penal system. However, when Andy makes the choice to do something with what little freedom he has, there is a significant change in the color of the film. This is most notable in the opening and expansion of the library. During these scenes the lighting and color of the film seems to brighten considerably, showing the viewer that Andy's perseverance of attitude and self-improvement have a distinct effect on the nature of even Shawshank's oppressive walls. The sound and narration of the film also relate well to the film. The sound effects in the film are universally harsh lending weight to the oppressive atmosphere. The stark grinding of metal bars on stone, or the shuffling of inmates feet are sounds that are good examples of this. The narration serves a dual nature. It is almost necessary just to speed the progress of the film that covers a number of years of imprisonment. However, it also teaches us a lot about the history of Shawshank. The narrator's voice is old and seems weighed down with Red's own battle at Shawshank. However, it also holds a measure of Hope, a feeling that seems foreign to the gray walls of the prison. This duality of emotion exemplifies the nature of the war between the two themes of Hope and Oppression.	10
 The Power of Redemption	"This masterpiece, directed by Frank Darabout, explores two men seeking redemption as they dream of freedom in Shawshank prison. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover; he also befriends a convict named Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) as he eventually gains the respect of the other inmates. Roger Deakins' cinematography has the ability to capture Andy's sense of determination and optimism in Shawshank prison. This unforgettable drama deeply explores the essence of hope as the audience learns that ""some birds are not meant to be caged; their feathers are just too bright."""	10
 By far the most moving film	In the same year this awesome film was made, I watched Pulp Fiction which changed my interest in films from a pastime, to a major part of my life. However, for some odd reason I never saw Shawshank at the cinema and it wasn't until 1999 that I became the happy owner of this film on a ropey VHS tape. Two years passed by when Stella (Artois) were advertising a promotional event, enabling you to drink their beer whilst watching a movie in a quirky location relevant to the film. So we watched Dead Poet's at an Oxford College and then came this opportunity to view Shawshank at Oxford's old disused prison :-) Arriving at the prison, actors were dressed as U.S prison guards, verbally berating us and marched us through the fantastic old prison (now a swanky hotel), through to the prison yard where we viewed this epic again, but this time on a huge screen, in the best possible setting, with my lovely wife to be, and a few bottles of suds :-) To say this was the one of the best days of my life apart from our eventual wedding and the birth of our 2 children of course, is not an exaggeration! The sad thing is, nearly 20 years have gone by since the making of this film, and all flicks since have not touched the wonder of this movie.	
 Beautiful	A must watch movie. Redefines the emotions like hope and trust etc. The character of Morgan Freeman is also fantastic. Got to know what prison is . Life Sentence is one of the most torturous Punishment one can get. The planning process of the escape is just mind boggling. But I still can't believe that a person can keep his hope for this long. Al though I doubt that in 19 years, his cell was not changed. But of course this movie was released way back in 1994. Got to know much about American prison and prisoner- maintenance system that existed then. Morgan Freeman plays his character well and so does Tim. every part of the movie will be well understood as the movie progresses. Its a long but interesting movie. After all, these many internet reviewers cant be wrong. But it is not the best movie of all times.	9

 A story of human tenacity and persistence		9
 Love Morgan Freeman	A very good movie. It is possible that the men (adult males) will find this movie more appealing than women (adult females). Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give very good performances. In particular, Morgan Freeman excels like he seems to always do in his movies. I can never get used to the type of character that Morgan Freeman plays because of his versatility of roles he has played. The movie, although not fast paced, draws you in and keeps you interested. I could have sat through an additional 20-30 more minutes of film. However, the movie appears to be of sufficient length. Quite to my surprise, the ending was not entirely predictable. Older children (10+ years) would also enjoy this movie. This is not a chick flick so boys don't bring your date to this one. OK to share with long term girlfriend or wife though. This move does not inspire romance nor was its intent. A good film to sit down with popcorn.	5
 Shwashank redemption and Joseph of the Bible	The other day I saw Shwashank Redemption (yeah yeah, I had to be clobbered to watch it, more fool me). What an intense movie! Yes it is an epic movie, yes its beautifully narrated, but what struck me most was this movie reminded me of Joseph, son of Jacob in the bible.I mean look at the similarities- Joseph the favorite of Jacob, apple of his fathers eye. Joseph who dreamed about ruling over his brothers. And here we have Andy, the blue eyed genius of the banking sector, who has it all, money, position and a beautiful wife.Joseph is cheated by his brothers and sold into slavery. He is then tempted by his boss's wife, and he resists the temptation in good faith. But anyway he is falsely implicated and sent to prison. Andy gets cheated by his wife and best friend, in a fit of drunken rage Andy entertains the idea of harming then, but quickly sobers up and resists the temptation. Andy also gets falsely implicated.So now we have two innocent men in prison, but both don't let circumstances deter them. Both use their talents where they were placed and grow and rise to new heights. Joseph found favor with the warden and became in charge of the prisoners. Andy started filing tax returns for all of the prison guards and was made the library in charge.Joseph is freed from prison because of his ability to interpret dreams. Joseph is made the governor of the land and becomes very prosperous. Andy's banking skills allow him the leeway to manage his escape from prison. Andy comes across great wealth that he was managing for the warden.And finally Joseph gets reunited to his family, while Andy gets reunited with Red who was his friend from the prison.Amazing coincidence, ain't it?	8
 The 4th Greatest Film of 1994 (In My Opinion)		8
 Redemption	Great narration by Freeman, as always.I felt they set the mood and pace in the prison very well. I think the acting by Robbins could have been a bit more emotional or clear, as sometimes he seemed a bit dull. Acting by Freeman was great and his final release from prison held emotion.Also touching was the final letter from the old guy who got released from prison. I believe his suicide speech was one of the best parts of the film and Freeman's explanation of it very deep.I feel like the one thing the movie was missing was a dramatic vengeance on his wife's killer. It is the one thing that could have truly caused full completion. Even if this added another hour to the movie, I believe this would have been worth it.	
 best	I can't say enough about this film its simply the King of Kings when it comes to movies.Other movies might have something better, but put all the contents of a great movie together and this one hast is all Narration, acting, humour, direction, story, suspense, soundtrack...the full package.Its a powerful movie and I don't know how you can keep your emotions in check with such a intense story. Its a tragedy this didn't win an Oscar for best picture over Forrest Gump...for me there isn't many movies that possess the overall strength of this movie, hence why its still #1 in on IMDb and top 5 on many other reputable internet sites.	8
 The Greatest Revenge Story of All Time	Well, not only that but perhaps the greatest film of all time as well.Tim Robbins and more-so Morgan Freeman give their best performances ever.It is perhaps a crime this did not win best picture but at least it was nominated and I cant really get to mad as Forrest Gump is a top 10 movie ever.This is 3 hours but it just flies by.The characterization is perfect.One of the most unique dynamics of the film is we all root on Andy Dufresne (Robbins) without knowing for sure if he is actually the murderer or not.We also feel compassion and empathy for Red (Morgan Freeman) even though HE DID commit murder.You get to like these characters a great deal learning about their personality inside the Shawshank Prison.The Wardon and the guards abuse their power making Andys escape one of the most feel good endings of all time.You cant help but smile.A movie everyone should see, numerous times and have in their collection.Get busy living..or get busy dying...	10
 Deserves 10 Stars, But Not #1		10
 I Hope!		10
" touch my heart ,,,,,,one word ""one of greatest movie of all time"""	"this movie teach us about life,hope,dream,freedom ...diaouge of the movie are more and more effective.a sweet voice of Morgan freeman is amazing and Tim Robbins gave best performance of his career.brooks also a fantastic character..i watched this movie at first time at the age of 19 ..in this year 2013..it is still amazing and best after 20 years of its released. ONE WORD i will watch it still last time of my life...GREAT MOVIE THE SHAWSHANK AND REDEMPTION.story line of it is fantastic.directorial part also best and the musics or background musics it is just no word.one scene of movie i alway want to see is oak tree scene. a line ""remember red :hope is a good thing,may be the best of things and no good thing ever dies."	10
 The Best Film Ever Made	I can see from the bulk of the reviews on this page that I don't have to write a glowing review of this film...but I want to. Having read most of Steven Kings work I cant tell you how many times I have been let down by films made from his writing. In my opinion however this film surpasses his story so much so that it becomes the best film ever made. Morgan Freeman's narration of the film gives me goose bumps,the story just grabs hold and will not let you go. This film is long but I guarantee when you reach the end you will wish it would just keep going. The DVD is lacking in special features which is a shame because I'm sure I would have watched those countless times as well. All in all I say not only should everyone see this movie (rent it now!!!) but own it as I do.	10
 A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.	A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching. Go listen dialogs like 'you get busy living or you get busy dying'. They are like music to ears.	8
 Perfection	To anyone that says Forrest Gump was the best movie then you are insane. The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie I have ever watch. It doesn't have any problems whatsoever. While Morgan Freeman takes most of the attention, Tim Robbins was absolutely incredible. The Movies overall message is inspiring and is one that will truly make you smile. The movie is long but it is just the length that it needs to be and won't bother you. What sets this movie apart though is the acting. The acting was on a level I don't think we have seen since. The movie is one of the best of all time and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good story	10
 Shawshank review	The Shawshank Redemption is perhaps one of the most well thought out and intricate movies of its time. Released in 1994 The Shankshank Redemption stars Andy Dufresne played by Tim Robbins along side Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding played by Morgan Freeman. When Andy is convicted of double homicide he is sent to live out his days under Wardon Norton in a small imaginary town in Maine. To say the least Andy makes the most of his life on the inside. . Andy with his sly smile and cleaver tactics weaves himself deep into the prisons web of secrets and lies, but the prison is not the only thing hiding secrets. The secrets that are held in books that Andy keeps for the warden are nothing compared to the secrets the lie behind the walls of Andy's very own cell. This movie is so good it is hard to describe in words. It is truly amazing how you pull for each and every character despite their questionable pasts. This movie will have you pulling for convicted felons in a way you never imaged you could. From beginning to end this story brings you back in time right inside those cinder-block walls. It brings you through the friendship, tragedy and ultimately the redemption of Andy Dufrane.	
 Must read before viewing!		10
 Best film I have ever seen	I usually don't write reviews but this has got to be said, hands-down the most magnificent movie I have ever seen! One of the few movies that actually made me cry and I'm a grown man. It had it's cries, laughs, anger, and happiness all in one complete package. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and this film truly holds him to be legendary. There is nothing about this movie I would change, absolutely perfect no complaints here. I can watch this 10+ times and still have the emotions I had when I first watch it. A must watch for everyone (age appropriate of course) because this is a masterpiece you cannot not see. You feel what the characters feel, you are part of the movie. Beautiful, stunning and heartwarming, I cannot stress enough how much this movie touched me.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption (A)------my Rating: 4.5/5 stars EXCELLENT		9
 Possibly the Best of All Time		10
 A Story That Provides Hope!	"This has been one of my favorite movies since I saw it originally in the theater in late 1994, as well as being one of my favorite Stephen King stories (released as part of ""Different Seasons"" in 1982 and subtitled ""Hope Springs Eternal""). Why this movie/story has such an effect on me is because it represents hope in the face of incredible odds and it is one I watch whenever I feel like I have lost hope in humankind. All of the elements that make excellent motion picture entertainment are here - stunning cinematography, beautiful and uplifting music, enthralling and gripping story, and talented acting by all those selected for the roles. Frank Darabont also deserves credit for meshing all of these elements into an unforgettable experience that I never tire of. Perhaps the most memorable line in the movie is uttered by Morgan Freeman (""Red"") - ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"" - and how it applies to life in general."	10

 The Shawshank Redemption | A brief review by a Film Making student	"*Contain Spoilers*The Shawshank Redemption (1994) Director - Frank Darabont Cinematographer – Roger Deakins Writers – Stephen King and Frank Darabont Editor – Richard Francis-BruceFavorite Quote: ""Hope is a good thing and good things never die."" The Shawshank Redemption is about time, patience, hope and loyalty. In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (protagonist) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, picks him as the new recruit. The first part of the film deals with Andy, Red and their group of friends dealing with prison life.Andy wants to be a freeman. He regrets his past and wants to move on with a new life and memories. But the ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy. A corrupt warden, sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack. He has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red.After almost a two decade stay, in 1966, Andy Dufresne escapes the Shawshank prison by tunneling through the wall with a rock hammer worn down to the nub. He sets off to a new country for a new life and is later accompanied by his prison mate Red.Andy Duresne is a man of hope. He is a smart person and a loyal friend. The Shawshank Redemption is the journey of redemption of Andy and his fellow convicts. Redemption is found in many ways, by many characters, even by a bird named Jake. It's a story portraying the corruption and politics in a prison and the transformation of an investment banker to a smart con. It shows how the weak and innocent protagonist, who is often bullied and tortured during his early stay in prison, adapts and changes himself with the situation and out smarts the guards and warden to run away with their illegal money and starts a new life.Review By – Mayank Bhattacharya"	9
 It Gives Us The Best Of Things : Hope		10
 You need to see this movie	"Anyone who has not watched this movie needs to. Morgan Freeman's role really defined my generation. His performance as ""Red"" was probably the best I've ever seen.I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan, in fact this role is the only one I like, maybe Bull Durham...but not on this level. Andy Dufrane, really makes the best of what would simply drive most of us to the brink of insanity. He did it because he found friends. Which did become his family.Andy was a difficult man to know, he was so smart so intelligent. Even Red his friend who was telling the story didn't really seem to understand him, at least until the end. I love it how Andy had to put himself into positions to make the prison is own. He got himself out of a bad situation by befriending his enemies, and then when the time was right, taking them out. While in their minds they were using Andy for their benefits, but Andy knew he used them...brilliant.These two friends in a sense had their own lives defined by their friendship. How many people can say that have ever had a friend like that? I hope that in the next 20 years my best friend, will have help define me.The best thing about this movie, is how simple they made it. ""Get Busy Livin' or get busy dyin."" That in and of itself is advice we all need, especially when work or school seems to dictate our routines.My advice watch this movie. It is the best of the last 50 years. Period."	10

 The Best Prison Movie		9
 Film That Always Gives Us Hope!	"Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, James Whitmore and Clancy Brown star in this 1994 drama based on Stephen King's short story, ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption."" This tells of mild-mannered Banker, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) who is framed for murdering his wife and her lover. He's sent to New England prison, Shawshank where he befriends convicted murderer, Ellis Redding aka ""Red"" (Freeman). Andy also puts up with corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Gunton) and his Guard Captain, Byron Hadley (Brown). Andy doesn't let them or the prison get the best of him because he has hope keeping him going. Sadler (Die Hard 2) plays prison inmate, Haywood who is friends with Red and Andy and the late, Whitmore (Psycho) plays their other friend, Brooks. I love this film, Robbins and Freeman are terrific in it and together, the rest of the cast is good as well and Thomas Newman's score is excellent. This is the film that always gives us hope and I highly recommend it."	9
 Stephen King's best adaptation	The Shawshank Redemption is actually a short novel written by Stephen King. Tim Robbins is falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife. He becomes best friends with Morgan Freeman and plots an escape using a small hammer to slowly create an opening in the wall which is covered with posters.Freeman narrates the story and he and Robbins make a terrific pair struggling to survive prison life while keeping their sanity. They manage to make it through their days by dreaming of the perfect escape. King has written a tale of hope and inspiration which is adapted with great style and grace by Frank Darabont. He later made King's Green Mile in 1999, another excellent prison drama.	9
 We oversee Andy Dufrane's visit in prison.		9
 greatest film ever	never the less the best film i have seen so far its been a while since Hollywood made a film with some heart in it, its about time for that to happen again I do miss those i wonder when this is going to happen again the collaboration between a great director and an amazing cast is pretty rare this days, also wondering when the director is going to come out with a new film that would shake the cinema world. its a pity sometimes to go and pay 10-15$ for a film that has never made my emotions tweak. I wish it will happen sooner than later. although there are some good movies here and there, still am waiting for another perfect one that leaves you sitting down wondering what just happened in the last 90 to 200 minutes.	10
 Shawshank's Genius Makes Harsh Critics Look Stupid		10
 No wonder its #1 on IMDb!!! AMAZING MOVIE!!!		10
 Get busy living, or get busy dying.	Of all the prison movies I have ever seen, The Shawshank Redemption is easily the best of them all. And of all the movies based on Stephen King's novels and novellas, this is the best adaptation. It was a shame it did not win any of the Oscars it was nominated for. I think it is one of the best movies to be made in so many years in cinematic history. It gives you insight on what life would be like if you were in prison. This movie focuses on a man sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, which he did not commit. Tim Robbins is one of the most talented actors around. He plays his role with a lot of heart, soul and conviction. His best film role to date. Morgan Freeman is also very talented, he also played his role with a lot of heart, soul and and conviction. This is also his best film role to date. And finally hands off to Bill Gunton for his role as the wicked prison warden. His character is an absolute bad ass. The Shawshank Redemption is a true masterpiece.	10
 Excellent story, Excellent directing, Excellent acting	I will start with a basic summary:This movie starts out with a banker(Tim Robbins) who supposedly killed his wife and her lover while drunk. This led to a conviction and prison sentence. Most of the story takes place in this prison, Shawshank. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the main characters, who become best friends who use their friendship as a means to escape from the hell of prison and the devil in their warden. Tim (Andy), a brilliant man, manages to make a slightly better prison life for himself and his fellow inmates by helping out the warden with basic office things. However, this was not enough for him. He need to escape, and escape he did in the most spectacular way. Now, I will give my opinion on the film:This film is something that you should devote time to watching when you have no interruptions. Turn off your cellphone and unplug your home phone before watching it because the greatness of this film is something that shouldn't be interrupted. The story line is perfect. The acting is perfect. The characters are so deep and gripping. The setting is excellent. If you have money, I would definitely recommend that you buy this in blu-ray (if you have blu-ray player) and connect it to a surround sound system, because you will want to hear every spoken word, every fallen leaf, every gust of wind, every detail.This is one of about only 5 movies that I give a solid 10 stars.	10
 Intense Drama	I should say that usually I'm not much into drama. But the beauty of The Shawshank Redemption magically forced me into watching the whole film three times over the years.Its the kind of movie that is so powerful and realistic you become glued to your seat until the end. The twist at the end gave the movie a perfect finish without affecting the fine gist of the whole movie. Shawshank Redemption teaches us, improves our feelings about the world and changes our expectations about 'luck'.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins deliver their best performance to date. If Tom Hank's movie Forrest Gump was not made in the same year, this would most certainly be the winner of the 67th academy awards.	10
 The Conceptual Review.		8
 Don't watch this movie...	Yes. No need to watch this movie, instead just play it on DVD, close your eyes and just listen to Morgan Freeman's narration of a prison Life, Hope, Friendship and the days in Shawshank. Every important move in this movie is described by Morgan and his voice is such a plus that it lift the movie to next level.In a scene, where the entrance of the prison tower was shown in the top angle, it shows the world in to which the prisoners are entering. It is a sample scene where the director relied on cameraman to convey the message instead of 10 line dialog.Everyone expects Morgan and Tim to become friends after all both of them are big actors. It is predictable. But the way the friendship develops is truly amazing screenplay.Many sub-plots, people with different attitude were shown in the movie. Not all of them are good people. But most of the characters are in transformation phase where they repent for their mistakes.Poetic scene ? Many scenes are there. But the one in which Morgan, Tim and others drink beer at the top of the roof of one of the building and the way Morgan narrates the scene.. Amazing...It contains a twist which is a ingredient for any thriller movie. Yet that brilliant scene is so subtle that everyone appreciate.Will there be any other movie in our life time where it can be simple yet be so powerful and heart touching ?. Doubt we will see such a movie soon.As many said before, don't rent it.. instead buy this movie and keep it safe for next generation to see this movie..Hats off to Morgan, Tim and everyone who acted in this master piece...	10
 Sheer Brilliance!!		9
 Paying a tribute to Bogart?	Therecare a lot of movies where plot takes place in a prison, with 'innocent' in-mates, cruel warden and a breathtaking escape but I'm almost sure that the director wanted to pay tribute to Bogart& Bacall's Dark Passage. There are some particular elements in the plot that resemble the 50 years old film such as; the ending scene on a south American Pacific beach (here Mexico then it was Peru), a bus ride thru the Mexican border, an innocent fugitive etc. (Morgan Feeeman of course is not Bacall...ha ha ).The rest of the story, or better to say almost all of it is an entirely different . Tim Robins and M.F work together with harmony , even pouring some humor into the gloomy atmosphere of the Shawshank prison.	8
 Hope Can Set You Free	"We bought a piece of land. It was embarrassingly overgrown in weeds. It had trash deposited on it. We used swingblades to chop through the growth to get down to the ground. One day as I was swinging, a man walking down the road said, ""You bought a bunch of weeds."" It was true, but they were my bunch of weeds. I kept working. It's like there was nothing beautiful to see, but I saw it - I could see beauty, when there was no beauty there to see; and, yet, there was beauty there to see, it just was unseen to most eyes - but it was there.As spring came, something else came - daffodils. They were everywhere; vibrant yellow on green stems; life amongst death; beauty amongst ruin. Nature itself was saying there is hope; life was springing back with death and ruin its backdrop. Chickweed flourished everywhere; lush green, much greener than grass. The ground was a blanket of green; the lushest weed that had ever brought such pleasure to my eye. It flourishes in the spring, it dies out in the summer, and reappears in the fall. Its like waiting for a friend to come, then go, only to come again.""The Shawshank Redemption"" reminded me of such hope and life amongst despair and death. Of good and evil, with awfulness many times seeking to overcome goodness and put it out, only to see goodness, even if brought to death, shine through the darkness.A tagline for this movie says, ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."" Brooks hanged himself; Red embraced hope. I thought of Revelation 21:8 where it says, ""But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."" The first kind of person mentioned is the fearful. I thought of Brooks, he had a chance at life - but, he chose death. He was fearful. There will be those who enter (chose) eternal death because they were fearful. The prison doors have been opened, they are told they can have liberty and freedom, and yet, like Brooks, fear holds them prisoners to death; they seal their own death, they enter eternal death.Red came to the same place as Brooks, yet, he made a different decision; he chose the hope set before him.Red, along with Andy, enjoyed their paradise. They chose to hope, and to follow that hope; that hope led them into life.As for our land, that ""bunch of weeds"" to the man walking by, it too has followed hope into life. People now say, ""You sure got it looking good."" We even had a land speculator contact us - wanting to buy our land. She ain't for sale. I may not be able to fully accomplish my hope on that land in my lifetime - but, I can hope. Every day, I can hope. Every spring, I can see the daffodils come back after winter. I can see the lush green chickweed come and go and come again. Andy and Red had a boat and the Pacific Ocean.A plastic Wal-mart chair under the shade of the trees, with the seemingly ever-present, gentle breeze is my Pacific Ocean.Hope can set you free."	
 I saw this in the cinema - yes i'm the one!!!	"It wasn't even my idea. It was a female friends idea. I hadn't read any reviews. So i went and i watched it. And i thought it was quite a pleasant, well-made film. I didn't think it was the best film ever made. It was obviously different to your average Hollywood Blockbuster (the same year's Pulp Fiction it is not!)- slow paced with a director happy not to rush things.And here we are nearly 20 years later and it's a lot of people's favourite film. It's not my favourite film but it's grown on me and i've been forced to reappraise it. And now i think it's a lovely film, lovingly made and when you've had enough of aliens blowing up The Whitehouse, scantily clad students dancing and wise-cracking cops shooting everything insight this is the antidote and really there should be more films made like this. It puts the ""good"" in ""feel good movie""."	
 Worth watching this movie when u lose your confidence	Whenever i watch this movie a new confidence boosts me up. This is the success of the movie. No matter how old you are , if u have the confidence in you u can succeed. I could see more awards & praises for MOrgan Freeman but I would say Tim Robbins did well to the character as a banker. Each & every character didn't spoil the flow. Superb editing & screenplay. Kudos to the entire team. Movie is 20 years old and looking fresh even one. Friendship is another keyword that has been incorporated at the right amount. I could compare Life is beautiful movie with this one. It also inspired me to have the confidence at all time. This is one of my favorite movie of all time ..	
 In everybody's's list of great movies for a good reason	"Two thousand four hundred and five IMDb users have bothered to write a review of this movie. I read all of them and did not find a bad one. Of course I didn't! I had not seen the movie and that is true. Every single one of my friends and acquaintances has, and not surprisingly, recommended it with the highest of praise. The fact that I had not did put into question my claim to be a movie lover. Now that I have, I admit it serves me right to have been questioned so.It is a damn good movie for all the reasons everyone wrote in their reviews and why critics also raved about it. I have no excuse for not watching it before other than my prejudice toward any movie having to do with jails, the prison life etc..Halfway into the movie, I was not convinced my prejudice about movies dealing in any way with prison would change, but the acting was good enough to keep me going. I was very happy with the direction this movie took, especially with the ending. Not since ""The Birdman from Alcatraz"" and Escape from Alcatraz have I enjoyed a movie that has prison as the setting; I don't expect it will soon either since my phobia with that is not going away soon. Finally, having seen Shawshank, I can now have an intelligent conversation about movies with friends and acquaintances without risking admonition for my failing to see the movie. Anybody that hasn't seen it yet and claims some knowledge of movies deserves, as I did, to be castigated. I've made my peace with the matter and I'm moving on."	9
 10 out of 10	Great movies. I've seen it countless times but it is not enough. This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. http://www.qtv.vn	
 Wow.		10
 A telling story	This is a classic, I have seen this movie many times over the years and it still create interest and drama to me. I am literally glued to the screen watching this movie. I ready like how the main character was able to use his educational ability to help not only the prisoners but also the administrators of the prison.it ready shows having a education or skill can assist your in life. But it also showed that you can be manipulated base on what situation you find yourself. Morgan Freeman is a classic, as usual is play a stunning role and capture the audience on the screen. Hats off to the producers and directors of this movie who really told a story about innocents, persecution and survival.	
 Ties with Forrest Gump as my #1 ATF		10
 no winner at those Oscars	so much beauty in the friendship we see in this film, greatest film I've ever seen. when this film was up for the best picture oscat, im glad it was, the Oscar goes to, and not the winner is, because that year the was no winner. just such beauty in every film up, not to this date have a never seen a line up like that for best picture and the best actor. tom hanks, no doubt played the best role of he's life but morgan freeman played a role of the century. tim robbins was outstanding in fact the whole cast were terrific.if this film is the last film im ever gonna see then let it be it, because I've watched something worth dreaming forever about.	10
 Good movie and a must watch for good movie fans	I watched ShawRed as the first movie on my PC when i bought it. Some how the engineer who formatted my drive put this movie along with few other movies for me to see as he had limited collection of movies. I watched this movie and I simply loved it, especially the end. Along with time this movie has grown over me and the more i think about it, the more i like it. It truly deserves all the recognition it is getting, though i do not consider it better than Godfather but still i find it a masterpiece movie. Great acting by both leads, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. In fact, everyone acted well in this movie. The direction deserves standing ovation and Frank Darabont, the director also deserves hats off for his very gripping screenplay. It is very difficult to maintain much interest of audience in same interior scenes if they keep repeating themselves but DOP has done a fine job too. All n all a master movie and for new generation it is a must watch to know what movies were made just twenty years back.	10
 Great Great Great	The Shawshank Redemption is an instant classic by far.This is probably one of the most greatest movies of all time.Tim Robbins did the role tremendously.Morgan Freeman made the movie what it is today.I love this movie.Im telling you if you haven't seen this movie watch it right now.you will fall in love with the movie.The first time i saw this movie it almost brought tears to my eyes.The director Frank Darabont is a genius for this movie and we also have to thank Stephan King for writing the book.Both of those guys are amazing.please if you haven't seen the movie watch it, it will blow your mind.those who have seen this movie don't you agree with me?? This movie is great.	10
 Unique creation of Hope and passion in reel	"As a matter of rarity would it have ever happened, while u watch a movie u wish let this continue forever, let there be no end to the story. With its essence of hope, desire, honesty, purity, passion, brilliance and much more ""Shawshank Redemption"" is one such creation in reel. It started with a question ""whats so special about this movie to top IMDb"". It ended with much than just an answer. It made me get up from my bed, start my notebook and share my happiness with you all. I have never done this before. To acclaim the screenplay, acting, direction would need more than just words of English dictionary. On a lighter note, be the best in what you are doing, you never know, it may become your savior one day. It is a must watch for everyone. Hope Against hope and life beyond boundaries are one of many points I take away from this movie. Before I sign out, Frank Darabont, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman take a bow."	
 Shawshankk Redemption	"The Shawshank Redemption released in 1994 in my opinion is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The movie has a great story and even better characters. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence. Andy forms a friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the entrepreneur of the jail. Both men face many trial and tribulations while incarcerated. But in the end the only thing these two men have in the world are each other and hope, which to them is the only thing ""the man"" can't take from them. The movie is full of great acting, with a theme of hope and friendship it illustrates human triumph over hardships. Nominated for 7 Oscars this movie was powerful in every way. What you will take away from this movie in the 150 minutes will give you a lifetime of lessons from the heart."	
 Movie for mind		
 The Best Movie ever made in the history of the Cinema		10
 wow. just wow.	truly, the most inspiring a wonderful movie of all time. i first watched this film about four weeks ago, and that was when i realized i was missing out. in the past four weeks, i have watched this film 9 times: more than i've watched most other films over many years.to use an old cliché, the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts, is very apt. no single part of this film is stellar. but for some reason, it all pulls together to provide an emotionally packed, awe inspiring film.***SPOILER*** the feel good film of all time, it keeps you amazed all the way through, culminating in an ending which could break even the strongest of souls.this is one film where it will never grow old, and the ending will never, ever fail to move me.	
 Best movie ever!	"One of the few movies that really succeed into telling a story as much as grabbing you with it, few other movies do that. As a powerful message that you can relate to and be inspired by. Genius if you're able to buy it don't think :""Should I?"" well here's my answer of course you caca-dudy... You know if you can't there's always the TV not like that's gonna get away from you. And yes there are other movies you may like MORE than this one but it's undeniably one of the bes at every category (except comedy but that's why Johnny's there) and if you watch this movie and hate on it or EVEN think that it is overrated then you can go to hell and i don't certainly don't wanna know you. Why is (as far as i know) the best movie ever? Because of the effect it lives you with such a powerful message of freedom friendship and glory (just like Stand by me) can not get overstated, buy it if you can't or see it on TV i don't know as long as you see this masterpiece, that's all it coounts, damn it!"	
 Very Good	This is a great movie with a great storyline and tremendous performances. The movie is best viewed in the television edited version because it is a story for the whole family if the language and unnecessary sexual scenes are omitted. I have spent many Sunday mornings watching this movie on TNT. I was totally shocked when we rented the movie for a trip and watched the unedited version. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as usual. Tim Robbins plays his part perfectly although he does not appear to possess the physical attributes necessary in some parts of the film. The plot develops with perfect timing and the music works well with the time, location and story. It is a movie that can be seen over and over again due to its timeless plot.	
 Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were outstanding..Will watch again		
 They don't make them like this anymore.		
 Simply sublime!	Wow!!! And just in case I haven't made my self clear enough, WOW!!!! There are movies you kinda enjoy, good ones and even the occasional welcome surprise. And then, seldom, you come across a movie like this one. The kind where the end titles have already gotten to the soundtrack part, but you still haven't budged not believing what just hit you. This is a story which will take you on a truly beautiful journey, through all possible emotions, always under the steady guidance of Morgan Freeman's unequaled narrative. Tim Robbins is simply brilliant, making the evolution from docile, even fragile, inmate to jailbreak mastermind a riveting experience. All in all, I have always found it surprising, given the bleak prison life dominating the film's story, how this movie is foremost a tale of perseverance, true friendship and hope.	10
 a movie for every one to like ..not like the pure drama movies that has its people.		9
 The greatest movie ever		10
 My All-Time Favourite	Possibly the greatest movie i have ever seen and definitely the best in this genre and storyline . great cinematography, acting (specially by Morgan Freeman) & directing . the best thing i loved about this film was the switching of the narrator and leading character from time to time . another great thing about the film is the direction of photography and filming. also great adapted screenplay . watch this film alone and with attention and it will really get you involved and thinking and thats the beauty of it. watching it once wont give you much of the taste of it so its best if you watch it at least a few times . Definitely an urgent . don't continue with your life until you haven't seen this.	10
 Very Good movie.... in all aspects	"This movie deserves all the accolades it has received over the years. The character development was excellent. The acting was excellent... and the storyline itself was very good, and developed beautifully throughout the film. I have watched this movie several times (as it is one of those films you can watch again and again), and each time it still captures my attention through to the end. I wont dive too much into details on the plot of the film (as it is a very well known movie); but will note that it is a definite 'must see' for all those who consider themselves ""movie connoisseurs"". There are not too many negatives (if any) that can be said on the film. I will state, however, it's current #1 ranking on the IMDb Top 250 is a little bit high though. Morgan Freeman(Red) was extraordinary in this film. Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne)has nothing on his resume close to his performance here (maybe his performance in Arlington Road). As for resumes, if this is not on your 'movies seen' resume, you need to improve yourself!"	9
 Never Give Up Hope: A Great Message to Live By	This wasn't the first prison movie I've seen. The ones I had seen before this consisted of gangs of criminals brutally murdering each other. Or it involved drug dealers who ran the prison, without the slightest sign of any law force slowing them down.This movie has those elements, but doesn't exploit them as many prison movies often do. There is no epic fight or riot scene in the end. That's what I enjoy about this movie. It's not about deranged dealers, psychotic killers, or blood thirsty rapist. There normal people (more or less) living in this world that many will never have to witness. (Be thankful for that.) I'm not really sure if this is a spoiler or not because it doesn't change much in the story, but Tim Robbins plays a man falsely accused of killing his wife and her lover. It was a misstep to make him innocent, as it would of made his character more 'real' to have made a mistake in his life that he deeply regrets, as Red has. Red, played by Morgan Freeman, is the actors best role to date, and he's had many great roles in his career. You sympathize with this character greatly and you actually come to care for his fate much more than you do Andy's (Robbins).Overall, I think this a wonderful film that is very well written (based off a great short story by the master of horror, Stephen King), well directed, perfectly acted, with a satisfying ending (though I can see how some can call it a typical 'Hollywood'ending).That being said, is classifying it number one on IMDb justice? No. I'd be more than happy with it in the top 100, but the fact is there are better films out there, some which aren't even in the top 250. So I give it a final score 8/10, I think I'm being fair when I say that.	8
 Amazing!	Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are absolutely fantastic in this movie. Its a movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored. It keeps us on the edge of our seat. Fantastic directing, and to learn it was originally wrote by Stephen King (the best writer of all time in my opinion) just makes it even more brilliant. If you haven't seen this before you need to, its a movie for life. The ending is phenomenal. But be warned there is violence in this movie and some disturbing scenes, but to be honest without them it wouldn't be that good. I love this movie and i wouldn't be able to understand anybody who would dislike it. Watch It ! You will love it.. P.s there are always people who seem to be looking for a similar movie, Midnight Express is based on a true story, it may not be exactly like TSR but its close to its brilliance.	10
 Great but not the greatest.	"After reading reviews countlessly recommending the reader to watch this film if they hadn't already I decided to dedicate some time and money to get the film on blu-ray and sit down with some food and drink and prepare to admire a so called ""masterpiece"". I wasn't disappointed....a lot.The film grips you from the beginning, the story line promising, good actors being introduced right left and center, however the film has its moments where some sub plots make you lose interest, I found myself drifting off into a day dream a couple of times throughout the film. However then it got back on track sensing a great finale which it delivered.I still thoroughly enjoyed the film and believe 8/10 is justified, it is by no means perfect and by no means the best, but it is up there and I do recommend it."	8
 The most beautiful movie of all time.		9
 As good a movie as you'll ever see	"My gosh, where to begin with this movie.....practically everything was nailed, spot-on. The story is as compelling and ultimately uplifting as one will ever find in cinema -- from the very get-go we see Andy Dufresne in a courtroom, being sentenced to life in prison for the murder of two people. So instinctively, we believe this must be true -- after all the judge did rule him guilty, right? But over time Andy grows on us, until we learn of his actual innocence, and by the end of the movie one can't help but root him on in his pursuit of freedom. Tim Robbins is the perfect assignment to play Andy, as Robbins' lesser-known status as an actor (as opposed to Tom Hanks, who was considered for this role) eases his task of being the quiet, tranquil Andy who prefers to keep to his own business. Andy's easygoing yet pensive nature makes him the ideal protagonist, as he is an independent thinker yet he can peacefully interact with all others.His friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman) is the backbone of The Shawshank Redemption. Red, a contraband smuggler, may be different from Andy in almost all respects, but over the years Andy earns Red's respect through his acts of courage and selflessness. This movie teaches that title does not have to dictate behavior -- a man who is in prison can be as kind and generous as anyone outside of prison walls -- it all depends on how far you're willing to look into that man's heart. I also love the fact that the friendship of the two men heightens very gradually -- that seems far more realistic than the instant-friends that one often sees in all mediums of story telling. This one takes time to develop, creating a profundity in the relationship and contributing to one of the movie's themes (time). This theme teaches us how much things can change over time, and also lends to the purported notion that Andy and Red have been in prison for a very long time.Red's narration is one of the standout features of The Shawshank Redemption. It is both poignant and insightful, allowing us unlimited access to his mind, which makes our empathy for him so real. While in most other films we learn about characters only through dialogue, in this one Red divulges practically everything to us. His abandonment of hope and eventual love for Andy makes him a tragic figure that should pull at the heartstrings of all viewers. When we first see him attempt to receive parole in 1947, he seems to be no more than an unfeeling criminal. But by 1967 when he's trying to leave Shawshank Prison after 40 years of incarceration, we hang on every word of his memorable ""rehabilitated"" speech. And when he meets Andy on the beach in the final scene, and the two peacefully embrace with a hug as the camera fades away, it is hard to hold back tears of joy.A significant aspect of this film is its theme of institutionalization. We are made to scrutinize exactly what prison does to people. How does a man adapt to freedom again, once he has been released? All Brooks Hatlen could land was a job as a grocery bagger and a room in a halfway house. This inauspicious lifestyle, plus the insecurities of being away from familiar faces while among all the technological/social changes since the start of his 50-year sentence, overwhelmed Brooks, as we all saw in a speechlessly dramatic suicide scene. Red lived in much the same fear before he decided to take off and cross the border to visit Andy. So we're forced to ask ourselves: does even a finite prison sentence essentially end the free will of its recipient? Is it better to leave the inmate in prison in certain cases? This cuts deeply into the philosophy of society's legal system.But the overarching theme of The Shawshank Redemption is hope. Hope is a wonderful, vital virtue that should never be absent in any human heart. Andy echoes this through his audacious acts (be it offering financial advice to Hadley or playing classical music over the prison intercom (which is one of the finest scenes you will ever see in cinema)). He vocalizes his faith in hope to his inmates when he claims that his two weeks in solitary confinement were the ""easiest"" he'd ever done, all thanks to the music he kept in his head. He tells Red ""get busy living, or get busy dying"" and uses the death of Brooks as his evidence, much to Red's initial chagrin. Yes, Andy is built into an icon for hope in this movie, and that is what makes it so universally successful in its appeal. Hope can and should be adopted by every human being who graces the earth. This notion is expressed through Andy's entire struggle, as well as in Thomas Newman's incredible musical score for the film (which is so good it has been used in multiple movie trailers before to evoke emotional response). This precious lesson, told through a film in which literally everything is perfectly mastered, is what makes The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films ever made."	10
 The best prison film ever made.		9
 Excellent Movie	Probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Its one of those movies where you just sit and reflect for a while after the final credits roll. Great plot, script, and acting. One of the best ever made. When Andy escaped at the end and screwed the warden over, my gosh, it does not get any better than that. It also has one of those twists in it where you think that one thing is going to happen and the completely opposite does. Near the end, when everyone thought that Andy was going to commit suicide and we all thought that he was going to be in the cell dead, he was gone, vanished. When the warden revealed the whole in the wall hidden by the poster I don't remember felling better for the outcome of a movie than I did at the end of this film.	10
 Thought-provoking, greatest film of all time....	Shawshank Redemtion is the best film I've ever seen, I personally think that they should make so many more unforgettable films like this elsewhere in the world. Overall this inspirational motion picture is definitely out of this world. In my opinion this Movie is thought-provoking and it touches your sole in many ways.Andy Dufresne who was unlawfully sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, became great friends with 'Red' a convict who was an influential inmate inside the Shawshank prison, they became a surprising partnership inside Shawshank prison Night after night, day after day, Andy tried to adapt to prison life, however he realised he shouldn't be in this indescribable road to hell so thats where his plans begin....	10
 What a movie !! A little hope can push you forward ..		10
 One of the Greatest Cinema		10
 Jeff Schrembs review Shawshank Redemption	This movie, in spite of several violent scenes, is well acted and has a great plot line. The casting is excellent and the movie has moments of brilliance and is overall an excellent movie. The ending is satisfying and even though the characters are prisoners they have an air of honesty and a desire to simply (a) accept responsibility for their crime and (b) to be able to live a life of peace and pursue happiness. Far too many times, in movies and on TV, men in prison are shown to be soulless/corrupt/violent/without redeeming qualities and yet our prisons are FULL of people who are INNOCENT of the crimes they are in prison for and the cops/prosecutors are NOT always right and they are, in many cases, as corrupt as the worst offenders. This movie is a classic and has withstood the test of time. Take care and may God bless you.	10
 The greatest film in existence - The Shawshank Redemption.	The Shawshank Redemption, is without a doubt the greatest film the world has ever come across. From the moment i sat down to watch this, the mutual hype made me sceptical whether it will live up to my expectations, but it could not have blown me away any more than it did. Tim Robbins takes the leading role and in my opinion couldn't have done a better job, along with Morgan Freeman who delivered a fine supporting role. The compelling storyline, directing, casting and more importantly, acting throughout the cast made this my favourite film ever. I gave it 10 out of 10 because of this and out of the hundreds of films i have rated, it was the only one with a perfect score. This film is about as 'must watch' as it gets, and anyone who hasn't must do so right away otherwise they are severely missing out.	10
 the shawshank redemption is epic	"hi i'm 14 years old and this movie is my favourite film of all time. everything about it is stunning, the set, the characters, the acting, the story, the directing, the writing, the music - everything was fantastic and complemented the point of the film.everyttime i watch it, i seem to feel cleansed and happy. a whole lot of people would just say that it is a depressing and boring movie, but when you watch it and understand the plot and watch it through to the end the ""redemption"" makes you feel ""redeemed"".while i probably enjoy a casual simple movie (whether comedy or action etc...) on a rainy day this movie is definitely my favourite. i strongly recommend this to anyone looking for an inspirational (although i'll admit it is a bit weird to be inspired by convicted felons) movie with clever twists and ingenuity. a 10/10 for me"	10
 Hope Sets you Free	This is now the 2,340th Review of this Title. However, I'm still writing it because this movie deserves to be written about. It really exceeds the 10/10 scale. An awe-inspiring story of hope, this is just one of those movies that you know you still want to watch in 20 years. The movie premise itself at first sight doesn't seem like it will be all that interesting. However, from the first minutes, you realize the superior writing, acting and cinematography unrivaled I would say by any other film I've seen. Throughout the movie, I find myself constantly connected to the characters, wishing that the warden would overcome his cold-hearted nature and concede to let our antagonist, Andy free from the torment that was The Shawshank Prison. I almost let out an audible sob when Tommy was shot. If you're looking for something to bring you up, to give you hope, you've come to the right place. This movie is probably the most soul-touching piece of two and half hour film out there, encompassing friendship, suffering, hope, and freedom. This movie is really what I believe that this should serve as the model for Hollywood. It's about time that they learn that for a movie to be good, it doesn't need excessive gore, or explosions on screen, or special effects, or sex scenes or any of what comes with the modern-day Hollywood production. This movie is pretty simple. Just men talking. If you haven't seen this movie yet, now the #1 movie on the IMDb leader boards, you don't know what you're missing. A must see for anybody and everybody of age. (10/10)	10
 A brutal, yet astonishing film that remains believable in every aspect...		10
 Magnificent	Can a man find redemption if he truly repents for the crimes he'd committed? Can the human spirit triumph even in the darkest of places, like a prison? Is hope a dangerous thing? These are the questions you will be asking yourself after watching this Fillet Mignon of a film masterpiece. Based on the incredible writer Stephen King and directed by the diamond in the rough film director Frank Darabont, the Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest movies of all time, in my opinion. It's one of those movies that whenever it is on TV, I can't help but watch it from start to finish.The story is narrated by the soothing voice of Morgan Freeman, named Red. And he tells us of the time a new prisoner, Andy a former bank executive convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, came to the Shawshank Pennitentary. At first, Andy has a tough time adjusting to prison life, even getting beaten up a few times by the fellow thugs. But soon he finds his place doing the taxes of all the guards and the warden.There are so many good things about this film, I can barely think of all of them. The story in which it was based was indeed an enthralling one, Frank Darabont directed it and did a great job, not to mention the grade-A casting.I'm not sure what the main theme of this movie is, but if I had to guess, it would be about hope. And that hope cannot escape anyone, even those in positions where they feel like there is none. And that redemption is available for any man.I rate this movie a 10. I never considered giving it anything less.	10
 Movies cant be more engrossing than this...		10
 A truly hymn of life !!!	Some people say that cinema art has one purpose. Awake all our senses and lead us to it's own paths ..,well this movie does it very well ...is Art!!!!.... It's a picture about friendship , the value of life and the importance of education ..... the point its to be free wherever you are....some people are not in prison but live in fear for everyday difficulties and lose all the courage they have about life but our characters have the strength to feel free inside and catch their dream outside the prison. This movie directed perfectly !!!! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman saw to us their tremendous talent !!! . A must see !!! p.s : is the best movie i have ever seen !!!	10
 Nothing short of classic	"The Shawshank Redemption is a true classic film of the 90's imagined by the great mind of Stephen King and stars two amazing actors, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.The story is one of hope and misfortune. The main character Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is accused of a murder for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. After a very unfair trail he is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison. During his stay at Shawshank he befriends Ellis Redding (Morgan Freeman) who helps him on his journey of escaping the prison. The course of the movie shows the classic dark idea of life in a corrupt prison. Warden Norton is that Warden that you just can't trust and one that is on a power-trip crusade throughout the movie. The inmates of Shawshank all have a different story and Morgan's character Ellis explains how over-time, the inmates become institutionalized and have a hard time functioning outside of the prison as it's all they have known.It doesn't take long for Andy Dufresne to come up with a escape plan. Towards the beginning of the film Ellis helps him to get carving tools to ""carve chess pieces,"" but over time actually carves a tunnel through his cell wall and keeps it hidden with posters of super models over the years. Throughout Andy's stay in Shawshank he forms a close bond with Ellis and he tells him when he gets out to go to this place and look under a stone. You won't find out why until the end of the film.Despite it being written by Stephen King the ending is actually a happy ending. Not quite sappy but a good ending and a ending that seems well deserved. It's amazing how Shawshank Redemption took a relatively simple idea and turned it into a classic. The old cliché of digging your way out of prison by tunnel and being unjustly accused for a murder in a time where there was no such thing as forensic science actually happen quite a bit in those days, but the way it was imagined and executed in this movie is just classic and one for the ages."	
 An imprisoned banker finds hope in the least expected place	I've watched a number of movies during the years. I'm not sure whether that number is north of 500 but it's definitely close. No other movie has had the effect that Shawshank Redemption has on me every time I watch it.The movie describes the years in prison of Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins), a banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife. There he meets Red(Morgan Freeman), another convicted felon, who -like most movies featuring Morgan Freeman- is also the narrator of the movie.Throughout his years in prison, we watch Andy go from some prisoners' boxing bag, to prison's librarian, to prison guards' personal banker. We experience with him the pain, the frustration, the sorrow. Tim Robbins gives a magnificent performance opposite Morgan Freeman's Red, maybe the only role outshining Mandela in Invictus. I won't bother you with technical details about direction, cinematography and art direction. The All-Time Best Movie place here in IMDb is by it's own a testament of the excellence that is the Shawshank Redemption. Few (if any) movies will provide the viewer with such a feeling of catharsis by the end. I hope I haven't spoiled it. If you haven't already watched this masterpiece of a movie, rush to the nearest DVD store. Every human being able of watching a movie should watch this movie at least once.Cheers	10
 A Great Movie about Hope	From the intro setting up the mood for the 1940s with If I didn't Care that strangely feels like Bioshock or Fallout from the other era defining themes such as the relevance of Rita Haywood from the 50s to Tommy Williams emulating the James Dean Rock' n Roll character to set the mood of the 60s. This is something that has not been addressed when reviewing this movie, how it seamlessly transfer from era to era is genius in itself. The camaraderie between Andy and Red is flawless and the viewer truly believes that these two are the leaders of Shawshank and are the best of friends. By leaders, just look at the scene where Heywood is about to be slit by Brooks and Andy and Red are notified right away to solve the problem; great scene symbolizing their importance to the group. The only flaw which keeps it from being a perfect 10 out 10 movie is that it suffers from the same stereotype that prison movies are littered with, and that is the inclusion of sodomites. I know that's what happens in prisons, but is just disgusting and cringe worthy seeing this on screen; however Shawshank Redemption implies what the Sisters do to Andy and never graphically show it on screen and that is the saving grace. That is why it only loses one point and not several, anyhow. The movie's message about hope is more heavily implied near the end though, how Andy never loses hope while Red is closer to being institutionalized. The line get busy living or get busy dying always sends chills down my spine because of its relevance when Andy says it when he knows that the system is absolutely corrupt when his only witness that could get him a new trial is killed so that Andy could keep laundering money for the warden.	9
 An excellent film!	This movie is one of the best movies ever made. I remember when i was watching it. I was feeling during the movie every emotion that you can imagine. The cast, well you know the cast... they play their roles with outstanding performance. The movie has some moments of awesomeness. Its great. Its perfect. Scenes, photography, scenario, plot, things that keeps your attention with intensity (and its not an action film), it has everything. I recommend it without hesitation. An excellent masterpiece that surely will be remembered as one of the greatest films ever. If you haven't watched this one yet, do it. Stop reading this review and go watch that movie!	10
 Be ordinary - watch the movie - stay inspired		10
 great movie	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced life in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover although he was not guilty of either one of the crimes. Sent to Shawshank Prison to do hard time, Andy, a banker has to learn to live life inside the prison's walls. He befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) while they both embark on a journey that reveals many things about themselves as well as each other. This is hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. It is a story about two men who withstand decades of harsh prison life while exposing the buoyancy of the human spirit. The movie reveals the significance of dignity and formality and also how knowledge and confidence can go a long way and ultimately be a way to survival. It explores the depths of friendship, forgiveness, and freedom.	10
 some things are better left unsaid, but i can't hold it on	The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film with a perfect cast and a wise plot. It had its good times, had entertainment and lead us to some reflections about life. Sadly it had some predictable conversations and seemed to be just another Morgan Freeman's movie. It dares to almost offend our intelligence the fact that the prison officers didn't check that poster carefully one single time in twenty years. And I have two questions: was the American justice that weak back in 1994? Were the condemned all smart and good people as this movie portrayed?If it deserves to be at 1st spot here? Maybe. If it became one of my favorite movies? No, just a good watch.	7
 fantastic	"This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The only movie that can compete with this, in my opinion, is Forrest Gump. This movie is absolutely fantastic. If you have not seen this movie, stop reading now, and watch it. It has some of the best plot twists of any movie I ever saw (spoilers), the biggest one perhaps being when they really make it seem like Andy killed himself, but then it is revealed that he escaped. That was the biggest ""whoa"" moment for me and it continued by showing exactly how almost everything he had done over the past 19 years was a part of his elaborate escape plan. I can guarantee this will be one of your favorites as soon as you finish watching it, that's what happened for me. I love this movie, and I could watch it again and again. This movie definitely deserves to be number one on IMDb, and I have no idea why it isn't as highly praised by the critics as it is by normal people. But that seems to happen a lot, doesn't it?"	10
 He starts to get both other prisoners and guards on his side when he offers to help one of the most	He starts to get both other prisoners and guards on his side when he offers to help one of the most notorious guards with a tax problem in exchange for bottles of chilled beer for everyone in his work party. From then on, Andy always seems to be working on one thing or another. He improves the prison's tiny library, and helps those prisoners who want to study. He also handles the guards' tax returns, and even helps the swindling Warden (Bob Gunton) cook the books. Over the years, he gains the respect of most of the other prisoners and guards. More importantly, he never loses hope for the future – a hope he tries to pass on to the other prisoners. He never stops believing in life's possibilities, but to make the most of them he needs to be free.	10
 The -prison-drama-movie- you are going to WATCH & feel & enjoy even if do not like prison life movies	Competitor: Forrest Gump & Pulp Fiction. . The story sets in 1940's, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, for the murder of his wife and her lover. . Morgan Freeman is Ellis Boyd also known as Red, plays a fantastic role that makes the movie even more impressive. Befriends Andy in prison and then the 'adventure' begins... . This movie will keep you thrilled and excited, you would not want to miss anything. Anything that bothers me about this movie is THE ENDING. I do not want to spoil anything here but you should know that this kinda ending is predictable and somehow raises questions about the characters sex life. I am just saying. . . . AND YES I AGREE THIS MOVIE SHOULD NOT BE NUMBER ONE IN THE IMDb TOP 250. THIS MOVIE IS GREAT BUT NOT THE BEST!!! NOT THAT I WANT TO DISCOURAGE YOU FROM WATCHING IT! GO AHEAD WATCH IT AND LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU THINK. . P.S. DO NOT just watch one movie and judge the rest...watch them all!! ' My rating: [8.5/10]	9
 The Greatest Film Of All Time	What more can be said about this film? It was a short story given a big budget but flopped at the box office, likely thought of as just another prison film. Then people began watching copies and by word-of-mouth the characters, the plot, the sheer brilliance of the story grew so as it became almost legend.Gripping, harrowing, horrific, and finally uplifting due to its totally unexpected ending you may well find yourself appalled, laughing, sad, angry and finally even shed some tears whilst watching this intelligent and moving film. The ending is exceptional.A cinematic masterpiece, now enhanced by being available on BluRay and well worth obtaining.	10
 37927	"In my book, 37927=24601. Both incredibly important numbers that happen to be the prison numbers for both Andy Dufresne and Jean Val Jean, respectively.Greatest movie ever made. A movie that makes you want to be a better person. No movie has ever matched it, and no movie ever will.To quote Red: ""I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope. """	10
 A Classic	This is a film that is heavy on character and dialogue and delivers on both. The performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are outstanding, as are each of the supporting actors. This film was adapted from a short story, 'Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption,' written by Stephen King. Perhaps it is because it's adapted from a short story as to why this works so well as there are only minor changes and nothing essential is left out, leaving the film makers with the ability to strengthen and stretch out the main focus, which is the bond created by the two main characters. In my personal opinion I would say this film is one of the most successful book to script adaptations in film history. The direction is brilliant in the way it is almost not noticeable as it relies on the actors and their interactions with each other to keep the audience interested. Cinematography is worth a mention also as each shot is captured beautifully. In summary, Shawshank is a must see and a well deserved film classic.	10
 Definitely one of the Greatest Movies Ever.....		10
 Shawshank takes you through many emotions.	Morgan Freeman is fantastic in this film as he guides Tim Robbins through his 20+ years at Shawshank Prison. This movie takes you through many different emotions. Everything that takes place in the prison makes me definitely not want to ever go to prison! Tim Robbins gives a superb performance as Andy Dufrense an innocent man sent to a very vengeful prison. If you have never seen this film, you will be amazed by everything that happens. Great ending by the way.The warden played by Bob Gunton is the perfect 2-faced bible-toting, under the counter dealing bad-guy in a position of power over others. Somehow this movie summed up life over the last fifty or so years looking back on who was in power running the country and big business.	10
 Life-changing, life-affirming		10
 Speechless	"""You know the funny thing is, outside, I was an honest man. I had to get into prison to become a crook"" It is lines like this, that can effortlessly just make me shut my mouth, and marvel at this work of art. Morgan Freeman plays by far the most under-appreciated supporting roles in film history, and deserved the Oscar in my opinion (just watch the fifteen minutes after his prison sentence, particularly in the end, at Buxton, (I am being very subtle so I don't spoil anything!) and you will know what I am talking about). Take nothing away from Tim Robbins; sometimes, that one acting performance defines a legend. And honestly, if you are reading this review without having watched the movie yet, ...well, Go get it!! As far as rating goes, I would say ""Let all other ratings be relative to Shawshank""!"	10
" ""This is Hope,in its Best"""	"""Most of the reviews would contain..""the best movie ever"", but that doesn't matter, what matters more is 'hope', hope for this movie to be different than rest of the movies..and i'am sure that after watching this masterpiece, you would sit and smile for a moment and the narration of Morgan Freeman would be in your minds for a long long time. Some movies such as the 'Shawshank Redemption' can possibly change your way of doing..at first while watching the trailer and the rest, you would begin to think that this movie has no action, comedy or whatsoever that would interest you, but the most interesting part of the movie is the 'movie itself'. The plot, the story, the acting, characters and everything would surely blow your mind and every time you watch this movie, you would feel more good and faith. In a nutshell, one of the best movie ever made and a must watch for all of us.."""	10
 Touching, heartwarming yet powerful! One of the greatest films ever and one of the greatest novel adaptations ever.		8
 A must for your DVD collection		10
 Really good movie, but a bit over rated	This movie for me was a really great drama. Although some people would act as though this freaking movie was genius, which in my opinion is a little bit over rated. Tim Robbins does do a great job in seeming as though hes just a good guy, and morgan freeman, well hes just morgan freeman in another role. The movie is a tad bit long and the action is none. But the acting is great and the ending is to pretty great. I liked this movie a lot but I did not finish this movie thinking that it was one of the best films of all time, like I was led to believe. All in all it was a great film that I give an 8 or just below that, like a 7.9. So as long as you got the bong out and some munchies and your not a punk kid with A.D.D. which by the way I have myself. You should definitely like this one. Two Blunts up.	8
 Simply one of the best movies ever !	"This is, by far, one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's simply moving. Incredbly perfect in all the aspects. The story is unbelievable, with great actors and a director who really knew how to make the story work.Andy Dufresne really got the bad luck when he was incriminated for the murder of his wife and her lover. He had all the clues against him, and not a really convincing alibi. He made some friends in the prison, including his best friend, the guy who could get things(""Red""), and the director of the prison. Using his experience as a former banker, he helped the director of the prison to make lots of money corruptly.He helped the director in exchange for some favors. But the director didn't helped him when he most needed him, and, to make it worse, he killed the only witness who knew the guy that had really killed Andy's wife and her lover.What anybody expected is the end of this story, which I wont give away. I can only say that the hope Andy had for things to work out had materialized, and the good guys lived happy forever.Masterpiece."	9
 Masterpiece!!!	This is one of the few films to which I had such an initial reaction. Most films are not truly appreciated until a second viewing, however I was blown away by this film and it still stands as one of my favorite films of all time. The central relationship of Andy and 'Red' is one of the main reasons why this film is so good. I don't understand how anyone could find this disappointing. The cast was perfect, especially Tim Robbins who I feel didn't get enough credit for his role as Andy. Morgan Freeman, who was also terrific got most of the praise for his role. Without knocking him, I feel that Tim Robbins was the star of the film and his character was completely believable. All of actors did a great job and you feel emotionally engaged with them in contrast with many Hollywood 'Blockbusters' who are like robots!	10

 I loved this movie	Last year on my birthday about six friends and I went to an Italian restaurant and had some wine and pizza. We started playing a game where everyone had to say their five favorite movies. Every single person listed Shawshank Redemption as one of their favorite movies. One person a was a lawyer, one a banker, one a physical therapist, one a writer, and one an actress and they all love the movie. Why is this? What is it about Shawshank Redemption that is so widely loved? I think it's because of the friendship between Andy and Red, for one. For another, you really care for Andy and root for him to get out, and then he surprises you with his gentleness and ingenuity. For another, the music is wonderful. For another, I think the movie is about humanity, really. How do we keep our humanity amidst terrible inhumanity? Through art, through music, through appreciation of beauty as well as love for mankind.	10
 Carl the Critic: The Shawshank Redemption	"OH MY GOD!!! Such an amazing film! It's nice to know that Stephen King can do more than stories about Evil Spirits killing things. This film is perhaps on of the greatest films ever made! It is a movie about truth, justice, bravery, and prison rape (what more can one ask for!) Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make a perfect match for this film, and despite one or two moments of slow tension between Robbins and everyone else in the film, it is very deep, powerful,thought provoking, jaw dropping, eyes widening, and spine chilling from beginning to end. The only thing I don't understand is ""WHERE ARE THE WOMEN!?"" This film is 99.9999999...9999% men and only 0.0000000...0001% women (at the very beginning having sex) but that is seriously the only complaint one can make about this film, other than the fact that it is long and depressing. The ending is down right perfect, and I had found myself in awe when I saw Andy (Tim Robbins) crawl through a 500 yard sewage pipe only to come out the other side a free man. What makes me curious about the film is why haven't people noticed that he was carving a hole behind the posters? He had changed them occasionally, there must have been some time when someone walked by and noticed a hole in the wall. The film's realism sucks you in like a vacuum cleaner to the point where you feel like you are a prisoner in Shawshank just chilling with Freeman and the gang of prisoner who bet on which prisoner is gonna cry first."	10
 Unforgettable!		10
 A Must Watch		9
 Beautiful..		10
 An unforgettable movie	The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best movies ever made.It is a simple yet powerful story that really touches your heart. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that the director does not use anything flashy to entice the viewers in this movie. The music by Thomas Newman adds depth and character to the movie and certainly enhances the overall appeal of the movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman prove that good acting trumps over everything else. Frank Darabont also deserves a lot of credit for his direction. It does not feel that this is his first movie. The cinematography of this movie is also excellent and Roger Deakins has done a wonderful job. The biggest strength of this movie is that it tells us to be brave in adverse times and not lose hope even in bad times. We can learn a valuable lesson from this movie and also realize the value of patience. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me and most of the people will love to see The Shawshank Redemption again.	9
 Hope is a Good Thing		10
 Stephen King Is Legend	The Shawshank Redemption is simply one of the most emotionally strong movies made, Even Though it's not Divine, But The movie is still very powerful and interesting. The Cast is very Strong and Believable. Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red are just perfect.Bob Gunton as Warden Norton also did a great job. Like most of the movies created from Stephen Kings creativity this too is a great piece of gem. The Direction is one of the strongest of the 90s and the movie itself is has become the pride of the 90s era. All though the movie has many flaws but they are not really noticeable and does not really bother you. The movie is not the greatest you will see, but i can assure that its a movie worth watching for sure.	7
 A movie about hope	"When I was seen the movie at the first time, I didn't really get the message of the movie. It's was so slow, but it didn't put me to sleep. I didn't know how the whole story would go to an end. I still able to enjoy it. I made myself to see it again, and finally I understood why it had so hight rate on IMDb. The movie started with Andy. A bank director, whom was sued for killed his wife and a man. Police fought exhibit to charge him for committed a murder. Andy was sent to jail for lifetime. In prison Andy met Red and they learned each other and became friendly. Red was a black man. He had been in prison almost 20 years at the time Andy came.Inside Andy always wanted to free himself out of the prison. It wasn't him, whom committed that horrible murder. I fell sorry for Andy. He paid his life for someone else, but nobody believed, he was innocently. What I was so surprised, Andy on the first time at the prison had planned to get out. Hope always inside him. That gave him strong to keep his plan to 20 years. And finally he was out of the prison.Red was different. He admitted, he was a murder when he was young. He apologised for what he did and wished to be a free man just like a bird. But every time he had a conversation with the whole manager, he always got denied. It's made him to feel hopeless. At the last time Red almost gave up all the hope. He didn't want to waste his time anymore. His speech was so amazing, fully emotion. Red just wished to go back at the time when he committed a horrible crime. He wanted to tell the kid, that what he did was so wrong. But he coundn't, he didn't have a miracle to do so. This time he got approved.What I learned about this movie was Hope and Friendship. Like Andy said ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of thing, and no good thing ever died"". He right, if we gave up hope, would we have a future?"	10
 this is a classic	this is one of Steven kings greatest movies ever i have watched this over 50 times in the last 15 years i know that Steven king is well known for his horror movies i would say that even though this is not a horror it is better than all of his horror movies. i am a big fan of Steven king so i am Rather amazed by the way he did the shaw-shank, at first i did not think that it was a Steven king movie but when i got a box set of Steven king movie for my 15th birthday an saw that it was in there i realised why it was so good i would recommend this to any1. but as a huge movie buff i watch a lot of movies.i became a big fan of Steven king when i saw Carrie. i think that Steven king has a great imagination and also puts a lot of effort into his work. the shaw-shank was a masterpiece for the way he bet raid the warden as a sadistic person. the way he used Andy as a smart but cunning inmate was amazing.	10
 Classic and Unforgettable Movie		10
 excellent		8
 great great movie	I only watched this movie a week ago and it is already won of my favorite movies. And Stephen king is my favorite writer and this is one of if not the best stories he ever wrote. And it was not even a novel it was one of the stories in different seasons as well as stand by me and apt pupil. my favorite quotation is Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass it is a funny quotation. I would recommend this movie to all of my friends and family.10 out of ten for this movie. I wanted to watch it over and over again. So this is my first review so i think i made a good choice for my first review. angry ants first review.	10
 A moving story	The Shawshank Redemption begins with the hero of this story, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) being convicted of murder, and sent to Shawshank prison. While there Andy meets a man who is a very longtime convict, named Red (Morgan Freeman). With the help of his new friend, Andy will change Shawshank prison in a way that no one will see coming.I was absolutely shocked when I first saw this movie. At first I had no idea what to even say about it I thought it was so good. The Shawshank Redemption is in my opinion not only one of my favorite films of all time, but one of the greatest of all time. Tim Robbins delivers one of the best performances of his career, and was probably deserving of an Oscar nomination, along with Morgan Freeman who had an amazingly powerful performance as well. Overall The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite, if not my favorite, movies of all time. It is what I believe to be Frank Darabont's masterpiece.	10
 An Amazing Movie... The Greatest? I'm not too sure	"I want to start out by letting everyone know: I read Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption first, this may change the views I have towards the film (though not by much, but we'll get to that later).Shawshank Redemption is by far the best emotional roller-coaster that I've ever been on. I laughed some, I cried some, and I felt a genuine love for the characters and their struggle. In some ways, I want to say this is the greatest film ever but then I think about it, it's not the greatest film. There is a lot about it that makes it fantastic, some elements have the potential to be ""The greatest"". Here's the thing though: it's not the greatest movie I've ever seen, I just can't find anything that I dislike about it. This may not make a whole lot of sense, but think of it this way: for a very long time my favorite movie was Pulp Fiction (Tarantino), the raw feeling I got after watching Pulp was so new to me that I couldn't help but stand up and say ""That was the greatest movie I've ever seen."" Immediately my friend disagreed with me, but Pulp just worked for me. I watched Shawshank with this same friend, and we had a discussion about how we felt about it. I didn't feel the raw emotion that I felt after Pulp, he agreed, but I also told him I thought it was excellent, he agreed. What he told me after that was: ""You know, I can see how it's the number 1 movie on IMDb, there's almost nothing to complain about, so there are fewer people who are going to hate it."" He was absolutely right, there's just nothing to complain about.Now to the cast: Robbins and Freeman play a fantastic duo, (Freeman was a great choice for Red, even though Red is described as Irish, for real, in the novella) and like always Freeman plays his best. I'm not too acquainted with Robbins, but he did everything right, and he made Andy Dufrense a likable, but mysterious and distant character that Dufrense is. Freeman plays Red fantastically, flat out amazing, the nonchalance and joking nature of Red is captured perfectly by Freeman. The rest of the cast does very well, especially James Whitmore, who plays Brooks, the oldest convict in Shawshank State Prison. His role is one of the few in all of history that's brought me to tears.Seeing how there's no action, there's not much to talk about in the effects department, so I'll move on, straight to the story. I have a theory that Stephen King is not a good writer, at least I don't think so, but he is a fantastic storyteller. Shawshank is no different, the plot unfolds well, few details are missed, and the pace is perfect: not too fast, not too slow. I think a lot of the credit there goes to Darabont though, he did a fantastic job bringing an often under looked Stephen King novella to life, and I have no complaints on his work.In my opinion there's not a whole lot to say regarding this film, it's fantastic, but you have to watch it to understand why. So, pick this one up, I think this a movie with a broad base, which is very hard to dislike, no matter if you turn your mind off and enjoy (it's still followable) or if you like to think about every detail. I highly recommend it."	10

 One man does not allow himself to be held down by fear but relies on hope	I would have to state that The Shawshank Redemption is my all time favorite movie. The cast of characters who were selected for the film fit their roles perfectly along with the plot and music. The Shawshank Redemption is sure to keep your attention. The message of the movie provides hope that will inspire and deeply move the viewer.The story is about a man who is wrongfully accused of a crime and is sentenced to life in prison. It is in prison where he meets an inmate that will eventually become his good friend for the remainder of his time. After suffering under the warden's tyranny for so many years Andy relies on hope to make a daring move. I would definitely recommend this movie to any viewer because it will not disappoint.	
 Great movie!	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie about two best friends finding hope in their condemned lives. Andy is a banker who was wrongly convicted of killing his wife. His wife was cheating on him and murdered during her affair. Andy befriends Red a fellow inmate. During their time in prison together they become best of friends. They work through their hardships together. Throughout their story this group of inmates lives an unordinary prison life. This is shown from drinking beer while tarring the roof to doing the officers taxes. This is a remarkable story of the ups and downs of prison life and the new people they become. Andy states that in his free life he was a law abiding man, but he had to come to jail to become a criminal. This is commented on when he begins laundering money for the warden. Towards the end the camera shows Andy slumped on the ground leaning up against the prison, which is very neat. This view is from far away up above and gives the feeling of Andy being rather small. This is an amazing angle as it helps show how he is confused about escaping because he will miss his friends. The lighting throughout this movie allows us to see everything appropriately, but helps to set the mood of each scene. This can be seen when Andy is in the movie room about to be attacked the lighting is very dark. This is just one example of the many great lighting choices. This has been my favorite movie for a long time. This movie allows the viewer to look into the men's hearts and minds. Perhaps one of the classic themes to this movie is the narration throughout the movie that is performed by Morgan Freeman. I believe it is clear how great this movie is as it is ranked #1 on IMDb for all time movies. This movie will always be one of the greats, and will withstand the test of time.	10
 a great prison movie and very emotional	I recently saw this film at home and was hooked right into the movie. The Shaw shank Redemption was one of the greatest movies i have ever seen and i am glad they did not make a sequel or it probably would have been a let down. this was very emotional and some scenes are hard to watch such has the raping scenes but also there was a lot of emotion between Andy Dufresne and red becoming friends and trying to live in this prison.it was very realistic in how prison life is hard and what it does to you after so many years. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great in there roles. the ending where red goes and meets Andy in Mexico on the boat made the movie even better because it does not leave me with a feeling of emotional and sad feeling but emotional and happy feeling of friends meeting up again after a period of time and after going threw so much in prison. this movie was great and i recommend it to every one who likes to watch good films. my rating: 10/10.	10
 One Movie to rule them all	It's no surprise as to why this film tops the list. Morgan Freeman gives the performance of a lifetime and everyone will agree that he was robbed of a lot of awards that he deserved. Frank Darabont took a huge risk in putting a well used and clichéd idea to the screen and did what no director could ever do. He made the movie better than the book.I first watched the shawshank redemption in 2004 (10 years after it first came out) and remember myself being so intrigued and moved by a movie. I have never felt this much enthusiasm about a film before. It is without a doubt, the best motion picture of all time and if had been released now instead of 1994 I reckon it could have beaten Avatar and The hurt locker at the Oscars.10 out of 10 for the movie, the director and the actors who gave heartbreaking and moving performances, my hat goes off to them.	10
 I saw it out of sheer boredom..but never regretted later	"I had seen this movie quite a few years back, but still i vividly remember each and every dialogue,every character,every scene and even the background theme associated with every scene .The very name ""shawshank"" sends a chill down my spine.I was so deeply moved by the movie that it made my eyes feel watery for almost a week.The haunting soundtrack kept on lingering on mind and my urge to watch the movie resurfaced every now and then.***Spoilers ahead*** It's a poignant tale of an innocent man (banker) wrongfully convicted for committing a crime of passion (killing his wife and her lover).When he is sent to jail (Shawshank prison)for the aforementioned reason,he develops a special bond with a jail mate ""Red"" ( played by Morgan Freeman) supposedly the only guilty one at Shawshank.During his time in prison he comes across many harsh realities such as the dull eerie life in prison,the atrocities on prisoners and most importantly the real culprit behind the crime (the one who actually killed his wife).To exact his revenge he develops a master plan using his banking knowledge and outwits the jail guards by a surreptitious escape from prison to lead a new life in another part of the world.The movie scores in following aspects Dialogue:Witty , memorablejust simply great..and yeah not to mention the smart,strong and powerful narration by Morgan Freeman.Character formation:Every character carried some background information.Background score:That's the USP of this film..The background theme during the scene where Andy dufresne is brought into the Shawshank prison and the camera rolls high above the prison is just so mesmerizing.Acting: Top notch acting by the lead actors and backed well by the support cast.Story: Powerful,thought-provoking,tear-shedding and most importantly not a clichéd one.To sum up this movie gives a powerful message of hope and redemption .something we all seek in life."	9
 A fascinating experience	The movie of a lifetime. I'm not going to compare it with the Forrest Gump or the Godfather series, but this movie stands out saying 'I'm the One!'.Remarkably perfect screenplay, wonderful dialogues and an unmatched cast, this movie takes you to a journey through a life of a prisoner. You never get bored of the movie even for a split-second though the movie goes beyond 2 and a half hours if I remember. You realize what it is to be a prisoner and its horrible after effects and the deferment of human rights there. Perhaps you may have committed a crime, but that surely makes you think twice before you commit a mistake/crime.Unmatchable cinematography and this movie indeed sets a benchmark for the ones to follow!	9
 Superb!!!	First, the Shawshank Redemption has been my favorite movie ever since I saw it for the first time a few years after its initial release. I know I have seen it more than 50 times and it never gets old. The film is a heart-wrenching tale of a falsely accused man forced to do a life term in prison due to an ironic twist of fate. Along the way, Andy makes friends amongst his fellow prison mates; as well as some friends in higher places. These friendships greatly influence the plot and outcome of the story. The film has a dark side, too as the brutalities of everyday prison life come to the forefront. Also, the film possesses a lighter side with its portrayal of hope and faith and how those traits can rise out of desperation. This film is a must see, and anyone who watches it will undoubtedly laugh, cry, and wonder as they follow the trials and tribulations of Andy Defresne and his close circle of friends as they experience life behind bars inside the deep, dark, and dank Shawshank Prison.	10
 Without The Shawshank Redemption, which can be called best?!	"Without The Shawshank Redemption, which can be called best?! These day, i check in every day in time with my suit, and live a peaceful life. some day, i feel not good, i need refresh my soul, i need bring some light into my heart. so i get The Shawshank Redemption and watch it. It has been 15 years after Frank Darabont made The Shawshank Redemption this greatest movie until now. It says:""the greatest makes every one feel in the same greatest way"",The Shawshank Redemption is something like this. When some one got be sentenced to spend his rest entire life in the prison, the more hope he carries, the more dangerous he is. but Andy told Red, hope is good, and goodness never die. so Andy can hold his hope and dig the tunnel to out of Shawshank, when he finally crosses the tunnel, and shout aloud under the rain. the faith of hope breaks every nest."	10
 A fantastic piece of film making that stands the test of time.		9
 Why it's the best movie of all time	Having seen this movie several years ago, I decided to rent it again since I couldn't totally recall the movie. And yes, it being number 1 on the top 250 list made me want to see it again. I decided to go into the movie as if i hadn't seen it before to completely enjoy every aspect of it. The first thing I noticed was its amazing story, and even better, its gripping tale that hooks you from the very beginning. Tim Robbins (Andy) and Morgan Freeman (Red) give superb performances. I would go as far as to say that Shawshank is Freeman's best movie (besides Seven). The plot is amazing, with many sub-plots and twists that keep you from doing anything else. And the best part: the ending of the movie. I don't want to give away anything about it, but I'll just say that it rivals the ending of The Usual Suspects in every possible way. All in all, great story, great acting, great plot, awesome ending. What else could you want in a movie? 10/10 and nothing short of the best movie of all time.	10
 Best movie on my personal list	Yep I have to agree with so many others. I am a movie fan who usually watches about 5 a week on average. I actually keep track of every movie I watch in my own personal data sheet. This one is at the very top of my list.No movie I know of has better character development than The Shawshank Redemption. The movie has a few challenging scenes but most of it has a relaxed, even attractive quality to it. Just about anything Morgan Freeman does is good for me. I just can't help but like that man.I too thought this was Tim Robins' best role.I enjoyed the revenge component and somewhat happy ending even though it may have been a bit of a stretch.Great stuff. Good movie making. Good story writing. Great screenplay. Cinematography was appropriate. I felt like I was there with them.	10
 GRAND! No Big Spoilers	"Small failures can't stop this movie from being grand, moving and very well made. In it's first, and elegants scenes, we see Andy Dufresne finding his wife and her lover dead, and then Andy being falsely Accused of murder and sentenced to prison. This first scenes although great, are not very important to the movie, because the movie does not turns around Andy's false accusation (We know that since the beginning), it's about what he learns and teaches inside the prison. Although Robbins's performance is not excellent, he gives the character an air of sadness, and in almost every scene of the picture, we can see through his expressions that he is always either angry because he is not supposed to be there, or upset because he can't find a way out of there. Despite the fact that this movie is not very original, and when I say that I'm remembering that it took a lot of elements from Don Siegel's ""Scape from Alcatraz"" (I mean, it can be coincidence, but don't you think that Brooks's raven is very is very similar in the story to the mouse of ""Scape from Alcatraz?), the movie covers it because it's always grabbing you on the screen , I mean, there wasn't a single moment in the whole movie that I thought was boring.Verdict: With a powerful moving story, charismatic characters (Especially Freeman's), this Excellent movie is a great study of agony and friendship."	10
 I don't think you can get any better than this	The Shawshank Redemption is one of those one in a million type of films. The story is simple; innocent man gets falsely accused of murdering his wife, goes to prison for 20 years, escapes. You can't get any simpler than that, but that is the beauty of it. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman had their best roles in this film, and without a doubt Oscar worthy. The twists and turns, confrontations, inspirations, and most of all, hope make The Shawshank Redemption one of the greatest films of all time. You can't help but smile at the end of the film, and maybe even shed a tear, but in any case The Shawshank Redemption is worth the watch over any other movie, and I encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to see it as soon as possible. There will never be another film like this, but nevertheless, Shawshank will never be forgotten and will go down in history as being the most uplifting film ever.	10
 You can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside.	"9.0Living in today's time, you might find yourself to be incredibly busy. Or you might find yourself to have nothing but time. Lots of time, and nothing to do. you might feel pressured in by tasks and responsibilities. Jobs, school, family, children, or other obligations/duties. You might feel like you want to escape, even if for a little bit. Even if for just 2 hours. So you head over to the theater. You can catch a 2 hour flick and for those 2 hours, take your mind off the day's and the next day's demands. It can be quite adventurous, if you're seeking that. Or even emotionally gratifying. Truth is, films, and other entertainment, offer escapism. And the producers and creators of these films know this. So, why watch a movie about imprisonment? You might find the subject interesting, if you're keeping in mind that you will most likely never go to prison. So why not watch from the outside, from the other side of the glass mirror. You're safe there, and the film on screen cannot hurt you. The villains or dangers on screen cannot attack you, let alone even perceive you. But the opposite is true. The creators of the films know you are there. You are the reason why the film exists. And they aim to affect you. They sometimes even aim to attack you. And they definitely can. Have you ever watched a movie that ""spoke to you"", made you feel something, maybe even made you cry? How could you cry over nonexistent people? How can these nonexistent people affect you? It's because films are a reflection of the world. This reflection, although often exaggerated (sometimes super exaggerated), strike a chord in you. And the music, or the movie, stays in your head. And in your heart.So, once again, why watch a movie about imprisonment? Why would you escape to a place where people want to escape from? You're going into it with the assumption that at the end, the villain is defeated (the villain being the prison), and the characters, which you've somehow come to relate to and care about in the brief hour or two that you've known them, triumph over the villain and escape danger. And admittedly, as exaggerated as that is, you need it. A person does not suffer for no reason. One does not fall to stay down. And besides, who's to say that life inside is not life at all?The Shawshank Redemption is a human tale. It is one of the most down to earth films I've ever seen. Human emotion, thought and spirit is painted onto the screen, while succeeding at using the medium of film for storytelling, resulting in a powerful and well composed movie. The human heart is exposed as a fragile, yet firm organ which endures pain, and even worse, sorrow. It is a pillar of integrity that continues to beat even when the spirit of the person is broken, and hope itself has been lost and forgotten about. However, while the story, pacing and performances will draw you in and not let you go with its stroke of humanity, the film also displays the human being at its worst. Complete disregard for the well being of others, lack of forgiveness and greed are personalities and behaviors that are exhibited in the film. The truth is, mankind is not fit for self judgment. This is exhibited by errors in trial and the need for juries and witnesses. However, it is also fact that the men serving life sentences, although some committed errors whilst in a certain drunken state of mind, are insane.Although there are many faces in The Shawshank Redemption, and some come as far as to redeem themselves a little bit from time to time, there is one character that is static throughout all the film: the prison. It is arguably the best character, giving the best performance as well. There are several shots in the film that display the prison, that are the best shots in the film. This is the core of the film. This is where the atmosphere and tone of the film shine through, albeit gloomy. I just wish that there were more shots of the prison throughout the film. But it is not the main character of the film. While it is a character that speaks to the audience, it is not a relatable character.The Shawshank Redemption is a fine, fine film. It unveils the human heart, and all the wonders and beauties that it is capable of. It also manages to show off the polarity of the human heart. How men are capable of not just ending life, but installing factors like misery, sorrow, and hopelessness in others. Why do we feel trapped at times? Who's keeping you in, and what are they keeping you from? The Shawshank Redemption is a film that will imprison you, and not let you go until it has affected you. And when it finally has affected you, it will set you free. Blue skies, green grass and white clouds are what surrounds us every day. Sometimes we spend too much time in ""the hole"", and forget what life is like out there. You may even get used to it, and find yourself feeling like you can't survive on the outside. You may find yourself living in fear out there. But the truth is, you can build brick walls around a man, impose limitations to his actions and goals, but a man is only trapped on the inside. And just like our character Andy Dufresne, we had to come to prison to become a crook. So, ""get busy living, or get busy dying."" And get busy watching The Shawshank Redemption."	9
 I love the movie because it portrays great characters!	"****Contains spoiler****I love the movie because it portrays great characters!As to my favorite character, Since all the characters in this movie are so unique and vivid, especially Red and Andy, I had been in a tough time to pick out my most favorite one. For God's sake, let me just elect Andy at random first and write about the others next time. I think that the attraction for Andy mainly comes from the diversity between his exterior and interior. I have got to tell you that just Andy's appearance can merely teach me a lesson, reminding me of a saying, ""never judge a book by its cover. "" I cannot describe it better than those who have met Andy, so let me quote some words from them：1. ""My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know. Like a closed book"". - Stated by Andy, himself""You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you."" -- Cited from the Judge who sentenced AndyTommy: ""What's he in here for anyway?"" Red: ""Murder."" Tommy: ""The hell, you say."" Red: ""You wouldn't think it to look at the guy."" -- Cited from the conversation between Tommy and Red (Red had contacted with Andy more than 30 years when he said that )The above quotes may show that Andy is a fierce , cruel man in the external appearance. While he is warm-hearted and even be ready to help out. Andy made the government to expend the library to educate far more prisoners. Besides he even help a couple of fellas to get their high school equivalency. 2. ""I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man."" --cited from RedAccording to Red's comment, Andy looks weak, while you can find out that he is pretty brave. In the prison, Andy had been targeted by a group of homosexual guys called The Sisters. nevertheless Andy never gave in to them, even though he was beaten to dead by The Sisters.3. Andy is an extremely intelligent person, who is a banker and educated man. He always know the way to survive. In the person, one cannot live on his own, he has to gang up with others. He bought the gang beers and get accustomed to the custom of prison. Andy get along with the guards even the warden as well by helping them to earn extra money by finding the tax-deductible part.4. ""He had a quiet way about him...a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled...like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place."" -- Cited from RedAndy is always in a clam mood and plans things to accomplish with a very rational and organized way. Although Andy is flesh and blood, he is still patience and can tolerate everything regardless of all the abuse and bully. He spent 20 whole years for his prison-break with no single shred of sign or evidence.5.Andy is the type of person who appreciates help and gives his brutal revenge to the bad and evil. Tit for tat is a great conclusion to his personality. He exploded the bribery and even murder crime that the warden had committed, a doomsday to the evil once and for all.Considering all the points above, that is why I appreciate the character Andy."	10
 Pure Artistic Genius **Spoiler**	"Words of praise can't do enough justice for this film. There's something about it where you could watch it over and over and over and know everything that's gonna happen and still be shocked, saddened, and amazed by it as if you saw it for the first time. It just screams perfection: perfect story, acting, themes that are greatly worked into it without being too obvious. Part of the reason this is one of my favorites, maybe even my overall favorite film, is that it touches on so many world-essential things that everyone can relate to: hope, faith, integrity, justice, and the will to live and survive to name a few. I was shocked when I learned that this didn't win any Oscars. Although I do love Forrest Gump (the big winner of '94 which beat Shawshank for pretty much everything it was nominated in) and think that Tom Hanks did a brilliant job as Forrest, I still feel that Shawshank was slightly better. Morgan Freeman delivers what might be the performance of his career. There's so much believability in that it's just amazing. Tim Robbins is probably the only man who could have played Andy so perfectly. His quiet demeanor evokes great wonder about him, much like how Roy Orbison is such a presence on-stage and he hardly even moves. But the thing to really marvel about Andy is his integrity and patience. Although his need to escape could have driven him insane, his hope and faith in justice and God kept him sane enough to patiently work out his escape for 19 years. That meeting between Red and Andy where they discuss hope has to be one of the greatest scenes in the whole movie, next to Andy's ""resurrection"" baptism in the rain and when he breaks the sewage pipe with the stone in sync with the lightning. This film is much like another favorite of mine ""Citizen Kane"" because when it first came out people didn't really understand it that well and didn't see the prophetic power in it the first time around. But nowadays we as viewers have realized the impact and power that Shawshank holds on everyone who sees it. Every time it rains now, I just have the urge to run outside, take my shirt off, and just feel the rain pour down on me. I've seen this film maybe 10 times by now, and I know that I'll never stop watching it until the day that I die."	10
 Stephen King's Masterpiece Comes To Life		9
 A Master Piece	I have watched this film a dozen times and every time its a new experience.Its like the old wine which only keeps getting better. Red(Morgan Freeman) is the soul of the movie.I regard this as his finest works after Unforgiven .Tim Robbins is at his best or should I say his best work of his career .How dint this Movie get an Oscar is hard to answer.The movie has the best dialogues,the lines have become legendary.

A masterpiece of a movie..10/10	10
 Timeless...moving...extraordinary!		10
 Best movie ever!	The Shawshank redemption is a great movie about a bank man that is innocent judged for murdering his wife, his the main character and his name is Andy Defresne. When he arrives to the Shawshank prison he is quite lonely but he soon gets friend with some other prisoners who is serving a long and hard sentence. There is only men at the Shawshank prison. The prison where the film takes place is in New England in the U.S.The film about Andy Defresne is, right now, the film that is the according to the people who have voted for the their favorite movie at IMDb.com. The well known author Stephen King has written the story.I would obvious the best movie I have ever seen. It's very thrilling and it happens things all the time, it's never boring to watch it. I think I have seen it three or fore times. It's never gets bad. I give the book 10 of 10 if I have to rate it.	10
 The greatest film of all time	"Great films stir emotions. They have an impact that lasts long beyond the trip to the cinema. They give you an opportunity to reflect on your life, to ponder on the moments and they can inspire. The often misnamed 'Shawshank Redemption' (Scrimshaw Reduction?) was a box office failure when it came out in the UK in 1995. It's a story about 2 men, in prison in the 1940s, 50s and 60s and what happens to them... and that sounds pretty dull. But actually there is a simple message to this film and that is that hope is a good thing and nothing good ever dies. It's about the harsh and violent injustices that beset the central character including one of my personal greatest fears – being locked up for something I didn't do. The enigmatic Andy Dufresne goes on a 20 year journey of triumph in the face of adversity – a metaphorical and literal crawl through **** There are some powerful messages at play: that we can all become institutionalised in jobs or relationships, but that if we stick with them and believe in ourselves we will get to where we are aiming in the end. My passion for this film is that it is about life changing friendships and bonds between men which we quite often find difficult to express. It leaves a lump in the throat every time. Having seen it with my girlfriend, I went to see it two days later with my best friend and when it came out on video I rented it and watched it with my dad. It's a life affirmation film and when I'm fed up it never fails to give me the reminder that ""sometimes it all comes down to a simple choice – get busy living or get busy dying."" In my humble opinion, this is the greatest film of all time."	10
 Unbelievably well crafted, one of the best of the 90's		9
 The Best Movie In A Long, Long Time.		10
 One of the best	Superb adaptation of Stephen King's story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It is very true to the story, with all its mood, plot twists and the bad guy you love to hate. Characterization is magnificent. I am not normally a Tim Robbins fan, but he does a near perfect job here. Very satisfying. Worth seeing many times. The scene with the music from the Marriage of Figaro is my favorite. The relationship between Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's characters grows into one of the most satisfying in fiction. As all great fiction does, this story and the movie of it make you question what is real, what is true, and what is important.	9
 Truly No.- 1	I was recommended this movie by a colleague in my previous office. It is needless to write this comment but i just want to be the 2207th person to write about this movie. The first half of the movie is slow. Still it is engaging and keeps you involved into its characters.You are likely to left enchanted and awed by Andy Dufresne's chicanery and intelligence. He's banker who has been framed in the murder of his wife and made to serve life imprisonment. But, will he escape? Of course !!! But, it's the manner and style of his escape that makes this movie truly one of its kind . No doubt this movie has retained No. 1 for a long time now. And, it may remain for the years and decades to come..	10
 The best feel good movie ever!	This is my first comment on IMDb,After watching the shawshank redemption for the 100th time it still gives me the same feeling as it did the first time i saw it!It makes you appreciate life that little bit more!Not many movies can do this but shawshank pulls it off every time.The storyline is excellent as are the two main actors.Tim Robbins who plays Andy Dufrane is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and is sent to shawshank prison for life.He meets Red played by Morgan freeman and the they become the best of friends while in prison.The main message of this movie is that of hope and friendship!It shows us that no matter what life throws in front of us if we stay positive and know things will work out in the end then they will!This movie also has the best ever ending with the musical score perfect!Remember,no good thing ever dies!	
 i am glad i watched this movie!!!	this film! i cant just figure out,but it has something that moves you from inside and you cant explain it,may it the lighting or the distinctive cast that makes this ordinary film EXTRAORDINARY.its a shame it lost all the academy awards ,.. the movie was overwhelming when it comes to the music that moulded the film into its right structure or the perfect script that makes it worth to compete with one the most brilliant films yet being a nun in the crowd! i am sure i will not watch this movie again but it sure is to leave a deep impact in my head that i will share with my grand children that there was a film i watched that moved me to my core that sure to certain able to compete with the greatest movies of their time!	9
 Just great, Simply great		10
 Wow.		10
 The Lighted Pathway		10
 Wonderful And Hopeful	This is an absolutely beautiful movie. I'm not so sure if it deserves to be the number one movie on IMDb, or how exactly it wound up there, but that aside I do really love it. You really feel for Andy and the rest of the prisoners in this movie. It's a shame to see the warden and prison guards having the power that they do over the inmates, especially since they are crooked, foul individuals.One great scene is that of Brooks after he is released. I can still remember the letter that he was narrating while it played out. Very nicely done. There are many memorable lines throughout this movie, many of which deal with hope which is a nice thing to hear about. The finale when you find out that Andy had been tunneling out for twenty years was a very powerful one. It was amazing to think about how it was accomplished and how he never gave up hope.The story really drives this film and the script is terrific. The performance and characters are top notch and this movie should definitely be seen by anyone who is a fan of movies.	10
 None film inspires more!		10
 The grim reality of prison life	Andy is a innocent man, who is thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit, he finds himself having to survive and in turn begins a life long friendship with another inmate.This film is raw and intense, it doesn't hide the brutal honesty of prison life. I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that are very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his rage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness as he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances, especially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the audience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is released; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable to find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after his old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls his way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out, while the rain falls on him. It's one the greatest moments in cinema, I began to breath once again; something I was unable to do throughout the film. Simply mesmerising.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption, A Movie That Everybody Must See	This is without a doubt my favorite movie. I can see this movie so many times, and I never get tired, because I always feel the magic and the beauty of it. Almost all the time when I talk about movies, I strongly recommend The Shawshank Redemption.The roles of Andy Dufresne, Red, Brooks and several others are very well performed. This movie just have it all: excellent music, it's fantastically written, good acting, etc.It's so hard to believe that this wonderful movie was not awarded neither at The Oscars nor The Golden Globes, but the best of all is that The IMDb voters have it at #1. It really deserves to be at the top.	10
 Simple The Best Flick ever Made....	well...you normally don't find these types of movie all the time. In Shawshank you can see Tim Robbins at his best when compared to other movies...goes hand in hand with the plot...nd totally suits the Character to be resembled in the movie.Well this must be the best of Morgan Freeman..and as the movie reaches its climax it makes one more curious. As the movie moves towards its ending it thickens more involving one into it. Perfect plot , awesome Direction. The movie includes all it needs to show about prison life like violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars.Final ending is not at all predictable which forms a shocking climax.The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting, exciting and cathartic.This movie would always stay on the Top in my List.	10
 timeless masterpiece	The shawshank redemption is just sheer brilliance in cinema at its best.it is hard to think that a film with no action and little change of setting would be one of the greatest films of all time if not the greatest, built on a low budget this tale of hope follows Andy dusfrene (Robbins) as an inmate at shawshank prison and how he redeems himself as a person with the power of strong friendships and enduring hope. if you have not seen it stop anything that you're doing and go out and view this masterpiece in any form you can. with unforgettable performances from Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins this film will be found spectacular by any generation including these to come.	10
 By joe, what a film!	Well I bought this film and thought it would be a boring film about a prison, but no I was seriously wrong it has to be one of the most greatest films I have ever seen, portraying the beauty of friendship so strong that the world could hang upon. I was engrossed by the film entirely from start to finish, with it's humours, it's sadness, it's action. I was so wrong to buy with a half hearted feeling. I would recommend this film to anyone as the film they would most enjoy. My favourite part was right at the end where Red goes and finds the box and goes back to Andy and that scene on the beach was what got me; like a strike of lightning, so much I nearly cried. The part where Andy has the guts to go to a Hitler like man and talk to him about his finances goes to show that there are people in the world who can make the smallest difference but the biggest changes.	10
 Amazing Achievement	I feel this movie is a bit underrated/unappreciated, but it is truly one of my favorites of all time. Topnotch script, flawless acting. What a powerful story. Perfect casting. Maybe the most effective I've ever seen Morgan Freemen (and that's saying a lot). Parts of this movie were a bit difficult to watch, due to how brutally realistic the scenes where. This gut-wrenching film always managed to provide a small glimmer of hope, in spite of seemingly unsurmountable odds. The hard lessons learned and the viciousness of the warden and his imps stack up against the humble, meek and cleaver lead character, brilliantly played by Tim Robbins (his best work to date). I've lost count of just how many times I've seen this marvelous film, but each time I discover something that I missed previously. One of the best endings in cinematic history.	9
 This movie not only had a good story but the story telling also was commendable.		9
 life is all about hope	One of the finest movies you will ever see!GodfatherII was my previous best but now i have to acknowledge that shawshank was unique and prolific in its own way.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver an outstanding performance and one has to say did a real justice to their roles.This movie is about hope, and time.Time you need to do things you wanna do,and time you need you to plan those things you wanna do.You will find an immensely deep character of Andy dufresne and you will have to wait till end to find out the height of his intellect,his vision and above all his hope.Really a must see movie for those who think hope is a dangerous thing!!	9
 Loved it	One of my all time favorite movies along with The Green Mile. I love the Stephen King stories of both and I thought they did an excellent job of making movies from them. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are excellent as usual. If you haven't seen this movie you should try it. I don't think you will be disappointed. Excellent characters throughout the movie and a most enjoyable watch. Also if you get the chance read the Stephen King story it was adapted from. You don't have to be a Stephen King fan to enjoy this movie so give it a try. Well I am trying to write something without giving a spoiler or putting in junk words but it seems IMDb insists I write at least 10 lines of text when just 3 or 4 lines would do.	10
 Tremendous Neverending Thrilling Film And The Very Best Movie I've Ever Seen!	I Thought To Myself At First When I First viewed this movie it wasn't at all going to be any worser than most movies i've seen. But I was wrong. It's the best adapted movie of all time and I think I ought say it's the best movie I've ever seen since The Dark Knight. I haven't seen The Godfather Francise Yet but don't really want to now that I've seen The Shawshank Redemption the very best movie and the top of my favorite movie lists. It's powerful and jaw-dropping and can get very emotional at times and the best thing about this film is Tim Robins the best actor of all time and Morgan Freeman clearly the main character of the film. The bad guys are the captain of the guards Mr Hatley I remember and Norton the Worton the biggest assholes I've seen in a movie that can drive you insane. And also Brookes and the guy with the beard around his cheeks can't remember his name they were good too. Best Movie of all time period 10/10	10
 An achievement in film making and life overall.		10
 Almost perfect		10
 Masterpiece	"If there is a movie which defines ""masterpiece"" this will be it. It has been a long time I saw a movie which really surprised me. You will never know what is about to come. And when it ends, you find the glimmering shine of hope. If this movie released any year other the year of the Forrest Gump I am sure it would have swept the Academy Awards.I usually don't like watching a decade old movie, but since this movie, i have already gone through a dozen on the top 250 list. Morgan Freeman is great as usual. So is Tim Robbins and James Whitmore. The whole cast brings alive the spirit of the movie. And my suggestion to all who haven't seen it already would be- add this to the top of your to-do-list.Fan of such Hope-giving and Inspiring films: Shashank"	10
 one of the very best	"a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory... this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstances it perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him. i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great. this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel. watch it and tell me it could not touch you Andy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.""a very great one, with so many moments burned forever in my memory...this is a movie about hope and about staying yourself, even under such circumstancesit perfectly mixes the best use of a narrator voice i have watched so far with beautiful and still very honest pictures and great dialogs, telling the story of a man thrown into prison for a crime he did not commit. despite all the pain he meets there, all the hopelessness those high gray walls suggest he manages to preserve his hope and humanity, even to do something good for the people around him.i couldn't imagine a better cast for it, especially liked Clancy Brown as a nasty, sadistic Captain, but all were great.this is one of the few movies i know being better than the books they are based on - in this case it's not that difficult in fact, with the novel being rather mediocre and a bit boring somehow. and for sure this is the best movie based on a Stephen King novel.watch it and tell me it could not touch youAndy Dufresne: (in letter to Red) ""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."""	10
 Shawshank Redemtion	"This was a great movie. What makes this movie so good is the irony that is used. Since the story was being told from Red's point of view, no one knew exactly all the things that Andy was doing to exscape. When the wardon came and checked his room, no one thought nothing of him having his bible. That's when the wardon said his favorite passage was ""Salvation lies within"". When he asked Red for a rock hammer, no one really expected for him to use it to exscape because it would take so long. Then we asked for the poster, I figured he just needed something to make his time there more better. Once he actually came up missing. I really didn't know what to expect. When the wardon finds out how he got out, he left that favorite passage in the beginning showing that Andy's salvation really did lie within the bible. That's why i think the irony is very good and that is what really makes this a good movie."	
 a movie..about HOPE		10
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" C@RLO$ mcdonnough"	I really enjoyed watching this film. From start to finish this movie had me guessing on what it was leading to. Tim Robins played great in the movie, he made himself look mysterious which made me always wonder what he would do next especially knowing that he is a intelligent character. The part that caught me by surprise is the night that he asked for the rope i swore that he was going to kill himself but it turns out that in the morning he had done the impossible. Morgan Freeman also played good as a narrator which made it seem as if he was what the story was about which made Andy even more mysterious because not much is revealed about him.	8
 Perfect in every single way	So, i watched this film thinking it'd be pretty good. Was i wrong. It wasn't good, nor was it bad-it was perfect. It's hard to get a perfect film but i think this is a film that if you don't watch before you die your crazy. The story is an adaption of Stephen King's (when you hear that name you know it's going to be good) novel by the same name. It's about a prisoner put in jail for life for the wrong crime. He makes friends, people die, life moves on through his hardship until the chance to escape walks along. Overall 10/10, you could describe it with any word it'd still be awesome. Acting - Morgan Freeman was 10/10 in this, and through a lot of his movies. Tim Robbins made a character that was calm and cool and scared and worried etc. and could change through his emotions in a heartbeat. 10/10I'll stop it there, but that's all you need to know. It deserves to be top and if you don't think so cast your opinions because until then it'll just keep being perfect.	10
 One of the best stories ever told	It is a great movie which received 7 Academy award nominations but lost to eventual winner Forrest Gump and ranked 1# on IMDb.So there was enough curiosity to watch this one.It is a very intelligent film in terms of story telling.The director deserves kudos for extracting such fine performances from his lead pair,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman who received Academy award nominations for their respective roles. Now the main question is does it deserve the top spot on IMDb.Well,the immediate answer is NO.The Godfather may be superior to The Shawshank Redemption by all means but it manages to hold its own and is complete as a film.Shawshank is a treat for the viewers.Do watch it for its gripping story well told.	10
 Greatest movie of all time... finally on top!		10
 A simple tale wonderfully told		10
 narrative symphony		9
 Fantastic storytelling. A modern movie classic.	I was not born when this movie came out so I have just had the chance to watch this movie and actually appreciate it recently and I must say I can see why this movie is recognized as one of the best movies of all times. The movie generally gets across human emotion and the acting and directing of everyone involved makes this movie a brilliant show alone. Not only is the movie well made but the story of it is fantastic and certainly does not mess up Stephen Kings novel. Even in it's near 3 hour runtime it does not ever get boring (and this is coming from someone who comes from the add generation) and always has a story to tell. Everything in this movie is important about the storytelling, from the main story to even Brooks story of him spending 50 years in prison and then being released and realizing he is completely dependent on the prison and has become used to being enclosed in its walls.Overall, the film is a masterpiece and I am glad I got to watch such a fantastic film. It is certainly up there in terms of the best movie of all time, and even though I am a little hesitant to call it the best, I would definitely put it in the top 10. I give this movie 96%.	8
 one of the best for ever	for sure this is my favourite more than 'in bruges' though the movie is not technically when you watch it now,it doesn't matter because you wont feel that you are watching a old movie .the emotion played such a big role,also 'the characters did good justice for it.i was almost in tears when that fat ass was screwed by the cop.the character brookes is stills in my eyes (the way he walked in the road when He was out of prison ,the innocence in his face when he tried to kill his friend,that made me fall in love with this movie.not even in my dreams i expected the he#ll go out of jail.and the friendship between red and him after he faces people who were gay.... ithink this movie should have been given all the seven Oscars.	10
 Moving & Compelling....gets me every time!!!	"This is a movie that does not try to outsmart its viewer. It's a simple story of friendship and ""brotherhood"", of good and evil. One of the biggest things I got from this film is patience and determination. The way the lead character Andy Dufresne, put up with the ""wrongs"" throughout his life to finally be free. Traveling through 400 yards of sh*t to taste freedom speaks volumes of his lifelong battle. I cannot begin to count the times I've seen this movie. ""Shawshank"" is one of those movies that when you stumble upon it while channel surfing, you have to watch it until the end. No matter how many times I've seen it, I still weep at the ""Brooks was here"" scene and at the ending of the movie. Such a well cast movie, you grow a fondness for the characters good and bad. If I had to point out one flaw, it would be the ""Elvis"" prisoner..... but this is only a mere speck that cannot dull the shine of this outstanding movie. This is a movie that should have swept the Oscars in 1995. Between the writing and the acting performances, It's a ""no-brainer""."	10
 Wow, inspiring story...		10
 Emotionally Entertaining	"The Shawshank Redemption is arguably the finest work from Morgan Freeman, and up-holds as one of my favourite ""prison"" movies. A movie that walked out with zero Oscars in the 1994 Academy Awards and to earn it's place on top of the two-fifty, it's very impressive. They're some very memorable quotes, characters, stages and scenes in this movie that'll never be forgotten. It shows the value of friend-ship, a accurate display of what prison is like and very good acting. The thought of The Shawshank Redemption not winning an Oscar for its acting, writing or whatever is way beyond me. The Shawshank Redemption in my eyes is no solid masterpiece, but the hate and bash it gets feels totally unacceptable. A very solid movie with a suitable duration and some powerfully moving emotional scenes. One for everyone to see."	
 A brilliant movie but it's still far away from being the best one!	Shawshank Redemption is an excellent movie.It's directed good,acted good,written good and it definitely deserved a few Oscar's.There is no doubt about it.It also deserves to be on IMDb's 250 list,as it is.However,i must say that it's very,very overrated on IMDb.Even though it's a great movie,it's still far,far away from being the best one!All of you who haven't seen this movie-should see it.But please don't believe in IMDb's rating's!If you do you might be disappointed because even though this is a great movie it's still not even close to being the best one! There is a lot of movies better then this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	9
 Speechless	There aren't words too describe the greatness of this movie. The Directing is fantastic. The music, moving. The dialog, amazing. The story, exhilarating. Stephen Kings fantastic story of hope has been brought to the screen as my second favored movie of all time.Andy Dufresene (Tim Robbins) is a middle aged man who has been wrongly sent to prison for the murder of his wife and her lover. With a lifetime to spend in Shawshank state prison he makes friends with an old timer at Shawshank, Ellis Boyd Redding(Morgan Freenman). Sfter a couple of years of abuse at the hands of the sisters (led by Mark Rolston) Andy makes nice with the guards and becomes the teachers pet of the prison. During his time at Shawshank Andy endures more hell than anyone could ever imagine. From a friend dying to 50 feet of unimaginable stench.This movie was not as well received as it should have been. It may have been nominated for a couple of Oscars but the viewer reception was just not to great. This movie is my favored only behind A Few Good Men.	10
 Shock and Awe.		8
 The Shawshank Redemption	I have seen numerous movies in my life, yet I return to this one time and time again because of the message it caries. The plot is generic yet the acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman create an authentic and realistic setting. Morgan Freeman's voice narrates this emotional masterpiece, the tone of his low voice remains constant like the time in our lives. This movie shows just that, that times keeps flowing on by, you may hit some walls here and there yet you must make the best of it. Andy(Robbins) through various actions attracts many admirers at Shawshank even those unpleasant. Through these friends he finds solace. If you are into GREAT movies this is the ultimate, after this movie I knew that I would never see a better movie thereafter, and that conclusion has stood the test of time.	10
 A True Movie of Character		9
 Best Movie of all Time	"Adapted from a Stephen King novella, The Shawshank Redemption takes a prison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise on how to approach the business of day-to-day life in the face of a desperately Sisyphian reality. As the film's signature line suggests, ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'."" Filmed on location in an Ohio prison, the film occasionally lapses into familiar formulas and well-known stereotypes of the prison-drama genre, but overcomes them due in no small part to a pair of transcendent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Director Frank Darabont and cinematographer Roger Deakins (a Coen brothers collaborator) recreate the drudgery and hopelessness of prison life in both the look and the details of dreary rituals of daily life. Spanning twenty years in the lives of its protagonists, Darabont's screenplay and direction allow us the luxury of getting to know these men -- hardened criminals, with little hope for the future -- through a series of quietly captivating scenes that slowly build atmosphere and tension without sacrificing characterization and thematic integrity. A critical success but a box office failure when it was first released, the film was nominated for seven Oscars, but won nary a one. Only when Shawshank was released on video did it steadily garner full-fledged public reverence."	10
 Best Movie I Have Ever Seen		10
 shaw shank	one of the best ever...yuk everyone who hates on this film, listen to about every great film critic and you'll hear its on top of their list. best lines are used in everyday use. ending is stellar. plot and story line are ridiculous. freeman and Robbin's are amazing in the leads and possibly their best film ever. camera angles and vantage points are always incredible. from a short story to a full length movie is a ingenious move. Robbin's performance is impeccable and Freeman's acting can not be described unless it is flawless. what more can be said? you basically are a joke if this movie doesn't rank in your top 5. You must see this movie...if not don't rank any others!	10
 no contest	"I'm 23 and consider myself a ""movie buff"" whenever someone ask the question well whats your favorite movie i say shawshank. don't even need to say the whole title everyone knows and some people are just waiting to hear your answer so they can say ""no way this is the best"" but every time they pause and they are like yeah that movie is awesome. this movie played a huge factor on the actors in it. what was the last movie you saw that didn't have a part with morgan freeman narrating in it. i mean the real question is ""do you trust your wife?"" i mean come on this movie has everything in it! what andy does to the Warden is amazing no hero character gets the bad guy better then what he does. ""brooks was here, so was red"" that part is a very underrated part in the movie which i think has a lot of impact. is anyone else like me in when they see that movie on TV no matter what part just have to watch it to the end? i have gone threw 3 of this DVD from just watching it so much or letting people borrow it that have never seen it. also is there anyone out there that doesn't like this movie?"	10
 A Great Success Story with Andy Duffresne and Red!		9
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Classic Movie Experience	"Well. I don't have anything to say but, the movie was 100% great. Morgan Freeman is the man. Superb acting & great story with everyone in the family can watch this movie together. Anyone haven't watched this classic movie, please watch it. It's worth it buying the original DVD from Amazon or CD Universe. The script is greatly done. Movies like this are more offently released. I watched it twice & I have the original DVD with me. Talking about ""Stephen King"" great writer & I loved his films such as ""Secret Window"", ""Red Rose"", ""The Mist"", ""Pet Semetary"" are some of the movies I really preferred watching. The good thing is that this movie are released by all the good production companies like Castelock Entertainment, Warner Brothers & 20th Century Fox.That's all. Again great movie. Watch it!!!"	8
 The Best Prison Story On Film	"Few movies can get this critic watching them again and again, but Shawshank hits the mark on it's near flawless story and cinematography. With the brilliant acting of Morgan Freeman and as Red and Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, this adaptation of a Stephen King novella reaches out to audiences of all backgrounds.Comedy lovers need not be discouraged as The Shawshank Redemption is without comic relief to lighten the dramatic tensions laced within the movie.My one criticism though is that write/director Frank Darabont just had to yank that extra tear out of the audience. This was apparent in certain scenes as the one when Brooks Hatlen has too much ""trouble"" with his free life."	10
 A very good film. But not THAT good...	This film is probably one of if not the best sleeper hits in film history. Of all the votes cast on IMDb, I bet less than 1% saw the film at the cinema. Like all sleeper hits, under-hyped at the time of release, when you watch it and revel in its brilliance, your hair standing on end in parts, it feels more personal to you than a massive blockbuster. I think this is why it is so over-rated. it is not a ten. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are so fantastic and the story is so emotionally wrought that it is possible to get carried away. But better than the Godfather? Gimme a break!!! We are comparing the work of a superb craftsman with the work of a visionary artist whose films have had more influence on modern cinema than anyone bar perhaps his old film-school mates. A fantastic, hugely-credible tearjerker. By the DVD, get it out now and again, get yer tissues ready.	8

 Best stuff i've ever seen	If you guys are having the sparing some of your time to watch a movie,you must check out The Shawshank Redemption. It has gotta be the best motion picture ever made. It simply touches your soul and leaves such a thunderous impact on you. A very simple story which tells you to have hope,no matter what circumstances may arise. I am thoroughly out of words to describe how good this movie is. Doesn't matter what genre you like but in no way are you not going to appreciate the beauty of this movie. It tells us how hope is a good thing,maybe the best of the things there are & good things never die. Simply outstanding stuff. Best motion movie ever made. Period.	10
 the best movie ever	why i think this is the best movie ever!!! ..... i think is the best movie ever cause u will never hear someone to tell u that he doesn't liked that movie (in any age that can understand about movies)!! so we have a movie that everyone likes no exceptions !!! do u know another movie that all people likes?? i am not sure there is !!! as example ,,, godfather ,,, perfect movie but for some people that they don't like the subject of the movie is not so good !!! ... so i think is good choice to be no 1!!.............................. ............................................................ ............................ any different opinions will be discussed!!!	10

 Please don't miss this one film........		10
 The best movie i have ever seen	Hope can set anyone free, imprisoned or not imprisoned, it affects us all.The shawshank redemption is not only the greatest movie i have ever seen, but it also consists of the greatest screen play I have ever seen. Morgan Freemen and Tim Robbins were casted perfectly, and it was the screen play that made it great. The scenery was great as welll, like when Red was walking out of the field andy told him to go to, and the crickets were flying all over the place. I loved watching how Morgan Freemen before on the bus before he got andys gift and after, Andy gave him hope and it set him free.The fact is this movie has it all. Screenplay, acting, scenery, and of course the little things that make the Shawshank deserving to hold the 1 spot on my list for greatest movies ever made	10
 There are not many movies I would give 10/10	I first saw this film some years ago and it left a deep impression on my mind. Recently I made a list of films that I had seen before that I would like to see again. Top of my list was The Shawshank Redemption. All I could remember of the film was that it was about 2 men in Prison BUT that it had made a deep impression on me and I wanted to see it again. I got to see it again and I was not disappointed. It was on local TV and even all the ads couldn't spoil it. I was entranced by the two chief characters who were superb and also by the secondary characters. As the final credits rolled I felt as though I could watch it again and pick up on things that I had missed. I've never felt like that before about any film. I haven't checked as to whether this movie received any Oscars but it certainly should have for the characters, for the story, for best film and so on. I highly recommend this movie. Definitely 10/10. I'm off to find it on DVD.	10
 Wow! It just doesn't get much better than this!	I must say that movies like this are certainly rare. There aren't many other movies that can combine drama and comedy and also a moral lesson that speaks to the heart as this one does. I actually watched this movie in my high school AP English 4 class as we were comparing it to the novel One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich by Alexandr Solzhenitsyn. While that was a good book, Shawshank is SO much better. I was surprised that our teacher actually let us watch it because our school was somewhat anal about movies with sex and/or language in it but I am so glad i got to see it. It was the highlight of the class. The main character of Andy has a quality that all of us possess, which is the desire to defy the odds overcome our obstacles. There's not much more I can say that has not already been said. Wonderful movie with great acting and a lesson that is important for everyone 9 stars!	9
 The Picture of Freedom		9
 Shawshank has a sobering message for everyone.		8
 Will leave you inspired		8
 Not about Jail	To most this is jail break movie, to others it's about friendship, yet some swear by how it is about standing up against authority.See, the thing with great movies is that they're always about simple things. This movie was about life - about the mistakes you make - about the price you might have to pay - about the irony in it - and of course, about redemption. There is not a single moment in the movie when you feel the crew has lost their grip on the script.What I enjoyed the most was Morgan Freeman's soliloquies. The dialogues a quoteworthy and are etched long after the movie ends.This is one of those movies you never get tired of watching.	10
 An Outstanding Movie That Will Be Around A Long Time	With the many other entries already here, I won't bore the reader with another synopsis. But hopefully, I will provide the details of one scene that sticks out so greatly in my memory because of the unbelievable (and fantastic) attention to detail that is not only here but is gloriously throughout this whole movie.Towards the end, Red (Morgan Freeman) is searching for something that Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) left for him. Red has been paroled but the possibility still exists that he will either kill himself like Brooks or commit a crime just to get back into the safety of prison. His day job (bag boy at a local grocery store) is going nowhere.Months (possibly years) before, Andy gave Red directions on finding something very important if Red ever got out of prison. Red finally with nothing else left to do, follows up on that request. He travels a fairly long way (for him), across some difficult terrain and comes upon the scene described. Yet, it still requires searching and faith to uncover what Andy has left him.Finally, he finds it, and opens the contents, and his life is changed forever.What is so important is the minute detail of this scene  the location is not next to some superhighway but far off the most unbeaten path one could imagine. The object is not carelessly left under one rock, but under a number. Many people would have assumed they were in the wrong place after a few minutes of not finding the object and moved on.Finally, when Red does find it, he looks very furtively around him sure that someone must be watching him. He sits down, now practically hidden from any possible passers-by, and opens the object, and what he finds inside leads him to even more frightenedly glance around, sure now that there must be others watching, he must be found out, HE MUST STILL BE IN PRISON.This whole scene could have been done it about two minutes, a couple of quick cuts, him opening the box and discovering the contents and then a cut to the next scene. But, it isn't that at all, it is one of the most intricate scenes I have ever witnessed for what is a small advancement of the plot. But that's the catch. This is so important to the plot, that the scene had to be given this kind of detail, so that the viewer would completely understand what Andy was talking about and what Red had to discover. Red for all practical purposes was still in prison  and he wasn't living yet, he was still getting busy dying.At this moment in the movie, Red (and you the viewer) still doesn't know if Andy made it on the outside. He escaped, but where to? Yes there was that (more or less) cryptic postcard, but especially how did whatever Andy left for Red figure into the story? When would Andy have buried it? How did he know what to put inside it? Considering the search underway for Andy on the day following his escape, if I were Andy, as soon as I recovered the money from the banks, I would have been long gone, far, far out of the state of Maine. I certainly wouldn't want the warden walking into any of the banks and finding me there, and it would have taken several days for the newspaper to decide to publish the article and especially for the State Corrections officials to come down on the warden even with all the incriminating evidence. Andy needed to be gone for several months until all the hoopla had died down before he could return to actually bury the object. So, the intricacy of this scene now becomes clear as it really has to match the intricacy of Andy's planning for every detail This whole sequence is so important to the story, because it's now time for Red to decide if he should get busy dying or get busy living, because he now finally has the choice. Maybe this movie is more about Red's growth then about Andy's resilience. Andy always had his drive, Red needed to learn it. Andy gave him the courage to finally face his own demons and overcome them. Red now has his chance at redemption. Remember, Andy didn't commit any crimes, Red did. Andy really didn't need to be redeemed - Red needed it badly, The performances by Tim Robbins, especially when he tells Red of his request and Red imagines the worst, and of Morgan Freeman in this little scene are spectacular. I cannot possibly imagine any other actors pulling this off.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	The Shawshank Redemption is a unique movie.Tim Robbins gives the performance of his life and this is the movie for which Morgan Freeman deserved to win an Oscar but didn't. There are many twists and turns and the ending is very poignant.In fact, the entire last third of movie is filled with marvelous scenes. If there is any drawback to this movie, it is that it is a tad too long, meaning it's often edited when it is shown with commercials on TV. Rent this, or better yet, buy it to enjoy it fully.	
 Heart Wrenching Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie. You can tell it is a great movie from the very beginning. Unlike many movies of the same type, the main character gets away, and the main villain gets what was coming too him. The Scene where Andy escapes is one of those scenes that will stick with you for a long time. It is without a doubt one of my favorite movie scenes. The way he is just stripping his clothes and throwing them on the ground, it really gives you a since for how emotional a moment it is for him. When he looks up at the sky, it just makes you want to cry. Hey that rhymed. Anyway, everyone should see this movie.	9
 Perhaps the greatest film ever made...	This film captivates the imagination and gives all who watch it hope. For a film to put you to tears through happiness and sadness it really has to be something special. It has one of the greatest twists ever in film and has an ending that is unrivalled, it could not have been made any better. I have watched it maybe twenty times, its always an inspiration and an excellent tonic for those of us living a life we would like to change.The lines and the narration at the end are like poetry and the message of hope and human defiance is transcended to all. I can't recommend this film highly enough, it is an emotional roller-coaster but truly magical and will leave you warm inside.A masterpiece.	10
 Triumph of the human spirit	"When I first got this movie I was never bothered to watch it. I first heard of it from my cousin who said it was ""so damn good"". I never watched it for two months but when I got seriously bored I just decided it was time. And boy was my cousin right. This film is damn good. Andy Dufrene is accused of murder due to circumstantial evidence which results in him being sent to shawshank. There he meets Red and his mates. Over the years they bond and share a powerful friendship. This film tells the triumph of the human spirit, and how hope is a good thing. The acting is top notch, direction and cinematography brilliant, and the soundtrack empathizes the film like no other can. I seriously recommend this film to those that want to see a brilliant masterpiece.9/10"	9
 Faith sets you free	"I have no words to express the feelings I got after watching the climax of The Shawshank Redemption.Very few movies touch you and still fewer stays in you mind for a long time.Shawshank redemption managed to do both.In my opinion ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best movie to be made up to date.I don't really have to tell about Morgan Freeman,he is such a pleasure to watch.Some scenes are so poignant that you forget yourself.I particularly want to mention the scene in which Andy Dufresne plays the music in the loud speaker so that the prisoners be able to hear the wonderful music.The climax where Boyd Red reunites with Andy gives you a strange melodramatic feeling which only movies like Shawshank redemption,Forrest Gump gives."	10
 A remarkable film, in so many ways	I was initially sceptical about watching this film, the movie's advertisements never held much appeal for me but seeing as though I was sitting bored on a Friday night I decided to give it a go.And from start to end I was engrossed The film really gives an accurate interpretation to what life inside a maximum security prison would have been like, I was left wincing several times during the inevitable outbreak of violence. The film contains something for everyone, there's sorrow, friendship, violence my main complaint was that there were a few elements I did not understand, particularly in the scenes that regard the accountancy work that the main character engages in.The acting was unforgettable, Tim Robbins deserves credit as the main seemingly devoid of all feelings, yet with that certain characteristic about him, Morgan Freeman as usual shines through as the man who can 'get things' and my personal favourite Clancy Brown as the sadistic hard ass security captain.I recommend that everyone see this movie at least once, it is without a doubt one of the great classics of our time.	9
 This is by far one of the best drama's ever	This movie is absolute perfection. The story is about a bank teller, Andy, (Robbins)who is wrongfully imprisoned for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Red (Freeman) becomes his best friend. The movie progresses by showing the life that Andy has to endure in prison. For example, he becomes a prime target by a few homicidal sodomites and obviously has to fight them off, which ends with him in the infirmary.The movie is excellent because it shows a very accurate portrayal of prison life, and the corruption within the prison by the blood thirsty power crazed guards, and the so called religious and honest warden, who is really a greedy sadistic manipulator who takes advantage of Andy by forcing him to do his taxes and make him work to make him rich.This movie may very bell be the best movie you ever see. It's real, it's dramatic, funny and has everything that a good drama needs. WATCH IT!!!	10
 Still riveting after so many years		10
 I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged	"Perhaps the best line in the film can also be used to describe this film; a caged bird (the film) that shouldn't be locked up (at the video store).""The Shawshank Redemption"" can be described in only one word: Powerful.It is my favorite movie.Let me give you a short summary. Andy Drufesne (pronounced Dufrene; and played by Tim Robbins (Bull Durham)), the vice president of a large Portland, Maine bank, is given a life sentence in Shawshank Prison after he is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, run by religious Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) and sadistic Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). He befriends fellow prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman (Driving Miss Daisy)). Over a few decades, Andy befriends the inmates, begins a library, education system and work program. But Andy is innocent, and has trouble convincing the authorities of that, and the film works up to the inspirational and excellent climax.Robbins and Freeman blend into their roles like chameleons, and the script is well written.I will sum up the review in this one statement: go see it.You will not be disappointed."	10
 Beautiful movie	First I must say that The Shawshank redemption is with no doubt a masterpiece.It is important to say that these days Hollywood is not making quality artistic movies,it is all about blockbusters,high budgets,commercial movies and special effects.Well,this movie on the contorary is one of the most important films of the 90's and maybe the most touching movie of all time.Full of or realist emotions this movie touches the heart of the average viewer in a very impressive and original way.It is a tale of hope and dreams of freedom.In 1994,almost unknown Frank Dourbunt created a movie that changed the movie history and showed to people that in the day of special effects and extremely gory film there can be a film totally different from all the others.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are great in this movie and they really deserved numerous awards that they received for making this film.There are many people who claimed that his movie changed their way of living and thinking in a good way and that is the biggest thing that a product of the 7th art can achieve.	10
 As perfect a story as has ever been written		10
 The Honest, The Emotional, The Best	My family told me this film was a deeply philosophical film which required mature minds to be able to understand. I couldn't disagree more. The Shawshank Redemption is about a man going to prison after being found guilty of murder of his wife, later to be discovered he was wrongly convicted. The story goes from Robbins being a small fish in a big pond in the prison to being a respected figure throughout the film and various events happening along the way. This picture is the only to make me lie awake at night thinking about life and its dreams. I cried during Shawshank and I'm proud of it, I've never felt so passionate about life and its important things. The Shawshank Redemption is about Love For Friends, Hope, Death, Humanity and Loss. Thank You	10
" ""Everybody's Innocent. Didn't you know that?"""		10
 Hope springs eternal...	"This movie was easily the best one based on a Stephen King and Frank Darabont screenplay. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman act very well together as best friends who find a way to deal with their difficult circumstances. Morgan Freeman's name in the movie is Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. He is a person who can get you things, for a profit. Tim Robbins' name in the movie is Andrew Dufresne. He is someone accused of killing his wife. Andy asks Red to get him such items as a small rock hammer and posters of famous starlets. Red is someone disillusioned by the racist prison system, and serves as the main narrator for the film. This places the audience deeply inside the minds of the protagonists and even of the villains. I thought that Frank Darabont's directing was excellent. While close to three hours, it is time well spent as the movie is well written, well cast, and well directed. A solid 10/10 and recommended purchase."	10
 Greatness in simplicity	"TITLE: The Shawshank Redemption COUNTRY: USA YEAR: 1994 RATING: 10/10For me, the key to a good film can be found on the way the story is told, which is to say, the development of the script. Sometimes when we think of movie classics we always tend to associate with complex plots while forgetting that simplicity can also mean greatness. A few days back, after watching ""Sunset Boulevard"" I could not stop thinking how a simple story could have been so well written and shot. I feel the same about ""The Shawshank Redemption"". The story, per se, is absolutely ordinary. In the hands of others it could have resulted in a bland product. But with wonderful writing and filming the story reached an entirely different level of density. It's the audience gain and the movie industry too."	10
 Hope is a good thing :)	Hope is a good thing - this is the best quote for me from the movie. When I am depressed, I watch this movie, and there is not a single time I have not felt good.From the very first scene, with a drunk and disturbed Andy, to the last scene, with a free and relieved Andy - I enjoy all the moments. You don't watch some movies, but you start feeling them, and believe me, it is one of them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceedingly good in this movies and so is the storyline. Some of the best moments of the movie are - Andy winning beer for his co-workers (yes, Andy refers to his prison mates as co-workers), Andy resisting the violent advancements from the homosexual prisoners and getting beaten up each time but still never giving up, Andy playing the music record without giving an ear to the warden, Brooks struggling to live his post-prison life and finally committing suicide, the warden madly asking the poster about Andy and finally discovering the tunnel, Red getting the parole approved, Red finding the stone and Andy's stuffs and above all, Morgan Freeman's narration. The script of the narration is brilliant and Morgan Freeman's baritone gives it the needed effect.If you love true cinema, this is a movie for you. If you have not watched it, do it now!!! If you have watched it, I am sure you must have done it more than once. The movie deserves it...	10
 Something else....		10
 Great Movie		10
 its like blood flowing in the veins of god		10
" getting a life ""do over"""	"Kids who play unorganized games of baseball, basketball, or football will often make use of a ""do over"". The ""do over"" happens when the kids can't agree on exactly how legal a play was, whether there was a penalty, or what exactly happened. That particular play is forgotten and the game proceeds. This film is about a life ""do over"".By all measures Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) was successful: he was a banker, married to a beautiful wife, and living in a pleasant home. When his wife is murdered, he is convicted and sent to prison. While not guilty of murder, he convicts himself for neglecting his wife and - it is hinted - his privileged life. Prison forms the environment for even harsher penalties for this crime. Ironically in his endurance Andy finds a deeper appreciation for simpler things: friendship, opera arias, and a cold beer after hard work on a hot day.Red (Morgan Freeman) is also serving a life sentence for murder. He slowly becomes Andy's best friend. Red is the prison's unofficial retailer and a peerless guide for Andy in survival. It is through Red that Andy gathers a close ring of friends.Andy's hope is born from the prison warden's avarice and hypocrisy. Using his banking skills Andy is able to reward the warden's greed and his friends. Andy organizes a prison library where Red and his circle work.Andy realizes he must act after the Warden reveals the full extent of his insatiably evil appetite by murdering the only person who could prove his innocence.This is a long movie but like all great movies that isn't noticed. While it is guilty of being in the common genre of prison movies and having the sort of clichéd ending for which Hollywood is canonized, lionized, cursed and scandalized, the true measure of this movie is that it still delivers a potent story. This is hope for the hopeless.Zihuatanejo!"	10
 Perfection	"I've seen thousands of films and this is by far one of the best I've ever seen. This is one of the rare films that was better than the book. It was taken from Stephen Kings short story ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" I am a huge Stephen King fan and also enjoyed the story very much. This movie blew me away. I'm not a big Tim Robbins fan but he is perfect fit this role. Morgan Freeman is great in this just like he is in everything he does. This film has some of the best lines in it. When Morgan Freeman is narrating and says ""The only one I know that could crawl through a river of $hit and come out clean on the other side..."" It gives me goosebumps. If you have never seen this you should go out and buy it today."	10
 Very close to perfection of the craft.	Deserves an Oscar for the vignette around Brooks Hatlen alone. When film students begin the path of learning about the art of motion pictures, they would be well served to study this as an example of what can be accomplished by a master craftsman.Using a simple plot as a foundation around which all the necessary detail and thoughtful insight of human conditions can be layered, this is the closest you can come to telling a story flawlessly on film.Screw all that. How good is it? Every single time I'm flipping through the channels and I see it's on, it doesn't matter where it is in the plot or time-line, I stop and watch.Every time.	10
 Innocence can indeed survive in hell		10
 Simply the best	"What can you say that others haven't said about this film? (I notice there are 200 pages of comments). I'll try this: It is, quite simply, the best movie ever made. I have never seen a list of best films that didn't include it, and don't expect to until I'm very old.You can't go far wrong with great actors in a great story; add in great direction and great cinematography, and you have a classic. For me to say that a movie is better than 'Casablanca' is quite something, but this is it. There aren't many films that have had their titles changed either, but down the years this one has simply become known as ""Shawshank"".Just a final note to mention James Whitmore, often overlooked in all the praise that has been heaped on the other leads. How he didn't win a gong for his portrayal of the prison librarian I will never know. Yet another inexplicable miss by the Academy."	10
 Just phenomenal	That's right, this film is so amazing, it doesn't need to stand behind a flashy tag line in a review. this film can speak for itself, Frank Darabont's true masterpiece.Tim Robbins gives an Oscar-gypt'd performance as Andy Dufresne, an upstanding banker, framed for murder and sentenced to two life terms. There he meets Red (played by the immortal Mr. Morgan Freeman, who gives us the best voice-overs in movie history.) In prison, Dufresne becomes well known with the inmates for his courage, after being raped basically everyday for a month, and hope that the justice system will see him through.This film is a true masterpiece that can only come from years in the movie business, but Frank had close to none. He had only done two films before that weren't very good, I guess this proves what you can do with raw talent today.	10
 Beautiful		10
 Very good movie, but is it one of the best ever?	I remember seeing this movie back when it first came out. I have watched it several times since then. I really like this movie, but in my opinion their are a lot of movies that are much better. When I look at the top 250 I cringe at this one. I think that movies like this belong among the top 250, but I feel that this one lacks what is needed to be towards the top of that list. Movies such as citizen kane, clockwork orange, or pulp fiction should not be lower on the list than this one. A good movie is one that is well written and acted. A great movie is one that redefines movie making and does something that has not been done before, or at least something that is going to be remembered forever. The godfather deserves top billing on the list. It was very well written, very real and had lines that are repeated daily in movies, television or in talk around the coffee pot. All I remember from shawshank is Tim Robbins hands in the air after he escapes.	9
 Breathtaking	"There is something about this movie that always hits me. Probably cause it's a wonderful metaphor of most of man's existence. I've seen it many times during the years and the last one was even more beautiful than I remembered. So astonishing it didn't win any Academy Award, but very often this is the price really good movies have to pay, and certainly Shawshank has not much of appealing when glamorous, star system slaves decide what is worth and what is not. Probably if this movie was released nowadays it would have received more attention from the public (see the contents of recent nominees for best film in the last two Academy Award Night editions). However... A movie is great when you it keeps on flashing in your mind for the following days while you are working or doing something else. The best quote from it, according to me, is ""Get busy living.. or get busy dying"". Revealing."	10
 Interesting	I have to say that at first, I thought this movie would be boring. The storyline seemed so plain to me that I thought it was just one of those movies I would fall asleep to. But, one day, I decided to give this movie a shot. The storyline was simple as I had expected it to be but the director definitely did a good job in keeping it interesting all the same. The acting was flawless and even though the ending was a little bit too 'happy' for me, it didn't hurt the movie as a whole. It's not the best drama I've seen in my life, but it's definitely a movie that will keep you entertained and make you think about certain things in life.	10
 beyond words!	I saw this movie while still in university, kind of gloomy at first. while after several unexpected sharp turns , everything is clear with the sun rising above the horizon. I was totally shocked by the development of the plot with the protagonist trying an unusual means to get out of the prison and finally realized his dream of being free , unbelievable and amazing! Redemption of the sincere prisoners. Redemption of justice. With the movie coming to an end, the bad were doomed, the good were redemption ed. It should be like this. Life cycles. Man proposes, God deposes. That is the meaning of life, I think so.Meanwhile, without the support of these two excellent main characters, this movie can hardly be as good as this.	10
 On the way to Freedom		
 Perfect, and the best movie of 1994, if not the whole '90's.		10
 Best movie I've ever seen	This is the best movie I've ever seen, actually, I think it surpassed the Godfather. There are four things that I liked about this movie. 1)The storyline is terrific and unique. A former banker went into prison of murdering his wife, but he hasn't done all of that. We haven't seen this kind of movie yet. 2)The theme. The movie is about prison, in our impression, prison is a bad place, and everybody that went to prison will be desperate. But not Andy, he got along with those prisoners, and kept thinking about escape. That educates the people, don't give up hope. 3)The character. The main characters were impressive, Andy: He was well-educated, and unlucky, hopeful, and intelligent. Red: He was friendly, smart, but he wasn't hopeful. He didn't know what to do after the parole. Anyway, he overcame it at last. 4)The acting: Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an excellent job in acting, and every single character in the Shawshank Redemption did well. Well, I think this movie has taken Godfather's place, to be the best movie I've ever seen.	10
 Hope and Despair		8
 Enjoy the excellence and perfection		10
 If you love movies, you will love Shawshank!		10
 The thinking man's prison movie.	This story takes place in prison but that is not to say it is a prison movie, because The Shawshank Redemption is so much more.In all reality this movie is a story about human nature at it's worst and best. It's about friendship and loss, full of emotion, irony, humor and nostalgia. All wrapped around one hell of a satisfying plot twist and revenge sequence against the story's antagonists you'll probably ever see.The icing on this scrumptious cake is one hell of a divine original scoring from composer Thomas Newman, the man who scored The Green Mile and American Beauty. It is haunting and often very moving. I realize that for many people one small segment of music in even a great film isn't enough to invoke a desire to watch the entire film. However there is a approximately 10 second segment of the score near the end of the film that will break your heart. You'll know which segment I mean if you see this film and if you're the right kind of person with a good soul, it will move you to tears. Somehow the movie manages to pull off an epic feel despite the backdrop being prison bars and walls. You really feel you've gone through the years with the two main characters in the film, by the end you really feel for these characters as if they were your friends. Making the end of their journey in this film affect you strongly. I would call this the best prison movie ever but for the fact that it really isn't a prison movie more than truly magnificent story that happens to take place in prison. This is however one of the best films ever made and I highly recommend it. This movie, especially the last 15 or 20 minutes will stay with you for years to come. It haunts me to this day.	10
 Inspiring and Amazing. This is my favourite film		10
 Excellent film!	One of my favorite films, I saw it awhile ago, and this film holds special magic that took away the day I watched it any bad feeling or anything I felt about that day. Story about humankind above all, and friendships, and the power of people believing in you, in a yet real way and not too cheesy way, that leaves you with a great taste in the mouth, and charisma of the two characters is excellent. The plot seemed a little far fetched first, but again, character development and power of human behavior is what makes this film so great. THere's something that strikes you to the emotion, and some simplicity in the film as well, that the moral and theme is, enjoy life, and don't forget those that are dear for you.	
 Simply Amazing	"This is definitely the best film I have ever seen, Tim Robbins Plays the Best Role Of His Career Portraying A Convicted Murderer In Shawshank Prison, The relationship with him and ""Red"" grows through the movie, there are many ups and downs through his prison life and he comes through most of them, Tommy gives him hope of finally being free but the idea is foiled after not long. Then a perfect ending follows. Quotes Such as ""Get Busy Livin', Or get Busy Dyin'"" and ""Hope Is A Good Thing, Maybe The Best Of Things, And No Good Thing Ever Dies"" more memorable from this movietruly amazing film I would recommend it to anyone, of you haven't seen this you must watch it before you die!!!"	10
 One of my own personal favorites		10
 Perfection	Usually when i watch a film i become analytical of certain aspects (ie acting, direction etc.) but on this occasion I totally became lost in the film, totally gripped by the drama and storyline. It's not often you can become lost in a film lot but this totally draws you in.Probably the best film I have ever seen and a 10 out of 10 is certainly rare by anyones standards. Not often can a film hit such a wide audience like this one can. It is truly versatile in its production.Well casted, the characters are totally believable and at no time can you doubt a reaction or performance.If you haven't seen this yet, you must watch as soon as possible!	10
 A really great film	"I only just viewed this film, which my mum said would be good watch in my revision breaks. And it is! its very hooking in the sense that you cant stop once you begun, but i had to as i did an hour of revising before hand, having 30mins of viewing time. Then i gave up revising when i had enough of this stop start routine and watched it through. And i think its influential to any type of person out there, and if you have time to watch it. As its most probable my ""now"" favourite film. As i really like horrors and sci-fi's i thought i wouldn't like this. but anything that Stephen King writes or Frank Darabont directs.I recommend this to anyone."	10
 Peace for all n great stories forever..... and they lived happily ever after		10
 deserving...?	#2 out of 250... dnt get me wrong the movie is great, but I cant imagine how this movie is so well liked. sure it has a great story line, plot, and ending. everything a good movie needs. but it is all talk. every part is predictable. i knew right from the beginning that the one new cell mate who told Andy hes innocent was going to be shot and killed. yadayadayada was all i heard for the 2hr 30 min movie. i loved it, but expected a lot more after reading the comments before watching... i don't know why, but i just expected more from this film. i just felt that it culd have gone the extra mile and be deserving of the best film ever made.	8
 Good Things Never DIE		
 This just might be the perfect movie		10
 No words can explain how good this movie is		10
 The Greatest Film to Never Win an Oscar	"Far and away, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" deserved, with every fiber of its being, to win the Best Picture Oscar for 1994. Morgan Freeman, who, until ""Million Dollar Baby,"" had been robbed of an Oscar for films such as ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" had his pinnacle performance for ""TSR."" Beautifully crafted, totally captivating, and flowing effortlessly with Freeman's narration, ""TSR,"" for all its gray colors, paints an exuberant portrait of life behind bars--the wrongly convicted Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) adapts to prison life, all the while calculating an escape that spans three decades. Keeping his friends close, and enemies closer, Dufrane takes a seemingly innocent hobby and turns it into a redemption that takes him to Mexico, with Red (Freeman) serving his time and following suit.If there is a film that speaks more to the believer in all of us, I haven't encountered it yet. It doesn't matter what hour of the evening, or what mood I'm in, if ""TSR"" is playing...I'm watching, and loving it just as much as the first time around.It's been fourteen years...if you haven't seen it, ask yourself, ""What the hell's wrong with me?"""	10
 Shawshank Redemption	This movie shows a great friendship between main characters Red and Andy. People should strive to gain an understanding and have immense respect for one another. Andy gave hope to Red throughout their friendship. I learned there is a right moment for everything, because Andy planned to escape from the prison when no one had any idea. When the warden was caught saving that money, by filing false claims, he ended up killing himself. This shows that justice seeks to find itself in the end. This movie was shocking, because no one would have thought about how Andy planned his escape. However, if you watched the movie closely you could see hints about how Andy was strategic on his every move,like a chess game is played out.	8
 A beautifully told story of friendship and hope	Andy Dufrunse (a young banker) is convicted for the murder of his wife and her secret lover, and is given a life imprisonment sentence which he will serve back to back. At Shawshank prison, he befriends the prison hustler, Red (who is known for getting things). Andy soon becomes a respected prisoner at Shawshank, he sets up the library, does tax returns for prison Warderns, helps fellow prisoners pass their collage degrees and so forth. His friendship with Red grows stronger. Red and his crew suspect that Andy is about to reach a breakdown... you will also think alike as well - given the set up of the film. But wait a minute, the film delivers a killer twist that will leave your mouth wide open... you will be amazed just how little it takes to break through toughest prison walls. I	10
 Outstanding	Best movie I have ever seen.If you did not see it you don't know what your missing out on. I can't believe I waited this long to watch this movie. But I saw it was going to be on TV tonight so I sat down and watched it. It was time well spent. The acting was excellent (especially Tim Robbins), the storyline was interesting...everything was great. As another reviewer mentioned, the time flies by when you're watching it. When the movie finished, I looked at the clock and was amazed that 3 hours had gone by. A movie about life, about freedom and about friendship. This movie is just perfect.Each time i see it, i learn something else. This movie gives you a different meaning about freedom. Great performances of Morgan Freeman	10
 Tied for my favourite film, a truly moving, inspiring masterpiece		10
 Brilliant	i just love this movie. It is a must see for absolutely everyone. even if you end up hating it you will be better off seeing it than not :) there are reasons why the film should not have worked and reasons why it should, but because of the brilliant cast and excellent directing and adaption of Stephen kings novella this has become one of the best films ever created and is superb in its entirety. i remember watching it for the first time when i was about 15 years old and it had been recorded and i missed the ending of the film, it cut out just after Andy fell out of the sewage pipe in his escape. I couldn't believe it, i had to spend ages trying to attain a copy of the film so i could finish watching it and well it as definitely worth it :) i have given this film a 10/10 and deservedly so. it is inspiring and brilliant	10
 Excellent film	The 'The Shawshank Redemption' is one of the best film ever made!!!Personally i think it is the number one not far away from other great films.What i love on this film is that it shows how people can reach freedom and happiness even when they are desperate. It shows that there is always a hope and anybody can reach his dream if he believes in himself...When i first watched the movie i was very surprised with the happy ending.I almost cried. I also liked the Morgan Freeman's description that makes the story more attractive. Other things i like on the film is that it 'talks' about life's simple and important values such as friendship , partnership , fellow feelings and simple moments of life enjoy.	10
 Amazing! One Of The Best Movies Ever!	"This movie was nothing short of amazing. I had watched it a couple years after it came out but I rented it recently and I have watched it over and over. The acting is amazing, the suspense is great and the events in the movie are gut wrenching, tear jerking and sometimes even stomach turning. This movie shows you what some prisons can be like in some places at different points in time. The cast is great, with Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who is sentenced to 2 back to back 20 year life sentences for ""murdering his wife"", Morgan Freeman as Ellis Boyd 'Red'Redding, an old man who has done years for a murder he committed when he was a teenager, Andy and Red become good friends in prison, there is also Clancy Brown who plays Captain Byron T. Hadley, a vicious prison guard with no remorse or conscience, and Bob Gunton plays Warden Samuel Norton, a crooked prison warden. I highly recommend this movie to anyone fit to watch a movie so disturbing in scenes. So go out and buy this movie, you don't even have to rent it to see if you like it, trust me, you will. I'd buy it but it isn't exactly an easy one to find here.10/10--Amazing..Highly Recommended"	10
 A favourite	Love it!!! What more can I say?! I love the storyline, the ending - not what I expected. Strong and intense performances from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Shawshank is a classic. Captivating and so moving with so little in the way of action. Morgan Freeman putting in brilliantly scripted, brilliantly acted narrative. A film with many emotions which pulls you in from start to finish. Genius Film making of the highest standard with some standout performances. A impressive, engrossing piece of film-making. Very good performances. Simple story but well told. An altogether truly brilliant film. A very watchable, well shot movie.	10
 Very Excellent!		10
 A Truly Awe Inspiring Film - A Masterpiece		10
 One of the best movies of all times!	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most well written, played and directed movies of all time. Incredibly humane and realistic, it will keep the viewers interest at top throughout the whole movie without making him tired, will travel him in the same journey with the actors and leave him after the end with a sweet taste in his heart and his mind. ""Fear can set you prisoner, Hope can set you free"" claims the movie and you will really believe it. This is only one of the many massages the movie is sending. The story is so real that is breathtaking. The acting is excellent from all the actors, even in secondary roles. It is a movie that I enjoy to watch at any time, touching me each time. It is really a classic masterpiece!"	10
 amazing	this film is possibly one of the greatest all time, anyone who watches and thinks it is bad, they need shooting, love this film and can watch it loads of times and not get bored. upsetting at some points but still amazing. Morgan Freeman's character Red loved, him, he saw things on a different side, and a more realistic side, whereas, Andy saw things as a more fantasising which he always believed could come true. There are points in the film which many would say, i have seen this before or we all know wot is going to happen, but in this film, you never know wot to expect, there are many points which are very unexpected. To end this, my word on it is amazing, i loved the film, and if this is not considered one of the best films of all time then i don't know what could be.	10
 Feel Like Your There		9
 The Magic Of Movie making captured in all it's glory.	"I must have seen this movie over twenty times, and every time i watch it feels like the first time i'm watching it. words escape me in describing how good this movie is, and i dare say that ""The Godfather"" became second on my list because of it. Simply Amazing, simply invigorating, simply a masterpiece. If the 20th century's best piece of art was to be searched for, then search no more. This is the definitive piece of art that movie makers should look up to. The minimum length for a comment is 10 lines, but what more can i put down to describe such a movie. i own four copies of this movie 2 regular edition DVDs and 2 Special Editions. do i need to say more. Do yourself a favor and acquire a copy, you'll be glad you did."	10
 One of the best movies ever!	All the things that could have been said about this movie, have been said. I honestly can't understand why this movie didn't won the Best Picture of '94. Knowing that Forrest Gump is a good movie and Pulp Fiction a great movie. But both can't match the story told in The Shawshank Redemption.Showing similarities to The Green Mile with Tom Hanks, this movie tells a story about hope, dreams and friendships. Furthermore it shows how ex-cons struggle with the new world, once they get out of prison. I'm grateful that Tom Hanks didn't take the role of Andy Dufrense, as he was the first choice for the role. Not that he wouldn't have done a good job, but Tim Robbins belongs to this role. Just as Tom Hanks belongs to the role of Paul Edgecomb in The Green Mile.Every single plot in the movie gets equal attention and could be a movie on its own. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman never played better in any of their movies. The rest of the actors are also very good. The story in this film is simple, but the way it's told makes it perfect. Not many movies can tell such a simple story with such class. Therefore this is one of the best films, but also one of the best stories ever told on film.	
 One of the best movies ever		9
 Beautiful And Stunning A True Masterpiece Of Cinema	Rarely do movies come along that change a persons perspective on life, but for The Shawshank Redemption this statement is granted. From start to finish a beautiful adaptation of what movies are supposed to be like, displaying humanities most important elements, hope, joy, retribution and redemption, they all come into play and thats what makes it a cut above the rest. Society changes views on certain aspects of life but somehow hope always stays at the forefront, for change, for a better life. To change ones situation and to free the soul of a prison of emotion. Shawshank doesn't have special effects or big blockbuster openings and endings, but it does have one thing that is more deep and special, it has a message that appeals to the good in everyone, that no ones situation is indefinite and that where there's hope, there's life.	10
 The Greatest Movie I've ever seen	I've seen some of the most famous movies of all time Ben-Hur, Lawrence of Arabia, On the Waterfront, Gone with the Wind, etc; But this is my all time favorite movie, Morgan Freeman is unbelievable as Red, same goes for Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, This is a Movie about a man named Andy Dufresne who is imprisoned for not 1... but 2 life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, while in prison he meets a fellow inmate by the name of Ellis Boyd Redding mostly known as Red. And they go through so much together, the ending makes me so happy inside that Andy and Red are able to meet on the outside and live the rest of the lives on the outside.	10
 A good, but not great, film		8
 The Best	"This is one of the most moving, beautiful movies I've ever seen. You can feel the desperation and the hope. I encourage everyone to see it. The language can be a little graphic, but is probably appropriate for a movie such as this. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are surrounded by outstanding character actors who only enhance their performances. They add something to every scene. My favorite scene is that of ""Andy"" and ""Red"" discussing Mexico and the character of Andy sums up the whole movie with the line, ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". I've always loved this movie and watch it on TV whenever it's showing. I finally bought the 10 years anniversary DVD addition."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption. Long life.	What can one say about the Shawshank Redemption that hasn't already been said. I remember when it came out but refused to see it because of the title although I am a big fan of both stars. Besides, I had gotten so burned by critics saying that this movie is a four star or that one only to go and see them and find that the movies mentioned were ordinary or most certainly not the four stars the critics gave them. Even Roger Ebert is guilty of this. So, because of bad information I usually wait for the DVD to come out and that's too bad because I'm denying a good movie some money it could use in it's theatrical release. But so many movies coming out just isn't worth my money. I saw the Shawshank Redemption in rental and turned around and bought a copy. I like prison movies anyway from the TV movie Against the Wall, the story about Attica to the Chicano epic Bound by Honor to the great OZ my all time favorite prison story. The Shawshank Redemption transcends most prison movies because it has heart and is told in such a leisurely fashion that you can absorb it and enjoy the art and superb dialog and the brilliant acting without feeling hurried. Many posters have already commented on this wonderful movie and although I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever made I do enjoy it and am glad that it's in my library.	10
 No bad one time in life but all the way bad in a bad life	I've watched more than 5 or 6 times I guess and whenever it appears on any TV channel. The characters, everything about them, height, weight, age and even the race or education was set properly and perfect. I'd always get the imagination that I'm watching some footage taken on real time and during the daily life of the people live in a prison. They were so real and the theme was not a fictitious one and may anytime happen to any of us anywhere and we shall fing ourselves in a situation like in this film. The part about himself, the sentence he said about being a crook was wonderful and explained all what about thw film is. This is all what I can say about the film.	10
 Inspiring.	"Shawshank Redemption is truly an inspirational film--a work of art. What makes this film so special (asside from the excellent acting from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins) is the message of hope, even in your darkest hours. Robbins plays a man sent to jail for a crime he did not commit--the murder of his wife and her lover. He is found guilty, and sent to Shawshank Penitentiary. He meets Freeman, who has spent most of his life in Shawshank for a crime he committed when he was a young, dumb kid. Freeman feels that Robbins wouldn't last past his first night in prison. But after being repeatedly sodomized by ""the sisters"" and manipulated by the warden, Robbins remains resilient and hopeful. He gains Freeman's respect as well as his friendship. The men go through three decades of unhappiness as the pinup on Robbin's wall changes from Rita Hayworth to Marilyn Monroe to Racquel Welsch. Each one hiding a secret that grows bigger, with time. Something that Robbins doesn't even confide in his best friend Freeman.After one final betrayal from the warden, we find out what those posters were hiding...The gateway to Robbins' freedom. I'll spoil no more for you...but recommend you watch this film yourself. It's quite inspiring and uplifting.9/10"	8
 Simply Beautiful.	"Beautiful. Simply Beautiful. The essence of this movie captures u from the beginning to the end. I found myself emotionally attached to the characters in this movie. I don't believe anyone could ever surpass the true, ""essence"" of The Shawshank Redemption. The game that Morgan Freeman brings to the table can't be surpassed with his calm-demeanor narration and always stunning acting and capturing of the true character of ""Red"" in the movie. The friendship that Red and Andy make also will capture your heart. The mysterious Andy DuFresne is played beautifully by Tim Robbins. Other characters such as Warden Norton, Brooks Hatlen, Haywood, Byron Hadley, Tommy, and all the others, are also beautifully played by their actors. The story is clearly presented in old-fashioned way that will capture you, like i said, from the BEGINNING."	10
 A True masterpiece and simply the best!	"The Best film ever made. A true masterpiece and an epic that will never be beaten. The acting is of the highest standard with some excellent and true quotes, such as ""It comes down a simple choice, really. Either get busy living, or get busy dying,"" and the story line is fantastic with the most amazing end to the film, that leaves you in astonishment. Morgan freeman plays his role to the highest standard and it is definitely his best film in his career. I am a huge film lover, but I have to say i have never seen a film that touched me quite as much as the Shawshank did! If you haven't seen this film, I promise you now, you are missing the best film of all time."	10
 Excellently Excellent	This has got to be my favourite movie of all time. i watched it a few years ago for the first time on a rental copy and HAD to buy it! I've watched it many times since! the cast and crew are superb! I don't think i could imagine anyone else playing any part in this, they all did they're job brilliantly! Film is about a guy who gets wrongly accused of killing his wife in a revenge style attack and gets sent to prison for life. Through-out the time he spent there, he came across enemies, friends and people he could use as an advantage for his plans. In the end, the people that thought they knew Andy realised that they did'not know what he was capable of after all.I recommend this film to anyone.10/10	10
 My new favorite movie		10
 Uplifting and Inspirational	"Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the ""man who can get things."" Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail. Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time."	10
 a brilliant movie	"When I read the back of the DVD in the store I thought to myself several times. Why bother this is just another prison movie. But eventually I had no excuses left not to buy this DVD I heard great reviews about it. Yet I still settled myself down for another movie. After watching the movie for 30 minutes I was already starting to wonder why on earth I hadn't bought the DVD of this movie sooner. And the first thing I did when the movie ended. was playing it again. The fact of the matter is that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the few movies of the last decade or so that you can actually watch over and over again without getting that feeling of ""I already know how it's gonna end"".This movie is a must see for everyone and deserves nothing less than a 10 out of 10..."	10
 more errors in the movie	first off, excellent movie. great characters. second, when Andy breaks the sewer pipe during the escape, crap shoots out. That is possible only if the pipe was plugged up and under pressure. Even then the pipe would still be full of crap up to the hole after that loss of pressure. yet the pipe was fully empty when Andy looked in. Also, the only pipe that can drain directly into the river is a rain/storm drain pipe. Crap will come from only the sewer pipe which means that Andy would had have ended up in a septic tank which is what most likely be used in such a rural area. third, how the hell did Andy fit into warden's clothes/shoes???? how did Andy cut out the bible pages so perfectly to fit the rock hammer? how come nobody got visitors? Who is Allen Greene in whose memory this movie of?	10
" ""Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free"""		10
 Every second of this movie is spectacular.		10
 Tells a powerful story well, but I wish it allowed more development of supporting characters	"I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" last night with my husband, partly to see what the fuss was all about. I found it a well made moving film, but a little too sentimental. Red's character was complex. He was very noble (well, he is played by Morgan Freeman) but he was in prison for being a murderer, and the speech he made to the parole board at the end of the film showed his dilemmas and the darker side of his personality. Andy was complex too as the other prisoners saw. I thought the characters were too clichéd in the way that the warden and the guards were bad, the prisoners were good, except for a group of prisoners (the Sisters) who were bad. Aside from Andy and Red, the characters fit clearly on one side of the good/bad divide. I would have liked to see more sides of their personalities. The film delivers some surprises by the end: it was wonderful not to have any inkling of Andy's escape, his plans for revenge, or his gift to Red, providing Red with his freedom. The script develops the story skillfully and makes the audience care deeply about the prisoners, not just Andy and Red. I would have liked to know what happened to the prisoners after the corrupt warden and the bullying guards were arrested. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" tells a powerful story well, but it would have an even more powerful punch if it allowed more time to discover the prisoners' inner natures: the darker tone of the ""fishing"" scenes at the start really isn't returned to. I loved Banks' pet crow and the nod to ""Birdman of Alcatraz"". That film was a strong portrait of both the Birdman and the experience of being in a prison. Ultimately, I didn't feel that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" gives a picture of what it's like to be a prisoner locked away in a corrupt institution for decades. For one thing, I can't see an entire population of a prison reacting to Mozart on the loudspeaker with awe: surely there must have been more prisoners who prefer Hank Williams."	9
 best movie I've ever seen...	at the first time I saw the movie, I had a high expectation on this movie, due to its position in IMDb.com..then, I watched this movie, expecting what is called one of the best movies ever, and when the credits came up...I was speechless...indeed, this movie looks simple, and sentimental... nevertheless, I have to admit its perfection..in terms of pacing, music, acting, movie length, twist, and ending...I've been comparing this movie to other movies around, still I find this better than those...even the classic ones...I'm still looking for another contender for the best movie ever, but yet, this movie still tops all of them...11 out of 10	10
 The Best Film Ever Made	Quite simply the best film it has been my pleasure to have watched. When it first came out at the cinema in the mid nineties, it wasn't tremendously successful, however as a regular cinema goer at the time, I was lucky enough to see this magnificent film. As soon as I left the cinema, I promptly recommended this film to everyone I knew. As soon as the video and then the DVD was released, it was purchased immediately and watched and re-watched several times. Even though I know the entire storyline and all the twists etc, I still watch the film whenever it comes on TV. I still watch the DVD at least a couple of times a year, some would call it sad, however it totally deserves the title of 'My Favourite Film'	10
 Ending	A very, very good film. Yet it only gets a nine. The ending of Andy sanding the boat is too cheesy. Red setting off into the distance on the bus was enough. Definitely one to watch multiple times though. Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Now go down to your nearest retailer and buy a copy now !!! Trust me, you'll be glad you did. I am so glad film four is free now in the UK. Another film i'm looking forward to is Trainspotting. A most excellent film. The best film to have come out of the UK in years. Running out of stuff to say. Just had to voice my depression at the ending... so there ya go .	9
 Best Movie ever!	"Stephen King rocks! Not only can he terrify us with his stories of the macabre, BUT he can also dazzle us and bring us to tears with his dramas, such as the Green Mile, Stand by Me (The Body), Hearts in Atlantis, Dolores Claiborne and YES...THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION! This movie is my favorite because the ending (last 25 minutes) just keeps getting better and better and by the last few minutes you think it's going to end and you want more to happen to make it the best happy ending possible and it IS. It keeps going until all characters get their comeuppances, good or bad! This is a movie about HOPE. As King entitled this part of the novel Different Seasons ""Hope Springs Eternal""! A++++++++++"	10
 Prison Life in the 40's and 50's was a story of survival.	"Shawshank Redemption is one of the most insightful and thought provoking movies I have seen. With the character ""Red's"" narration, it comes across a little like a documentary because of the details of prison life presented. But we are being told a story in such a way as to keep us interested enough to hear the outcome.I view the character, Andy (at least later in the movie) as an undetected mouse in a board meeting or fly on the wall who observes more than the average person. Red describes him as wearing some kind of cloak that shields him from the effects of the prison. This is revealed as hope later on. Andy somehow refuses to allow his hope to be crushed or snuffed out.He accomplishes so much during his incarceration, much of it due to his undaunted perseverance and redirected energy. It is brilliant and insanely brave when he asks the guard if he trusts his wife. Pushed to the brink of destruction, he barely gets the words out to the effect that the guard can keep all of the inheritance if he gifts it to his wife.The story reminds me of the Biblical Joseph in an Egyptian prison, a documented instance of undeserved confinement.The spoiler that I have for those already initiated is: Andy places his own copy of the Bible in the warden's safe the evening of his planned escape. The warden is mocked when he reads his own quote to Andy inside the cover and the hollow for the pick-ax is revealed. I wonder if Andy's routine included locking up the warden's Bible, or was this a one time sting for the warden's sake?"	10
 worth watching over and over	I loved the plot in this movie. Throughout this movie i felt like i was Andy. I wasn't watching Andy, i was Andy. And Morgan freeman was my best friend. This only says that the acting was superb. This movie is always on TV and though i don't think i have watched the whole thing one time through, i have seen all of it in different parts at least 30 times, and each time i long that i haven't seen the movie from start to finish. So i recommend all to buy it, as its something i need to go out and do myself. Mordan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time and after seeing this movie, you will believe so. This movie is defiantly in my top 5 list. The only movies i would say have better acting is the first to god fathers.	10
 AFI is for pansies...		10
 Well loved classic		9
 Never Saw it Coming	In all honesty, this was one of the biggest surprises I'd seen in the movies in a long time. This is also one of the few movies that I can safely say that the majority of well minded individuals will find entertaining. But now, into the actual content of the film. For starters, the opening sequence with the imperial walkers is not only one of my favorite cinema memories; it's also a staple point in the advancement of sci-fi films. Though the love story may have seemed a bit trite to some, I found it tasteful and appropriate. Once again, I was blown away with the final light saber sequence and though I won't spoil it, let's just say that a very important character drops one spicy meatball.	9
 best movie	"One of the best movies I have ever seen, well acted, directed, everything was perfect. . the movie is about a escape from jail. but it was totally different from other movies like ""the great escape"" ""escape from Alcartaz"" . the shaw shank redemption is a different movie in a sense that, its not only about a escape. its classic, emotionally inspiring,its about a hope(""Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free"". .then The twist that makes you worth watching it all along and leaves you with tremendous wonder. It's a good thing though, even for those of you who is too dumb to watch character driven drama and prefer mindless action movies. Tim Robbins and Morgen freeman were great. fine performances without the use of a lot of violence or graphic violence to get attention."	9
 How do you know a movie is one of the greatest?	"Since ""The Shawshank Redemption"" was released in 1994, it has been played on various cable channels (TNT, TBS, etc) approximately 130,842 times. You know what: it keeps getting better and better. If the cable networks developed a Shawshank channel, it would consistently receive higher cable ratings than any other channel (even if they played the pan and scan version, instead of the widescreen). The movie is that good.Every element of the film is near perfect. I have watched the movie in its entirety at least 10 times and I get something new from it each time. Watch this movie. I repeat. WATCH THIS MOVIE."	10
 The Greatest Film of All Time.	"I wrote my first review of this movie back in 2006. I feel I did not do it the justice it deserved.I grew up in Mansfield, OH, not very far at all from the Ohio State Reformatory. The old ""castle Dracula"" Administration building is all that is left now. A new prison (Mansfield Correctional Institution) was built on the site where the other buildings existed along OH-13. I remember the impending demolition just waiting for this movie to finish filming......Thank God it waited! The story begins in 1946 when Portland banker Andy Dufresne is tried for and wrongfully convicted of the double murder of his wife and her ""lover"".Andy arrives at Shawshank state prison in early 1947 and is greeted harshly by ruthless authority and by thugs who seem to enjoy beating him up. Andy keeps strong and keeps very much to himself for the first two years.Andy finally decides he needs a hobby to keep his mind occupied. He approaches the well known prison entrepenour, ""Red"", and asks if Red might smuggle something into the prison for him... This kick starts the relationship between Red and Andy that the movie centers its attention on.There is a gentle tug of war between the two regarding ideals. Red, guilty of murder and sentenced to life with parole, sees no hope in existence outside of the prison walls. He tries, throughout the film, to convey to Andy that ""hope can drive a man insane"" and its best to just accept your fate. Opposites must attract because Andy was Red's polar opposite and it began to catch Red's attention. Andy would confront the police guard to ask for beers for his friends. He'd play music over the Shawshank PA system from the Warden's office. He'd write the state once or twice a week for years and years to get funds for a new library. Andy Dufresne dared to dream and he turned the negativity of Shawshank on its head...and just may have changed Red's view on things.The villain in the movie is Warden Norton. The Warden notices Andy's skills and intelligence early on and took full advantage. He entices Andy to be sort of an ""administrative assistant"". He started out in doing tax returns for the guards, which he was very good at. In time, the Warden enticed him to use his banking skills to mastermind a money laundering scheme that would make the Warden ""a millionaire when he retires"". Andy had to ""go to prison to be a crook"". This kept his mind occupied.About 2/3 the way through the film, a young kid is admitted to Shawshank who knows who killed Andy's wife 19 years before. Andy is ecstatic and he takes the news to the Warden. At risk of the money laundering scandel being brought to light, the Warden ensures Andy he's not leaving Shawshank. Andy gets two months in the hole. The young kid gets shot.Andy, the beacon of hope for this movie, decides HE WILL get out. And HE WILL get his freedom.We go back to Andy's first meeting with Red 19 years before the escape...the little chess piece chiseling 6"" rock hammer that he asked for... He'd been chipping away at the concrete wall in his room for 19 years and NOBODY SAW IT COMING.Andy busts out of that stinkin place, crawls through a 500 yard sanitary line and ""comes out clean on the other side"". Andy is gone and is free like a bird.Red, with his inspirational friend gone, does begin to lose that hope that Andy almost convinced him of. Life at the prison begins to suck. Red, after 40 years, gets paroled. He has no idea how to adapt on the outside. He might just commit suicide.Only one thing stops him...a promise he made to Andy... Determined, Red puts on his hat and suit, clamps his travel case shut. Give busy livin, or get busy dyin...thats god damn right. He bolts town and meets up with Andy on the beach in Mexico. Red, once a young crook, now redeemed old man."	10
 One of Frank Darabont's BEST!!	This is a fantastic film and deserved the countless awards that it was given during the 1990's! The film is visually astounding with a fantastic cast of legendary actors. Films that have twists are always impressive and Frank Darabont does this film justice by creating an original and at times, very moving screenplay. I would suggest that anyone watches this film as it takes its audience on a roller-coaster of emotions from pity towards Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) at the start of this movie when he is convicted of murdering his wife, to the moving performance by James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen, the lonely and 'institutionalised' old prisoner. The ending made me cry and made me want to go and visit the 'big hayfield up near Buxton'!! I must have watched this film hundreds of times and I still get nervous when Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) goes into Andy Dufresne's cell and realises something astounding about the prisoner...	
 Without a doubt, one of the greatest ever		10
 One of the best movies ever made	"If you can't watch a movie which doesn't contain any explosions, wild car chases or corrupt cops, then this movie probably isn't for you. However, if you enjoy a good story with great acting and execution, then you really should look into ""The Shawshank Redemption"".So why is the movie so good? The movie as a whole is simply breath-taking. In addition to the exceptional story, everything is ""just right"". I've seen loads of movies with good stories, but most of them seem to fail in other aspects (poor acting, poor camera-work and such) making the movie as a whole not live up to its potential. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is NOT one of them. It actually manages to pull it off, resulting in what I deem to be one of the best movies ever made. I give it a 10/10, without any hesitation."	10
 If you haven't watched it, i am begging you to...	I thought i've watched some really great movies in my life. The ironic thing is, every time i watch a movie that is great, i'll miss much of it because the TV is busy advertising some rubbish prime time movie like charlies angels.Shawshank redemption is not a good movie, it's a GREAT movie. Thankfully, i got the DVD and finally watched it from start to finish. I've never watched a show that made me feel like watching over and over and over again like it has. The way the director captures human emotion, makes this one hell of a great prison movie.The movie is great at the start, but none better when it comes closer to the end. Believe me, there will be a point your jaw will just hang open in amazement. I love this movie, if you've not watched it, please do so...	10
 Brilliant	Some individuals get bored with the beginning of the movie because of the slow pace, but one has to remember this isn't about action its about drama and a well told story, and the ending makes me smile every time. The well chosen dialog in the start shows the viewer this is not about your normal prison movie or any sorta of manner that could be included in that genre, but instead has well thought out banter. The cinematography is nothing new to any of us but thats not so important as the story and the way the angles show what need to be shown. Simplely put its a beautiful story, well written by King and is shot and made very worth peoples while. My mother watched it for the very first time a few weeks ago, before always complaining that it was boring and she could never get into it, now she sings it praise.	10
" ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"""	"""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free."" What a great tag line. It makes you think of how good your life is when you get to be free.It is hard for me to put my feelings into words because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of that kind of movies that makes you think. The movie has been very educating for me.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not an ordinary prison-movie. It is an epic story about friendship. I almost start to weep when I think of Red (outstanding Morgan Freeman) and Andy's (excellent Tim Robbins) strong relationship! In the film Tim Robbins' character, banker Andy Dufresne is being accused to have murdered his wife and his lover while they were having an intimate moment. The jury finds the defendant guilty as charged and Andy is sent to the infamous Shawshank prison which was known for its cruel punishments for misbehaving. While being a new meet in prison Andy is being harassed by the Sisters, inmates who want to taste some of that fresh meet. Everything happens on Red's point of view. Red is the guy who can get almost anything you want by smuggling stuff in. He is a provider who will someday give Andy the key; Rita Hayworth.The film is full of injustice but even if you are locked up you can find your soul-mates. Also after being imprisoned for a long time it will grow on you. It becomes your home. But not for Andy. He knows he's innocent. Maybe the Shawshank isn't so hard to crack...""The Shawshank Redemption"" is based on a short story by no other than king of horror Stephen King. I have found his prison-movies to be very very good because, well, the pictures about his stories have always been little downbeat. Maybe because of the supernatural side, I guess. I have this short story on my bookshelf and it's almost as same as the movie. The only thing's that different in the short story is that Red was a ginger-haired, white Irishman. Freeman's Red is also Irish but we all know the difference. It doesn't make any difference, really.The lesson of this movie is to never give up hope. Life can sure kick you but kick back. Be smarter than life.""I hope I can get across the border. I hope to see my friend, and shake his hand. I hope that the Pasific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."" -Red"	10
 Fear can hold you Prisoner, Hope can set you Free	I doubt anyone can argue, that this Movie is the greatest one ever made. If there is no better movie ever made I will not be disappointed. More about that later though, one of the movie's strongest aspects, the acting.Before watching this movie I had never heard of Tim Robbins, and after was left wondering why, the way he developed the character of Andrew Dufresne was incredible, why he hasn't been in many, many more big productions.But the real star in this Movie was Morgan Freeman,maybe it was because he's Irish, his role as Red the 'The man who knows how to get things' was incredible. A convicted murderer, and the only guilty man in shawshank really was what made the movie, amongst other things, so good. He would have to be the best narrator EVER!! he makes you feel as though when he speaks, you're him watching the events unfold as they happen from his perspective.The other co-stars all put in great performances, notabley Bob Gunton as the Warden, William Sadler as Heywood a fellow inmate and James Whitmore as Brooks. Clancy Brown did a great job of making you hate his character Captain Hadley, at some parts you just wanted reach through the screen and kill him yourself. And Mark Rolsten as Boggs the gay prisoner, made you shudder.But the highlight of the acting was on the on screen chemistry between Tim Robbins and Morgn Freeman the best male lead duo that I have ever seen, the way they inspire each other and the conversations they share add another dimension to the movie.The plot is good, with the ending coming as a complete surprise to me, probably because i was expecting something a little different to what I had expected, which is what makes this movie brilliant. Frank Darabout has done a great job as Director as he has shown us again later in the Green Mile. I cant believe this film did not perform in the Cinemas or did not win any awards. Words cannot possibley describe in detail just how good this movie is, go and see it for yourself, but be prepared for some real, prison violence. And remember, a good thing never dies.	10
 Excellent: an inspiring tale of hope and redemption		9
 Get busy living, or get busy dying...		9
 excellent	"This movie is by far the best movie i've seen in my life, i'm only 18 mind, but still, excellent, i would recommend that anyone who hasn't seen it watch it. The actors really play convincing parts, even the minor roles are played out well. I really can't say a bad thing about this movie. I wouldn't want to spoil the movie for someone who hasn't seen it. All i can say is watch it!! this movie should not in anyway be turned down because ""it is just a prison movie"" this movie is much more than this...It is really cheep as well, if you want to buy it in HMV i bought it from there for £1.99 which i thought was an absolute bargain!! go buy it for yourself now if you haven't got it!!"	10
 A must see for any serious Movie Lover	"One of my favorite all time movies!I've watched it at least 12 times and enjoy it as much each time I see it. One of the best adaptations and truest to the original Stephen King stories that I have seen. The other being ""The Green Mile"". The combination of musical score with the well written and delivered lines of Morgan Freemans narration still can well the tears up in my eyes. His narration and acting in this film surely should have garnered him an Academy Award! He's an American Icon in my book. Superbly written, superbly directly, superbly filmed, and superbly acted. You'll never be disappointed to have this DVD in your collection."	10
 One of the best of all time	"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and I will probably watch it a dozen more. It is a feel good movie with excellent acting. I am a huge Tim Robbins fan and Morgan Freeman does a superb job as ""the man who can get things"". The majority of the supporting cast were just as good. The storyline is honest and fun. I believe most people will enjoy what this film has to offer. If you think you might be turned off because this is a prison movie please reconsider. I doubt that once you've seen the movie you will consider it a cliché prison flick. Most movies today are entirely too predictable. This movie is guaranteed to surprise and excite as the plot and ending unfold."	10
 A masterpiece	If this movie isn't a masterpiece, then nothing is. The story and the actors feel very real and they just charm you from the very beginning. You can feel all the emotions that appear in the movie, when something is unfair you just want to break an expensive object and when something good happens you sit there, smiling like a little sun. Tim Robbins is excellent for the part of Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman couldn't have been a better choice for the speaker and the role itself.Even though the movie is full of surprises it allows you to figure out a few things yourself every now and then. But in the long run it consists of many unbelievable twists and turns and there's just not one boring second. I'm not surprised about the rating either, this movie just deserves to be as high up on all lists as a movie possibly can be. If you haven't seen it, you know what I want you to do next.	9
 A Groundbreaking Masterpiece		10
 Potentially one of the finest movies of all time		10
 My Personal Best		10
 Greatest Masterpiece Ever Filmed.	"The only movie I've ever rated a '10', Reference Standard.Regardless of my own interpretation of this art, I say ""Greatest Masterpiece Ever Filmed."" with confidence based on the numbers and insightful comments posted by other viewers. Indeed, it is only a matter of time before this movie surpasses 'The Godfather' as being rated as the 'Top All-Time' movie on the top movie website.With that said, there is nothing I can add to the hundreds of comments posted before me. Everything about this piece from the rich story and character development to the symphonic climax should be studied by anyone interested in film. You simply must view this movie--and view it with a critical eye--as a reference standard of quality story telling."	10
 The Longest Film I've Ever Seen		10
 Deep movie about hope		9
 The Greatest	An emotional story of how nothing can break the human spirit. A truly deeply effective story about the relationship between a new prisoner and a cynical lifer. Morgan Freeman's performance is one of the best in cinema history. And Tim Robbin's portrayal of a wrongly convicted man is played to a tee. This is one of the most perfect casts ever to be set in a movie. Every actor in the movie plays their part perfectly. This movie is undeniably powerful of how prison can take your life, your freedom but there is one one thing they can't get to, that they can't touch, hope. If you only see one movie for the rest of your life make it this one. You will not be disappointed.	10
 Hope springs eternal, it truly sets you free in this movie		10
 Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time		9
 Simply Brilliant	If I watch a film and I am unable to look away for one second, to me that means the film is simply brilliant. I could not turn away from the screen when i was watching The Shawshank Redemption and it is a film that you must see. It contains a powerful message and is a very strong film. From start to finish you get right into it and is a tear jerking film in some aspect. The acting is great and Morgan Freeman is as perfect as ever. The reason why I love this film is because the message is powerful and teaches you something important which not many films do. The plot is that a man is wrongly accused of murder and is sent to Shawshank Prison. His dream is then to break out and along the way encounters some heartbreaking moments but fails to fall and continues to fight on.	10
 Simply excellent	There is a scene early in the movie when the viewer is introduced for the first time to Shawshank prison. The camera takes us on an extraordinary panorama, beginning at ground level and rising up until we see the inmates crowding around like ants. It must have been shot with a sky-crane or something because there is no break in continuity. The view just goes on, up and around in a breathtaking cycle. The effect is reminiscent of the 360 degree battlefield panorama of Rod Stieger's Napoleon in 'Waterloo'. It is almost arrogant, except that it's wonderful. From this point on, I knew I was about to watch something very, very special.The film depicts the institutional brutality that sadly continues to be the hallmark or imprisonment, and how one comes to terms with it, or not. We quickly discover what happens to those who don't. Some hysterical white-collar inmate cracks-up and is beaten to death on his first night. It is a monstrous example of the ironically named 'correctional facility' at work.Morgan Freeman is another actor as remarkable for his voice as his other abilities. He is perfectly chosen as narrator.For almost 2 hours we endure the gloomy, threatening claustrophobia that makes up much of prison time, and what inmates do to gain some little respect and make life endurable. In this regard it has a lot in common with 'Midnight Express'. Except that here we are dealing with an innocent man.Music scores are perfectly chosen. The sound effects equally well matched. The viewer is taken upon a journey so complete and plausible - assisted by strong acting and excellent script - that when the extremely unlikely escape is discovered, we are left believing that too.The idea that a thunderstorm should fortuitously arrive at the very hour of need to mask the sounds of hammering, and that it would be possible to find sufficient air in the enclosed sewer-pipe, both stretch our credence a little.My favourite moment features the abscondment-on-parole of Red, who goes in search of a certain Field with a certain tree. After so long steeped in the dank, evil reek of prison one can almost smell the scents of summer, the mown hay. All is silent except for the whir of insects and distant birdsong as soft sunlight filters down through trees. The contrast is perfect, the ambiance tangible. These are surely the things to savour most when freed from permanent brutality.This, and the movie 'Fried Greeen Tomatoes' seem to perfectly counterpoint each other. They are both of equal quality and address parallels of endurance and relationships from male or female perspectives. I love 'em both as much.I'm told that each bombed at the box-office. Not enough pyrotechnics and CGI effects I guess.If you haven't seen either of them; get busy. But watch them on a decent telly with a quality independent sound-system.	9
 a rare gem	'The Shawshank Redemption' is a prison film and a good film about characters. The film is about a man who is put into prison for murdering his wife, a crime that he did not commit. He ends up helping the prison guards out, and some complicated issues arise. The film is about characters, loyalty, revenge, and freedom. This film is one of its kind; it is almost spiritual as it touches on many different aspects of life. The story is thoroughly engaging as are the characters, and the different situations that the characters are in keep the viewer guessing and hungry for more. This film is a rare gem that lives up to its expectations.	8
 If you haven't seen this film watch it now. Forget about work or exams or what ever, watch it.		10
 Moving and hopeful	This movie touched me, but I'm finding it hard to review.It is the story of a man who, after being convicted to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, still manages to find hope and a reason to live. We see him first come to grips with the way his life is, then we see him begin to see how he could change it for the better.It is full of memorable characters who each have something to share with us if we are willing to listen. It will make you angry when an injustice is revealed, it will make you smile at a small bit of good fortune and even the hardest hearted person would have a hard time not shedding a tear during certain scenes.Redemtion is possible and may be right around the corner!	9
 What a great way to spend two hours on your backside	WOW what a great way to spend two hours on your backside - This is one of the greatest films ever made. I love all of it, Tim Robbins acting fighting the skinheads, teaching the inmates, helping with the guards finances, and digging the tunnel a wonderfully written part and a self crafted bit genius from Morgan Freeman made this film sparkle! GREAT FILM! please watch it... I think the prison warden looks like Graham 'turinp' Taylor the ex England Soccer Manager! funny - I love the shoes joke at the end very good. It did remind me a little of other films when Morgan Freeman leaves prison. But Tim on his boat at the very end is a smile raiser!	9
 A wrongfully accused banker goes through the trials of prison life while trying to hold the hope of living free again.	"This movie does an excellent job of portraying all characters in this movie and showing how each individual deals with the fact/probability that they might never see life outside of prison walls, while also showing how certain inmates manage to handle freedom once being let out of prison. A truly inspirational movie showing the strength of hope and willpower while not being too extremely over the top and using an ending to make all viewers feel good about how everything resolves itself and lets viewers have the entire story come full circle with a true sense of irony at the very end. An awesome film that is well directed with an excellent ""mood"" surrounding the entire movie. The acting keeps right up with and for the most part exceeds the directing."	10
 A Truly Captivating, Uplifting and Important Masterpiece	Captivating, Uplififting and Important are three adjectives most appropriate for this picture. Captivating as this film did literally hold me captive under Morgan Freeman's spellbinding narration in addition to his sublime acting from Freeman, Tim Robbins and the supporting cast. Uplifting as this film truly made hope spring eternal and has done for film-lovers across the globe. Finally this picture is important as there are many people in this world who have given up hope, are denigrated and dejected and may even feel that there life has no purpose but this film has renewed life to many people. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne(Robbins) who is convicted of murdering his wife and sent to Shawshank Prison for life and forms an unlikely friendship and bond with Red(Freeman) and his gang, who initially reject him, that's all I'll prefer to tell you of the film to maximise it's impact.	10
 A thing of beauty........	Perhaps the most perfect film ever made. Words simply cannot express how much I love it. The dialogue is wonderful on the ear, the soundtrack actually story enhancing, the cinematography expansive, the direction sublime, and the actors - simply perfection. All of the characters in this film were endlessly interesting, textured and rich. I think everyone in this cast deserved an award. This film continues to haunt me (in the very best way). I watch this film several times a year, and never cease to be amazed by all of the performances. This film should be placed in a time capsule as an example of excellence in film for the end of the last century. Have I gushed enough for everyone?	10
 I hope.		10
 favorite movie		10
 good film	i think this film is a superb film because it's really heart warming and tearful. Also the film is good because it tells you what prisons were like in 1947 the scene i like the most is the end because the way he broke out of prison with the hammer and stone and when he escaped through a tunnel of filth. it was good because he kept it secret by covering the hole with the poster.When the warden walks in and looks at the bible and the hammer shape is in the book at it says salvation will set you free. The scene where brooks hung him self because he didn't like the outside world. It was also sad when tommy got shot because he knew who killed the bankers wife and lover.	10
 Hope is everything!	Excellent movie! I've seen it for several times but I can't stop watching it. It's memorable! The actors play is magnificent! Hope is what we need most! Redemption is just a word like every other word. In a corrupt system, hope never dies. Andy is not only just a smart guy. He takes advantage of the whole corrupt system. There were and there will always exist innocent people in jail. How you can prove your innocence is a matter of common sense which is not evenly distributed. Hope is always needed as long as corruption never end. When hope dies, everything else dies slowly. And in the end a question: what would one like Andy do not in 1966, but in 2006. Could he still get into prison, could he still escape, could he still take financial advantage over the system? I hope he could!	10
 An excellent movie, glorious acting.	The Shawskank Redemption is a movie of immense talent, looking into the deepest feelings of prison, and surviving it. It all starts when Andy Dufresne, a successful banker and a geologist hopeful, (Tim Collins) is wrongly accused of his wife's and her lover's murder, sent to prison, and makes new relationships and learns to deal with prison, along the way meeting someone in particular, Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). Ends hopefully, not with that much of a cliffhanger but still much room for good to happen, not too much for bad, and definitely one of my all-time favorite movies. A good look at the troubles, realities, and heartbreaks of prison. Good quotes on hope.	10
 woooooo	I voted a 10 (excellent). WOOOOOOO!!!!!!! It was intense, sad, dramatic, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. I love history, so this story brought what i knew to life. It led me to question many things about life's trials and tribulations and the strength it takes to overcome any struggle. Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and his narration of the film is truly special. His role of Red is one that demonstrates true character adaptation to real life scenarios and experiences. It is one that will be remembered for a lifetime. Tim Robbins takes the reality of prison life and demonstrates a new side to life in there, one that is different from many others. His heart and soul change over the course of the film, and it it truly exciting to see this adaptation. I LOVED it, and so should you.	10
 Simply the most wonderful, moving film ever made	A simple, but fantastic story.This adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the few exceptions to the rule that the book is always better than the film. The book, whilst brilliant, does not really reveal the warmth between the two leads, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.It is simply a wonderful story, with fantastic, understated performances by the two leads in particular, but also by the whole supporting cast.The Shawshank Redemption is beautifully filmed and directed, this is the perfect movie all round. It is criminal that it did not win the best film Oscar.	10
 Powerful interaction between soundtrack and dialog	"A big part of this film's appeal is the interplay between Thomas Newman's soundtrack and the simple yet profound dialog. The CD score stands up as a great work on its own. It alternates between brooding piano and powerful orchestration, with a few oldies added for context.Three scenes, named by corresponding tracks, are especially poignant. The first is ""Brooks Was Here,"" followed by ""Zihuatanejo"" and ""So Was Red"" (that title carries over from the Brooks track). To me, the third is among the most moving sequences in film history. You can't top Morgan Freeman saying ""Get busy livin'..."" as the inspiring music plays in the background."	9
 this is life itself	"I was forced to give this movie a rating of 10. Because this movie is a lesson on how life itself is, it deserves much more.The last comment poster asked who the reader's ""Andy"" was. I ask that poster who his ""Red"" is :). A little cheeky, but an important question, because Andy always needs Red to survive and make meaning of what is around them, of what is their life. Andy is a viewer in some respects, picking up and learning and teaching in a nonchalant manner.I also believe, perhaps, Andy and Red often exist in the one and same person."	10
 A masterpiece		10
 A film worthwhile watching!	"Shawshank Redemption along with Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Star Wars, Goodfellas, and the Godfather are worth every amount you spend. Even though this movie isn't at all like the Stephen King novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", this movie has done some amazing changes with comparisons to the novel and ultimately, I thought the film was better than the novel itself. I was blown away by the storyline, especially when Morgan Freeman was narrating. However, it was a disappointment that the film never won any of seven academy award nominations. If you are looking for a film to watch: one that has an amazing script you hardly see in today's films, one that has some great actors, and one that shows a strong bonding of friendship... this is the one to see! I give this film a 10 out of 10 because it was worthwhile watching and was worth every penny I spent on the 10th anniversary DVD."	10
 Reflects the human condition	It's my personal favorite. A man discovers himself after he is sentenced to life in prison, and can escape and move to Zihuatanejo, his greatest dream. It's something that represents the human condition of looking for what you want, but quiet few can achieve their goals as Andy Dufresne did with patience and courage.The rhythm of the movie is slow and subtle, as a fairy tale but with the harshness of reality.You can watch it over and over again and keep enjoying the ride...it's a classic and classics prevail!	10
 The best movie to date.	No other movie has portrayed the resolve of the human spirit as well, or as classy as The Shawshank Redemption. Emotional and brutal, this movie shows us what hope can really do for a man. It has men connecting in a strong straight way. What better place then a prison to forge the friendships that will last a lifetime. Steven King, for a horror writer, writes some of the human dramas out there. I can't believe this is not the number one movie. The Godfather was good yes, but it falls short of this film. If you haven't seen this movie, what the hell is wrong with you? Go buy it you will not be sorry, and if you are, there is something wrong with you.	10
 perfect	a perfect movie, no flaws. anyone who appreciates film will enjoy this movie. Twists, excitement, and wisdom are all displayed in this movie and it is the best movie i have ever seen. it is impossible to seriously give this movie a 1. it deserves at least a 9. A movie like this deserves to be number one of all time. freeman is outstanding while Robbins has a breakout roll. no flaws in acting, no flaws in story line. king has done it again! a marvel movie that will keep you glued to your seat for the entire time. 2 hours of pure excitement. i can not even begin to imagine a movie that is better then this, INCREDIBLE!!	10
 All-time greatest under-rated film		10
 They don't get much better than this		9
 Time flies ....	"Time flies when having fun is the least you can say about this movie. One of the few movies that let's me forget all about time and reminds me that you don't need CGI and a quazillion of dollars to make a great movie!!! I got a similar feeling when watching ""The Green Mile"". It probably has something to do with the balance of the movie (I'm no expert but it has to be something like that). It has the perfect balance between all kinds of feelings/emotions without trying to pull you to one side of the ""emotionscale"". Don't think that this gives you a dull movie!Just get it, sit back and enjoy!!!"	10
 Best of the Best	This is one of those movies that you have to watch when you find it on TV even though you've watched it 10 times. Great acting. Great storyline. GREAT MOVIE. This movie is almost perfect. I seen it a dozen of times and it keeps getting better. Best movie ever. Why? Because the satisfaction you get in the end! You know how he did it and you can almost feel how he must have felt! This movie is pure glory. This movie is the best description of the word hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great actors and they have some kind of chemistry. And the one thing this movie is so great is that you don't want it to end. You know it is going to end but you want it to go on and on and on. But unfortunately, every beginning has also an end. That is from another movie which we all know and was by the way very disappointing	10
 The Perfect Movie	Shawshank Redemption is the most perfect movie I've ever seen, right from flawless acting and razor-sharp screenplay to an amazing background score. A lot of thought has gone into every scene and every scene flows smoothly into the next with no abrupt transitions. Though Andy Dufresne is the central character of the movie, the characters of Brookes and Red are also vital to the theme of the Shawshank Redemption. Scenes of brutal violence in the prison have the intended effect on the audience without being too gory.One of the few movies that have driven home the power of hope so effectively, this is one movie that will lift your spirits in times of gloom.	10
 I hope...		10
 Shawshank Redemption	Aftet watching this movie once, it was in my Top 20, after watching it twice it was in My Top 10, and after watching it multiple times, it's going to take a hell of a good movie took knock it off my #1 movie of all time.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbin's in easily both of their greatest performances of all time, make this one movie that will hands down go as the best movie of all time without an Oscar. The first hour or so is moving beyond a shadow of a doubt, but the last two will draw you to tears and inspire you beyond words.Watch it, watch it and watch it again!!!	10
 Quite Possibly the Best Movie Ever Made	"It's hard to imagine that maybe the most uplifting film of all time is set inside the walls of a prison but that is the case in The Shawshank Redemption. The film is about friendship, loyalty, and patience which may not seem like the most intriguing elements until you have seen them brought together in this film. Opening with the incarceration of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) for two life terms for the brutal killing of his wife and her lover the film seems to be heading into dark territory. Instead what we get is an examination of the triumph of human spirit. Shawshank Prison is the meanest prison around, or so says Ellis""Red""Redding(Morgan Freeman) in an early narration. This is where Red and Andy first meet and where the development of one of the most rewarding screen friendships begins. Tim Robbins who plays Andy gives his best performance. He carries himself in a manner unimaginable considering his predicament. His patience and strength are a marvel. Morgan Freeman turns in the performance of his career as Red who narrates the film as well as provide the realism that Andy has suppressed back. Andy is a patient man who walks the yard of Shawshank like he doesn't have a care in the world. The film's success lies in the relationship between Andy and Red. Their friendship carries them through the struggles of the prison term and us through the film. One of the most memorable endings in film history comes from their life long bond. I am being vague on details because I do not want to spoil the film for anyone who has not seen it. As far as I am concerned it is something that you should do immediately. The Shawshank Redemption does so much well. But above all it is a story of hope. The ability to persevere through any situation is the hallmark of this remarkable film."	10
 a real true great......	The best films are those which you just watch not knowing anything about it...not hearing any publicity...no mad movie premier parties just a tape in the video player, watching it with my granddad. I had just left school and film was a passion of mine. I loved watching and making them. I always loved the way films immersed you in and didn't let you go until the credits. This is the absolute prime example of that. Great story, acting, characters and a twisting slam-dunk of an ending. All my favourite films have that quality, seven, six sense and the game. Its just a shame that over the past few years there hasn't been any films which i can honestly add to that list. So come on Hollywood give us proper gutrenching twists not big grizzly apes!!!!	10
 Andy's Innocents in the movie	"I'm just wondering or if we get told in some way if the letter that Andy had sent to the newspaper from the bank had any information about his innocents in the murders of his wife and her lover. This is because Capatin Hadley was arrested outside the prison and the only way that I could see this happen is if Andy had sent some information in that letter to the paper.I'm also just wondering if Norton had any sort of information about Andy's innocents. I haven't read the book ""Rita Heyworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" which is roughly based on the movie. It would be nice if I could get a reply from someone who has an answer too one of these questions."	10
 a fantastic piece of work!	I remember the first time I watched this movie. I was only 10 and i had turned on the TV to watch and i saw this movie called the Shoshana redemption and i thought what a interesting name. But the movie wouldn't have been excellent without the awesome casting of Tim Robbins(Andy), Morgan Freeman (Red), Bob Gunton (Warden Norton), James Handy (Brooks) and Clancy Brown (Captain Byron Hadley). The movie conveys lots of mixed messages but the most important to me is that even though we can be in dark and scary places there can always be light. Only fault that as the years went by, Morgan Freeman didn't look his age. Other then that it was a good movie with a good message that you keep watching over and over again.	10
 Wow		8
 Inspiring wonderful and Should be seen many times	"I love this movie for many reasons. The acting doesn't get any better. One gets easily pulled into the stories and characters with no hesitation. When a story can effortlessly make you care about the situations and troubles it presents, it deserves praise. This movie may not have a revolutionary plot, but it it still everything a good movie should be. One may think the ending is too ""touchy feely"" but i think it adds to the overall appeal ,remember it's not called the ""Shawshank Damnation"". See it and enjoy and remember, it's OK to to cry over happy things too!Final Analysis: I will watch this movie many more times before I die"	9
 Amazing	Wow!..thats basically what I have to say. The beginning is amazing, all the trauma is amazing...and what an ending...after I saw this movie I was at piece and just wanted to open a nice cold beer. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen. Before I saw this movie I watched the Godfather, which I also found amazing and well before that I had my mind set that Pulp Fiction was amongst the best movies I have seen. Without a doubt it is an excellent movie, but this movie just blew me away. If you haven't seen it, I really recommend that you do. I wont let out anything about the movie, because id hate to spoil such a movie for you guys. But one recommendation I give, is watch and relax while it blows you away. Genius! Well thats all I have to say, peace.	10
 It was something unique		10
 Friendship		9
 Great Movie ... the kind of movie to buy for repeat viewing	"This movie is about hope. Sort of like ""Here comes the sun"" by the Beatles. However, unlike George Harrison's sweet melody this film has a dark grit that makes it palatable and relevant to the life of any struggling person. Andy Dufresne is an innocent man convicted to life in the awful Shawshank prison. He perseveres and, in the end, he is saved though what is meant by saved you will have to see by watching the movie. The Shawshank prison is a powerful metaphor for human struggles and limitations. And, in the end, what can any of us do besides persevering in good works? Andy Dufresne shows that this perseverance has value and ultimately triumphs over despair."	10
 two of the best actors of all time give the performance of their careers	"pair two of the best actors of our time (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) with one of the best writers of ALL time (Steven King) and what do you expect? one of the greatest pieces of film of all time...my only complaint is the length of the film, but for what you get, it is well worth it...one of the most moving, powerful films i've ever seen, Tim Robbins gives the performance of his career, and Morgan freeman is near his best from beginning to end, i never lost interest in ""shawshank redemption"", and there was never a time i didn't care what was happening to any character...although it is very constrained in environment, it gives the viewer the sense of freedom and independence among the inmates, despite their confinement by far one of the most emotional and moving films i've ever seen, i've rarely felt so deep for the characters in a movie"	10
 Makes absolutely no sense, when you think about it		
 A part of my life	I've seen this movie about 7 times now and every time i still get the shivers that i had the first time watching it.This movie is absolute my nr.1 movie by far and is not just a film but also leaves a vision on life and to appreciate a good friendship in the deepest meaning. The quotes given in the film are typical and makes you think of how you should live your life. It made me think about stuff.the movie touched me in such a way that i thought of certain attributes in life suddenly more beautiful.If i ever need to be reminded or have a wake up call, i play the shawshank redemption. I was later on surprised that it was written by Stephen King, a guy that is most known for his work on thrillers/horrors.	10
 Get busy living or get busy dying	This is by far the most underrated movie ever made. The movie itself is just so well done that I don't ever get tired of seeing it. I found out about it 2 years after it came out and since then it's made an impression on me that affects me even to this day. The movie is brilliance and it's done so well that it upsets me to know that it didn't do as well as it should have in the box office. But it's a similar thing that paralleled The Wizard of Oz and Gone with The Wind in 1939 it did it again in 1994 with The Shawshank Redemption and Forrest Gump. This movie though as whole is one of the best films put together that shows morale code, fear and hope. It shows what can be taken from us, from freedom or someone (Tommy getting killed) from any situation that was put together but hope stays with us and cant be beaten or stolen from us unless we let it and this movie shows us that in an honest way that isn't exaggerated. To me I'll never get tired of seeing this movie nor get tired of what it means. Hope.	10
 I thanked my DVD shop owner	Must see, please do not read the reviews on this movie until you have seen it, you would repent your decision if you came to know the story.So much detailed, full of suspense - yet nobody could guess what (the hell) was going on! The poster, small hammer (or whatever), the book keeping - and above all the HOPE - I am so much impressed by this film. It never looked like a movie of such a fantastic end. Well, one could guess that Andy (Tim) might not have murdered his wife, but it was difficult to imagine the depth in story. I am inclined to read the novel now. Would you believe, this movie was recommended by the DVD shop owner, who I thought was interested only in the hit (read well-known) movies.	10
 A movie that changed my life		10
 Outstanding film of any time		10
 I was not disappointed	"I bought this film just due to its high score on IMDb. I was not disappointed. My comment to my wife after seeing this, was ""nothing actually happened, but I could still not take my eyes from the screen"". This movie works like emotional magic to a guy who normally swears to action, horror and FX movies. Hats off to the actors, the script writer and the director.And no hats off to the IMDb people who make me write 10 lines. I don't care if I'm banned from writing more reviews by adding these final meaningless lines. I've used IMDb since it was born, and this is the first time I've actually felt like telling the world a movie is worth watching. It's probably also the last time, so just ban me from commenting further."	10
 An Overshadowed Epic		10
 The best movie I have ever seen	I like this movie for the following reasons. first its screen play is perfect. The hero acted in a correct fashion. He lived the character. Through out the movie he displays a balanced mind. I like the movie because it talks about hope and how hope will bring happiness. I always used to think about it when ever I lose hope in doing some work or in solving my own problems. The two characters Hero and his friend were shown of opposite in nature. Hero always talks about hope and his friend talks opposite to hope. This makes me feel what really life will be without hope and with hope. One more thing It teaches is It does not matter where we are but what we do.	10
 A great feeling	After watching this movie, you come to think about how important and valuable your freedom really is.I think everyone should watch this movie. The story is very well shown and played, the actors were amazing and I didn't see any failure except that eventually, the end goes by really fast, but maybe it's better like this, when the happy things aren't described, your imagination can make the most wonderful story out of it.On the not so good series, I'd point the captain of the guards, who seemed to have some good feelings at some moments of the movie, and who ended killing the young guy in such a pitiful and disappointing way. Also the director of Shawshank died without getting what he should have receive for being such a bastard, which was quite unfair.But well, the worst punishment you could get, is not physical, nor material, it's when you discover you ruined your life, and lost your time.I gave this movie a 9, because nobody and nothing is perfect.I can guarantee that you won't regret watching this, even if it takes away 2 hours of your free time, this movie could make you realize how to spend the remaining ones of your life in the most clever way.GO FREEDOM ! :-)	9
 A great movie	We were supposed to read The Shawshank Redemption book for English class, at first my classmates (also myself) thought that this would be a boring story. We were wrong. The book is incredible, stephen king is a genius, but moreover, the movie was brilliant, never before in my life I've seen such movie with an excellent plot, excellent actors and an excellent direction, this is by far one of the greatest movies of all time (along with a clockwork orange), I'm just a fan of it, here in Chile we don't get to see many books by this author but what the hell, a great book and a excellent movie, should be considered the greatest movie of all time :D	10
 anniversary edition	I had originally owned this film on VHS. It grew on me to where I was watching it nearly once a week. The tape had gotten so bad that I could no longer enjoy the film. i have replaced my VHS tape with the 10th year anniversary two-disc special edition and i have really enjoyed the many extras made available. The commentaries from Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and others contribute so much more that i would recommend to the first time viewer, if there are any, to view these bonus tracks prior to the movie. The extras sell the film all over again. I continue to watch this film a couple of times a month. The film lifts my spirits and jump starts my soul. Thank you Frank Darabont. oh, and Stephen King for a great experience with this film which has become one of my all time favorites...	10
 Exploring your own soul		9
 Watch this movie. Then watch it again	"The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. Ranked 2 in the top 250 films it is clear others agree with me. And when you watch this you will too. The plot may sound familiar (guy goes to jail, guy escapes jail) but this is nothing like i have seen before. It's about Andy Dufresnes (Tim Robbins) determination and persistence which keeps him going through his 19 years. But the film is also about Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman) commonly known as ""Red"". He does not claim innocence and is the only guilty man in Shawkshank. When Dufresne arrives Red makes a bet he'd be first to crack. But Andy stays strong which surprises Red. He uses this strength to keep going day after day and he passes this feeling onto Red when he tells him of a box planted under the tree. This gives Red some hope, It gives him something to look forward to and that will keep him going day by day. Without Andy Red would have nothing in life. And when you have nothing in life like Brooks did... There is nothing to keep you going onto the next day. This film is brilliantly scripted. The acting is top class and you get the feel of the innocent man amongst the guilty. The corrupt guards and wardens add to Andys story of wrong convictions and unfairly treated. He just happens to be the only innocent man in Shawshank."	10
 A perfect performed perfect story...	The performance by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins in this movie is so incredible realistic that you are really ought to believe this story is true, as said in the end. Not just a 'one-to-watch', the best movie ever, which, in my honest opinion, beats the godfather with ease! I cannot tell anything about the movie, because I'll mess up the story for the ones that haven't seen the movie yet, but believe me, the twist in the end of the movie, it's just fascinating... The whole person of Dufresne is fascinating, the calmth in his whole appearance, the way he's living his life in jail, in one word fascinating. The same thing goes for Morgan Freeman though, it is just incredible, wonderful, fascinating... Just... Just watch it. You'll love it.	10
 Hope, thy name is Shawshank Redemption	"If there is one word which entails the entire message of this film, it is HOPE. Though I have never been a Stephen King fan, this is one story which makes him deserve accolades over and over again. When I was watching the movie, halfway through it, I admit I was bored. And when Tommy (Gil Bellows) was shot, I was like ""Who the hell recommended me this movie??"". But still I just wanted to get this movie over with, so I watched further. And when that scene comes where the warden throws a pebble at the poster and it tears right through!!! My God!!! My mouth was agape the whole time!!! What a fantastic ending!. The movie indeed has the best finale in cinematic history.(The Usual Suspects comes a close second..). Performances were superb.. (..I still think Tim Robbins deserved a nomination more than Morgan Freeman..). The wardens were damn good as the tormentors. But overall, I believe the story itself deserves a special place in the annals of great cinema!!!"	10
 A Narrative Masterpiece....	"Brilliance. Total Brilliance. From the perfectly casted roles, to the haunting music; the all-encompassing narrative provided by Morgan Freeman, to the magnificent storyline and plot, this movie blends all these elements of good film-making. So much so, that even something as commonly overlooked as having just enough comedy to provide relief from total somberness, but not enough to distract from the misery of prison life brought by the equally criminal actions of those in authority at the prison; this, too, was executed with perfection. This movie is the blueprint for what I would consider to be the perfect movie. I challenge anyone to come up with something they would ""do better"" than what those who made this movie did."	10
 A spectacular movie...		10
 Great but still a little over rated	I'd be lying to you if I told you that when Andy brakes out of his cell and crawls to freedom, I wasn't just as happy as the masses of people that call this their all time favorite move. And to say that I wasn't riveted when he is locked i the office and turns up the music while being threatened by the guards would also be untrue. But at the same time, this movie is most certainly not the second best film ever because of one simple reason: It can't decide if it wants to be real with occasional hints of hope or imaginative and dreamy. It drags you along for two hours of hard depressing facts and victory only in the most modest portions, then, for whatever reason, has a Hollywood ending of him digging through the wall then picking up the bank account that there's no way in hell that he'd be able to get in real life. This is great entertainment and I give it a ton of credit for having the ability to maintain my attention the whole time. But at the same time, the ending proved a little disappointing because it betrayed everything that this movie was trying to be.	8
 Get a hope and keep it.		
 who is responsible for the death of the old man		
 who redeems to whom?		
 A well thought-out film	"This film is one of those you would like to keep and watch over and over. Not a typical jailbird flick. Rather a story about struggle and overcoming and greatness. A happy end in this one feels true and believable although it wasn't necessary.Another interesting thing is that none of the characters in it is made to be hated. No classical ""bad guys"". Everybody here serves a certain purpose to the story, thus directing the fate of protagonists.I couldn't believe it was Steven King who wrote this. I generally don't like his stories, but that should obviously go for his sci-fi novels only. They all start well but finish ridiculously. However, it turns out that the man also penned ""the Green Mile"", another story that became a film that left a true impression. Gotta stop berating Steven King."	9
 Gets better with age	"*Possible SpoilerI was fifteen years old at the time this film was released, and it instantly became one of my favorite films after the first time I watched it. Part of the film was shot 10 minutes from where I grew up at the Wyandot County Court House in Upper Sandusky, Ohio. A classmate of mine's father was a juror in the opening scenes of the film. The rest of the film was shot about 45 minutes from my home in Mansfield, Ohio at the historic Mansfield Reformatory. Every year, the famous prison has haunted tours and sleepovers during the Halloween season, and is open for historic tours during other parts of the year. There are many websites devoted to this site. Being a fairly rural area of the state, it is quite an honor to have lived near the filming of one of the best films of all time. As I have grown into an adult, I have grown to appreciate the artistic value of the film even more. Morgan Freeman delivers his best performance (all of his are great though). ""Red"" is the epitome of a man who just wants to be part of life. Although confined inside walls, he can function normally by doing things to make others happy, in turn making himself happy. He is much like any working man that lives on the outside. Andy (Tim Robbins) just amazes you with his selflessness. He sacrificed his own well-being for others many times during his stay at the Shawshank. It took him a longtime, but his desire to live eventually freed him. The film left me surprised many times. But once you have got to know Andy, nothing he does will surprise you. He's the guy you knew back in the day that had all the luck. (We've all known guys or girls like that). This film is 10 out of 10. It has moments of suspense, mystery, action, surprise, drama, sadness, and even a little comedy if you know where to look for it."	10
 a true modern classic		10
 Best movie ever. Why? Because the satisfaction you get in the end!	This movie is almost perfect. I seen it a dozen of times and it keeps getting better. Best movie ever. Why? Because the satisfaction you get in the end! You know how he did it and you can almost feel how he must have felt! This movie is pure glory. This movie is the best description of the word hope. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both great actors and they have some kind of chemistry. And the one thing this movie is so great is that you don't want it to end. You know it is going to end but you want it to go on and on and on. But unfortunately, every beginning has also an end. That is from another movie which we all know and was by the way very disappointing.	10
 Sometimes movies grab you and let go after you are done watching it. This one keeps on holding.		10
 how can we compare ??	Sci-Fi, Heroic fantasy are good stories and can make good films? But how can we compare movies that make you enjoy cinema and a movie that adds dimensions such as thinking a long time after the show, and that makes you behave differently?Human relationships, hope, will, friendship are eternal themes... If you want to watch a movie that will move you, watch this movie. If you want to entertain, go and watch LOTR, Star Wars.Classify movies depending on your personnality, your moods, your own tastes, is good. To my mind this film is really great and i'm not surprised at all if it is nowadays ranked in 2nd place.	10
 hope is a good thing maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies	The great words spoken by Andy to Red. Never give up. Shawshank is a movie based on a book by Stephen King. When I tell people this it is hard for them to believe. This is the best adaptation of a King story that he has not written the screenplay for. Even though some of the characters in the movie don't fit the descriptions from the story they work.The movie shows the life of a prisoner convicted of a crime that he says he did not commit and the great friendship he develops with Red and the daily problems a prisoner faces. This is a great story and I never get tired of watching it. I have seen it 30 times and it gets better every time.Get busy living or get busy dying.	10

 I have to say		10
 A great movie made of a good novel by Stephen King.	This is one of the best drama movies I've ever seen. It seems that Stephen King's jail novels are always a success movies, as The Green mile was even better than this. Homewer, these two movies are so different they really can't be compared.Tim Robbins plays one of his best (if not the best of all) roles and I could not imagine anyone else to this role. The story is stunning and this time, the movie is actually better than the book.When you start to watch this film, you can't stop, until the film ends. That describes how interesting and addictive this movie is. I recommend this to anyone, except to the most eager action fans.	10
 Jailhouse Rock	I made my Stephen King debut with this particular story when I was in my late teens. Frank Darabont shot a wonderful adaptation which is not very common. Great actor Tim Robbins played the unfortunate Dufresne with such a grace that you never think that the guy was very small in size in the original story. Morgan Freeman is in his prime playing Red, the most useful person in the jail. The suicide of the old prisoner and the last scene where both friends meet are the most emotional ones. And of course we should salute the most beautiful supporting actress ever, Rita Hayworth. Darabont never tries to steal parts from the original story. May be this is why the film is always remembered as a good piece of art.	10
" The ""Greatest Film"" Game"	"Rather than just enjoy movies, critics like to play ""The Greatest Film"" game.  A few years back, it was rare that a contemporary film was picked as greatest.  ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Le Grand Illusion,"" ""The Gold Rush"" and other pre-1950 films usually got the nod well into the 1980's.Then, for some reason, most likely the Internet opening up a voice for the average person to rate film, contemporary films started getting in. ""Schindler's List"" was one that comes to mind.  ""Shawshank Redemption"" is another.While picking the same old, stale films year after year doesn't seem to be logical, picking newer ones has a certain risk.  Many films amaze and beguile audiences when they come out because they are geared to what currently sells.  As years passed, the flaws become apparent and they drop out of sight, while timeless films initially received lukewarmly, or even critically, such as ""The Wizard of Oz,"" ""The General,"" or ""Intolerance"" soar.  Will ""The Shawshank Redemption"" drop into obscurity, too?  I don't think so. Why?  One can try to explain.Two possible reasons are Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I don't know if either are underrated actors or not, but I rarely hear people remark how completely they transform themselves from role to role.  This is certainly the case here. The two performances, and the chemistry between the two men is the core of the film and reinforces one of its primary messages: never let anyone make you lose hope.  The fact the setting, prison, is alien to most filmgoer's experience, doesn't matter.  ""Shawshank"" could never be considered a ""prison"" film.  It contains a story as archetypal as ""The Odyssey,"" a long journey, through many dangers, that ends with the traveler (this time, two travelers) seen to a safe shore (literally!).Another great strength of ""Shawshank"" is how it operates on different levels.  Like Jon Avnet's ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" it has its most obvious message--about not losing hope and surviving--set highest.  But as ""Tomatoes"" had a gay subtext that could be acknowledged or ignored, so does ""Shawshank,"" that prison is a dehumanizing experience that ends up ruining people for life rather than just letting them pay their debts to society and move on.Given this country's conservative bent, it is somewhat bizarre that a film that carries this message is so adored.  All I can say is the other aspects of the film allow one to ignore it and still enjoy it, which is probably fitting since films where the message is the most important thing, such as those of the '50's and '60's, now show their age badly. In the final analysis, though, regardless of what elements we pick at, we ultimately can't say why ""Shawshank"" is so great.  We just know it is by how we feel and how others feel.Two final examples of the latter.    The moment in Andy's escape when he stands in the sewage lagoon outside the prison and holds his arms up in jubilation as the rain pours on him is always a part of trailers and coming attractions.  Indeed it was part one of the film's original ads.  Why should the filmmakers give away the ending?  Because there is nothing to give away.  One can see the film 100 times knowing Andy will escape and still want to see it, because it isn't about an escape plot.  It's about Andy and Red's journey and what they teach each other.The second example is that the Lifetime Channel, which generally shows either classic ""Chick Flicks"" like ""Thelma and Louise,"" or made for TV things about unfaithful or homicidal husbands, showed this as their feature presentation one evening and this is a film that really has no women in it at all.Of course, one can argue a ""Chick Flick"" is really just a film that values exploration of deep human feelings and relationships more than car chases and explosions.  If that is the case, then ""Shawshank"" is the greatest Chick Flick of them all.And I think the Greatest Film Game never fit more than here."	
 One of the best acted films I have seen		10
 Very interesting	"I think this movie is clearly a 10. To call it the second best movie of all time might be a bit over the top. However, it is impressive that it has got almost 120.000 votes. Anyway, I thought it was really interesting. Tim Robbins is a very good actor and so is Morgan Freeman. Anyway, there is one thing that annoys me, and that is the focus on what one might call ""transgression"". I mean the warden and sadistic prison guards - all this is a bit too far out I think and works to the movies disadvantage. The love of transgression is always followed by some kind of sentimental prejudice. However, that does not damage the movie as a whole. It's really an amazing story which keeps you guessing till the end."	8
 It all comes together...		10
 What a joy	This masterpiece has taught me the meaning of the word hope. The ending was far better than winning the lottery or even accomplishing your dreams.Superb acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, a job beautifully executed.When my little girl is old enough to understand the concepts of life, hope and dreams I will be sure to watch this movie beside her, God permit.If you have not seen this movie, I highly recommend you do so. I will do my best to remember the words of wisdom and caring actions demonstrated by the character Andy. If we all did, we would all live in a better world.10/10	10
 Like Bernard Matthews Turkey Drummers--Bootiful!		10
 first time is the charm	"I never intended to ever watch this movie. A girlfriend of mine told me ""you'll love it."" And after I finished watching it I was stunned. No movie other than ""The Accidental Tourist"" has had such an influence on my life. This movie is about hope and it shows you that it can never be lost. It also shows you that the weakest looking people may actually be the strongest. The thing about Shawshank Redemption is even if you hate dramas you'll appreciate this movie nevertheless. This movie stopped me from being an action genre junkie and turned me into a connoisseur of great movies. Even though there is no science-fiction in this movie you'll still feel that its magical. However, the first time you view it will be the best. Go see it.......it'll make your day brighter!"	10
 Hope	"This movie is the greatest source of inspiration within my life. I mean the line that says, ""Hope is a good thing; maybe even the best of things and no good thing ever dies."" That line just brings hope (haha) to my daily life. The acting in this movie is sensational. Ever since I saw this movie I have reached a whole new level of appreciation and respect for Tim Robbins. Morgan Freeman is awe inspiring. Some people don't appreciate this type of movie and disrespect the meaning of the film. It is seen to others as a modern portrayal of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. This movie is spectacular and any one who doesn't like it or hasn't seen it is insane."	10
 best ending? (spoiler)	"The ending of this movie might be the most rewarding ending I've ever seen, from a movie-goers point of view. Not only is Andy an innocent man, it seems he suffers more than all the guilty men around him. After he climbs out of the sewer and tastes freedom after decades of unjust imprisonment, his passion for his newly found freedom is almost palpable from the theatre seat or my home sofa (wherever I'm watching it). I challenge you to find a movie with a better ending. Questions: Is Andy raped by the ""sisters"" or no? I thought Morgan Freeman's voice-over was kind of unclear on this point. Number two. What are the odds that the tin box that contains the money and note wouldn't be all rusted out?"	10
 Fresh Fish	"The first time I saw this movie, I went in with a negative attitude. It looked drab and boring. No explosions, no special effects, no stunts, no females... no chance it would be good, right. Wrong! The on-screen duo of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman should be the envy of any actors that ever have to share a set with other actors. The supporting cast was remarkable, and the storyline is second to none. I'm glad I sucked it up that first time, because without that first time watching ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I would have never been able to watch it the twenty times that I have. Will go down as one of the best movies in the history of cinema, and will get no argument from me!"	10
 A film I keep returning to	Despite all of it's flaws, it is a good film. A film I can watch over and over. It sticks, it holds, it is like great mascara and hairspray rolled into one big great mess. Andy is like me. Red is like me. Brooks....I like a lot about it. It's spellbounding. A picture worth a thousand words breathtaking. Living inside it, not imagining anything else. It is a wonderful amazing piece of rubbish.I'd like to thank Darabont, the screenwriter and the director, for finding a heart in a story to give to the masses. We love you too.Give it up for Mr. Andy Dufresne!	10
 2nd Best Movie Ever	"Best Scene : Red's last parole speech  ""rehabilitated? it's just a made up word, a politicians word so young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and tie and have a job""Another great comment is when Red says of Andy that he ""had a walk and a talk about him that wasn't normal"" like ""a man out for a stroll in the park""I can understand why this movie is listed at #2 of 250 on the IMDB user rating.Is there any doubt that Freeman is one of the best actors in history.oh yeah, personal best movie ever... BETTER OFF DEAD"	
 Excellent acting, great suspense; pity about worn-down motifs	This is a very thrilling movie that kept me spellbound. The acting is first rate. Morgan Freeman is superb and so is Tim Robbins. The reason why in my opinion it only deserves 8 out of 10 rather than 9 is that the story is not that great. Anyone who has seen his or her share of prison films will have come across all the standard ingredients: brutality by the staff, abuse by fellow prisoners, corruption at the top, we have seen it all before (cf. for example Brubaker). Despite these reservations, the acting, music and direction makes up for it. An evening well spent!	8
 Shawshank: The Redeeming Feature	If your like me and have bought the limited edition DVD then you should of seen it.  I thought it was pretty good but gave the same insight to the film that I've always had.  I mean it was interesting because I love the film so much but I wanted more of an opinion from producers and directors. Anyway what do you think?	10
 Great Soundtrack	Amazing that a movie with this much misery can be about hope. Great performances throughout. Thomas Newman does a fantastic job with the soundtrack here as he does on American Beauty and Road to Perdition. Also he took cousin Randy's role in Finding Nemo.	10
 Great movie?...Yes. 2nd best movie ever?...No.	1 VERY MINOR SPOILER INCLUDED.I will openly admit that the whole reason I watched this movie is because it is ranked number 2 on the IMDb top 250. I will further admit that, yes, the movie is great. But #2 of all time? Mmmmm... no. There aren't particularly any flaws with the film, aside from the fact that it spans a 20 year period and nobody seems to age at all. The performances are stellar and it desrves to be lauded as a great film. If you haven't seen it, see it, you will be glad you did. I was.	8
 Strength of the mind/knowledge/intelligence	I've seen the film almost a dozen times. I am fascinated. The most important thing in the film is the intelligence which allows Andy to survive, to build his own world, to separate him from the surroundings. Unfortunately, J feel it is impossible in the real world.	10
 Most dramas wish they could be this	The Shawshank Redemption is right up there with my favourite movies. Its probably the best deep story example of a movie that I like.The film is a touching tale of the dehumanizing effects of a life in prison, a modern version of which can be seen on HBO's Oz. I digress, the first time I saw this movie, I was actually touched by the story.I began to feel crappy for Andy, I understood Red's bitterness, disgusted when Andy crawled out the crap pipe. The movie tells a very very powerfully depressing story, but to keep the watcher from getting mad has an amazingly uplifting ending, that makes the story seem worth it.Amazing, enough said.	10
 Accused of the wrong crime	This is one of King's best movies. It's about a guy who is accused of killing his wife and is sent to prison. He meets a man named Red in prison who he sort of inspires to do more with his life. Near the end something happens that you would never expect and is very interesting. This is a great movie and the director did a great job in showing Stephen King's book and not wrecking it.	9
 ONE OF THE BEST EVER	IF for any reason your feeling unhappy and despair, this is the movie that will surly change and improve your mood.THE movie is truly remarkable, from total despair, sadness and no hope, which appears from every element in the movie, characters, sound, walls, closed doors, injustices ...AT the end (possible spoiler) came light, warmth, love, hope, peace and mostly the unmatchable feeling  freedom and of the free spiritWHAT an outstanding movie.	
 A Hymn to the Determination and Belief of Man	A hymn to the determination and belief of man, 'Shawshank Redemption' truly deserves its place as the second best film made in the IMDB poll.How on Earth we all missed this one when it was at the cinema is truly baffling; but it has now gained the worldwide recognition it so richly deserves.Robbins is absolutely superb as Andy Dufresne and actually surpasses Freeman's performance (about the only actor to do this) as 'Red'. It's pointless describing the story, suffice to say that it stands head and shoulders above all other movies as a testament to the endurance and power of the human spirit, that almost no matter what situation we find ourselves in, we can endure and prevail. Incredible, thought-provoking and a cornerstone of modern day storytelling.	
 Brilliant movie	Why talk so much about this movie when the movie already speaks for itself as one of the best film of all time. The movie is too good to be explain by me; you have to see it for yourself.Exceptional.Max- 9.5/10	10
 An excellent movie	This ranks as one of my all time favourite movies. There is so much to love about this movie, the characters, Morgan Freeman's narration and the story. The movie runs for quite a while, but it hardly seems so. A definite must own movie.	10
 A must see...	"Hey there, I must tell you I just saw the movie and it's been out like eight years or so ...Great movie even now in the 21st century. I'm sure it'll still be great many years from now, such as ""Gone with the wind""- another classic. I'll sure be seeing it again and then some. I'm not gonna spoil it because I'm sure by now you've seen it or if not someone has already given you or you've read the synopsis. However, just trust me in my words, "" Don't rent the movie, BUY IT! It's that Good!!!!"" Well, take care and look no further this is the last advice you need  :-) go see it, your ""hopes"" will come true!..."	
 Should be number one!!!!!!!!	The best movie ever made. Perfect acting, direction, script, music etc. It was seriously robbed at the Oscars in the worse Academy Award mistake of recent years.There is no film better. That's all there is to say.	10
 If I could only watch one movie for the rest of eternity, this would be the one!	Just watch the movie.  I don't care what kind of movies you might typically be a fan of because this one carries true meaning.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at their best.  If you are ever feeling down, then pop this in the player because it helps.  I just love this movie.  I only hope I can look forward to a movie in the future that will touch me the way this one has!See it!  I promise you won't regret it.	10
 Excellent from all aspects, script, performances, and photography	This film has the best of what films are supposed to be. This not your everyday prison movie. This a story of friendship and hope. The story and the resulting script are riveting. You are gathered into the story and become engrossed with the progress of the action and the character development.   The performances are superior at both the star and supporting levels. Morgan Freeman is superb as is James Whitmore. The filming is so good that you forget you are watching a movie and practically believe you are viewing the real thing. One of the top ten.	9
 True friendship	People say that Shawshank is a fairy tale, or that it doesn't represent real prison life.  I say, fine, ok, you're right -- but that doesn't stop me from finding it one of the most beautiful films I have seen. I've watched lots of movies, old and new.  None have left me feeling as breathless and vaguely intoxicated as Shawshank.  Not a one.  Casablanca, Citizen Kane, Rashamon, etc... great movies all, without doubt.  But Shawshank still sits on top of my canon. Call me shallow.  Call me unsophisticated and easily manipulated by saccharine cinematic swill.  Whatever.  That's the last thing on my mind when I watch the camera pull back as Red and Andy embrace on that beach in Mexico.  I'm thinking about the power and redemptive value of a true friendship.  And Shawshank is, in this reviewer's opinion, the single most evocative and powerful portrayal of that sort of friendship ever committed to celluloid. I dare you to watch it without a tear in your eye.	
 Possibly the best film ever!	This film is a film which is moving, dramatic and emotional. It has characters being introduced all throughout the film and makes the film never ending, like Andy's sentence. Freeman and Robbins are both talented actors and bring to the film their own qualities, you never get tired of seeing them. I first saw 'The Green Mile' before i saw this and thought that Frank Darabont made the most moving film ever, but i was wrong. 'The Shawshank Redemption' has scenes of laughter, sad and shear disgust, this is what makes it so powerful. This film is number one in my DVD collection and never get tired of watching it. I honestly recommend it to anyone who likes a late night movie full of emotion.	10
 Shawshank	In every way shape and form, through and through, the greatest movie ever. This doesn't mean my favorite.  This means the art direction the music the story the acting the lighting the ect ect ect were flawless.  Total package of perfection.	10
 A True Classic	Too bad about Tim Robbins' politics, because this is one of the best movies ever made. I never get tired of it. Plot is tightly woven and everything fits together. I particularly enjoy Morgan Freeman, but there are no weak players. This movie deserves to be at the top of the list.	10
 Not as Good with repeated viewings..		9
 Morgan Freeman's performance is truly great!	This film is definitely in my top 10 of all time list.  It is a powerful story and probably the best movie about friendship ever made.  But hands down the one element that makes it a great movie is Morgan Freeman's performance.  I've seen this movie a dozen times or more, and his narration never fails to hook me.	10
 One of the best Stephen King adaptations ever!	"I absolutely loved the origional novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King on which the movie is based, and the movie perfectly reproduced the emotional response i had from the novella. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were definitely the best choices to play the two leads. I thought that Robbins in particular deserved an academy award for his portrayal of Andy Dufresne. If you havn't seen this movie yet, rent it right now! You will not be disapointed."	9
 Great!	This show was great. In my opinion it is the best show that Tim Robbins is in, Morgan Freeman's best show as well (besides Se7en). But still a great film.10/10	10
 If you like `The Green Mile' you will love this movie.	"This is one of my favorite movies and the very first movie I ever bought on DVD. Because I am a fan of Stephen King, I had to see this movie. The movie is based on a short story from King's book ""Different Seasons"" (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption). The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins) who is found guilty of killing his wife and her lover. He is sent to prison and develops a friendship with several of the inmates. However, the main focus is on Andy's close relationship with Red (Morgan Freeman) who has been in prison most of his adult life. I don't want to give up too much for those who haven't seen it. (I'll leave that up to the other posters). If you like `The Green Mile' (another Darabont movie from a Stephen King book) you will love this movie."	
" A story that proves ""hope is a good thing, but faith is better."""	Not the best movie of the decade, but damn close. Shawshank made Tim Robbins a star, and rightfully so. His cool, steady depiction of a condemned man is magnificent. His character Andy's refusal to voluntarily be changed by not only the betrayal of his wife, being wrongly accused of her murder, but also the harrowing experiences of prison life is palpable to say the least. It doesn't hurt to have one of the 5 best actors of our era, Morgan Freeman, as your supporting man. The friendship between the two makes this story not only believable, but also thought provoking and inspirational. The Shawshank Redemption is truely one of the all time greats.	
 Terrific drama with great unpredictable ending		
 The bests of 90s films	Shawshank Redemption would be on any's top ten films of 90s. Very emotionally powerful and inspiring, the movie was on par with the much hyped movie Forrest Gump if not better. It was a prison tale that should be lots of despair, misery and violence yet Shawshank manage to portray the sad as well as hope and salavation of the mind in human beings. Andy(Tim Robbins) as a man who was wrongly convicted of life imprisonment and refusal to give up and despair and efforts to find any means to escape was amazing. His final escape act was a lesson for me in perseverance. A def must watch! The novel by Stephan King which Shawshank is based on gave a little more thoughts into the main characters'mind and you must read the short story if you like the movie.	
 Nothing good ever dies...	What an amazing movie.  The performances, even by the bit players, are fantastic, the story is wonderful, the mood is great...this is about as close as you can get to a perfect film.  The fact that Steven King wrote it makes it all the more amazing.Although one might be tempted to think of this as a prison movie, it's not; it's about hope and redemption.  The hope is embodied in Tim Robbins' character (Andy); the redemption in Morgan Freeman, Red (whose redemption comes as a result of Andy's hope).	10
 The perfect film	The Shawshank Redemption is a perfect film in every aspect. It has a beautiful score (Thomas Newman) and amazing cinematography. The acting is brilliant and the movie stands up well to repeat viewings. The only minor negative that I have for the film is that the main characters don't seem to age enough in the 20 or 30 years that they're in prison. But this is just a minor quibble. Don't let it deter you from watching this movie. It is a great story and every household should have this in their collection.	10
 Absolutly brilliant	One of the best movie's I've seen. As for prison-movies, if you've seen this one you dont have to see any other, it surpasses them all. I was quite unfamiliar with the acting of Tim Robbins before i saw this movie, and I must say he did an excellent job. Morgan Freeman is always superb as a supporting actor, and this movie was no exception. I recommend this movie to anyone that's not scared to watch an intelligent movie with good dialogues, it's not for the pure action-fans a la Robocop, it's a serious movie, but never too mellow.	10
 just great	I've seen the shawshank redemption upwards of 10 times and never get tired of it.  Tim robbins delivers his best preformance as well as morgan freeman. The two play prison inmates who become friends and devise a plan to escape. After that alot of sad things happen to them rape, beatings, solitary confinement, etc.  Morgan Freemans character is released while Tim Robbins succesfully escapes after bringing down the corupt warden and head guard. The acting is superb as well as every other aspect in the film.  I highly recomend this film to any avid movie buff like myself.8/10	
 Great movie, Freeman is unworldly good	Shawshank deserves to be named one of the top 10 movies ever created and its a shame it came out the same year as Forrest Gump. Any other year in the 1990's and it would have obtained the Best Picture Oscar. Morgan Freeman gives the greatest performance of his career and considering all the memorable performances he's given, thats really saying something. Robbins is also terrific as Andy Dufrense, the wrongly convicted wife killer. James Whitmore also gives a memorable performance as the lovable Brooks Hatlen. Frank Darabont really outdid himself with this masterpiece. A must see for all ages!My rating : @@@@@ (out of five)	10
 It's a tear-jerker, but it tears of happiness! :)	BIG SPOILER AHEAD! I was supposed to see the Green Mile instead of this movie, but Blockbuster didn't have it in and recommended this movie.  So I gave TSR (The Shawshank Redemption) a go. And I was really glad I did! Some moments of the film had raw violence, some moments were really depressing, some were amusing (It's Dumas not dumb ass!), and some were really powerful and happy and positive.  I personally thought the ending was flawless.  The main character in the story didn't have the good ending thrown at him, he had to go thorugh some sh!t to get it (literally!) Whenever I think of TSR, I always remember how it ended at the beautiful and bright beach with the two old friends hugging.  Everything was so good and happy even though it was the complete opposite in the beginning.  I expected this to be a very dark movie but it just had that atmosphere in the beginning and that was about it.  But I hate the fact that the boss of the prison had that teenage kid killed!!! That sucked!!!  But anyways...See it! I give this a 10/10!	
 The greatest movie to ever be made period.	What can I say about Shawshank Redemption this movie has everything you possibly can in a movie like great writting,great acting,and great directing.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins give thier best performance of thier life in this great movie.Frank Darabont does a great job with the writting and  Directing.I'm surprised this movie didn't win any oscars.Who cares this movie is still the greatest thing to ever hit the theater.This movie is going to be remember forever.This is truly a great movie in every category.A classic to always remember.	10
 Simply amazing	Going into this movie I was not very excited.  It turned out to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is absolutely phoenomenal and extremely moving.  It shows how infallible the human spirit can be with hope guiding it.	10
 possibly the ultimate film ever	Redemption is a powerful tool and the dynamic tim robbins plays his character to absolute perfection. After being convicted for a crime of passion he did not commit, we follow the eyes of andy dufrane and his sometimes brutal encounters in the shawshank prison. Loss, entrapment and the powerful word 'hope' are some of the initial thoughts i have about the film, but the ending where a lanscape of the perfect shade of blue in the form of the ocean attests the beauty of this film- where there is hope and the psychological will to out- manuver the seemingly futile surrounding walls forms the heart of humanity and its existence	10
 One man's lifelong fight for freedom, and one of the finest films of the last decade		10
 One of the greatest movies in film history.	The Shawshank Redemption is probably the most widely loved movie in all of Western culture.  It's fleshed out characters give it the uncanny ability to deeply touch most of the people who watch it.  We relate to Freeman's character who has lost hope in society.  Robbins' is the friend who redeems us and gives hope back.  Gunton, who plays Warden Norton, is one of the most overlooked villains of all time.  He makes the greatest villain because he is the most realistic and relatable.  He isn't a crazy murderer, he is a corrupt religious official.  I believe this movie gets better when you have already seen it and know what happens.  Seeing the wardern get what's coming to him is consistently satisfying.  And of course, the famous beach scene leaves me on a high every time.  11/10	10
 The Best Movie Ever	It is the best movie ever. I can`t stop watching it! You must see it! A Guy is put to jail for murdering his wife and her lover. The movie is more about Andy Dufrane... and his actions in different situations. It has a great end, and like i said... probably the best movie ever in the history of movies...	10
 The best movie i have ever seen....	Best movie i have ever seen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing here... just brilliant! I would recommend it to anyone who loves a real movie, with and excellent story, acting and spirit.	10
 quite simply, one of the most inspiring movies of all time.	You cannot but feel a sense of unbridled joy when Andy stretches his arms out and feels the rain fall on his face the moment he is free. i own the DVD and i watch it at least once a month and i never fail to get chills on my neck on that scene.once again: one of the most inspiring movies of all time.	10
 Just to say		10
 Drama as it was intended	Shawshank Redemption is the type of movie that all prison movies should be. In fact it is the type of drama that every drama should be. To date I can't think of a film that has just as much or even more character development than this film. And what better place to have it in? Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make this movie what it is through the characters. Through Robbins, we can see a character who is determine and will never give up. And through Freeman we see a man who knows the truth about life inside and the bold truth. We see most of that through Freeman's reflection in his role as the narrator.    I love everything about this film. The cast, sets, characters, scores, script, everything. There are only a few movie that are just as good as this; but shouldn't be compared because like some movies in the film industry because it is the key to cinematic brilliance.	10
 The greatest film of all time	I have just watched this film for the third time and it still knocks me for 6 and brings tears to my eyes. It is criminal that this film did not win any awards. That does not matter because in  time if not already it will without doubt go down as the greatest film of all time. Nothing gets anywhere near it.	
" Rusalka's fourteenth film review: A new kind of ""Morality Play"""		
 a phenomenal film	Such a great film.  Great acting, great cinematography, the list goes on and on.  Undoubtedly a great film, not necessarily good enough for #2 of all time, but great.  Don't miss this one.  I give it 10 out of 10.	10
 The best prison movie ever made!	My cousin always recommends good movies to me and when he suggested this movie, I was not surprised that this was another gem.  This is my all time favorite movie!  I can watch it over and over again.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were gypped out of Academy awards for their roles in this movie! This was as entertaining as it was exciting as it was suspenseful.  I actually read the Stephen King novella, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption and was amazed that they could make such a long movie out of such a short story.  However, the movie was great.  I give this movie 11 out of 10!  That's how much I enjoyed it!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!  I don't want to give away any of the story to those who have not seen it, so I will end my review here!  SEE THIS MOVIE!	
 a must-see movie!	I have seen this movie twice and even the second time it was still a very special movie although you know what is going to happen...Big compliment for writer Stephen King! (I am wondering if it really happend, although it is too good to be true). Wonderfull acting, great story...with emotional moments but not overdone in any way. My favorite scene is when Andy receives the old books and records (big black CD's from the old days:-) and plays a part from a opera through the prison intercom! If you do have the chance: watch it!	10
 Who are the 2400+ cinematic idiots that gave this a 1?	"Sure, everyone is entitled to his opinion, but in the case of The Shawshank Redemption, the statement ""This movie is not a 1 on a 1 to 10 scale"" is not an opinion, it's a fact.  There are no sensible arguments that can be made for this being a 1."	10

 Possibly missing the point?		10
 Modern Day Masterpiece	Everything about shawshank is memorable. Both Tim Robbins And Morgan Freeman deliver wonderful performances, the dark mood settings in the prison and Andy(Tim Robbins)response to these drab settings, the superb cinematography, the masterful plot with its unique twist, the soundtrack,the simple idea of hping to be free. What more can i say, its truly a modern day masterpiece.	
 Universal truth about Shawshank Redemption		10
 one of the best ever!!!	this is a one of the best ever made movies.when i first saw the picture i was very impressed.the end is just great.personally i hate hollywood stupid happy endings but this one... it's just so good u did a good job all of u who vote for this movie tudor	10
 Wonderful and moving	This is truly one of the best films I have ever seen. Usually I don`t like these kinds of movies, but in a strange way this film was different. The time just flew away, this i a must see movie. So if you haven`t seen it yet, so go and rent it, you will not regret it.	10
 Makes you think.	Based on the Stephen King Short Story, This movie, a prison story is a unique tale of a man wrongfully placed in prison, who was married and wife murdered by someone else. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins plays the lead parts  and makes this a movie worth seeing.	10
 full of surprises	"I think this is an excellent film, I'm a bit of a ""prison film freak"" so among all prison films I'll rate this one as the second best. obviously Escape from Alcatraz with Clint Eastwood is the absolute best one! Well back to Shawshank.. The way the film is made is just extraordinary!! I Love the way Morgan Freeman plays his sympathetic character.. last part is a bit disappointing, cause it's too similar to escape from Alcatraz.Well anyway it'll get *******/**********"	10
 The Best Movie of 1994	With all due respect to Forrest Gump, this was the real best picture of 1994. Tim Robbins gives the best performance of his career, and Morgan Freeman is his usually outstanding self. The story is totally engrossing, and never loses your attention. And if you are watching the movie for the first time, the ending will throw you for a loop. This is one of the most underrated films of all time. It deserves must more respect than it usually receives.	10
 One of the best films of the 90's	Rarely a movie that tries to be touching achives its purpose.  More often then not I find myself wanting to throw up at the serious of movies. While Shawshank redemption was very touching, I was to busy being engaged in the story line and the charecters to worry about the inspirational aspect of the movie.  Every single character serves a purpose in this movie.  Tim Robbins gives a great performance as an innocent man in prison for the murder of his wife.  His character doesn't dread on the horrible reality that is before him, he just takes it.  His character seems so loss in his new reality and needs some guidence which he finds in other inmates.  Shawshank redemption offers a realistic view of prison life, and at the same time creates one of the most engaging storylines ever.	10
" Totally transcends its ""prison drama"" subgenre--one of the best films ever!"	**POSSIBLE SPOILERS (nothing too specific)**Watching The Shawshank Redemption is a downright religious experience; it is truly a film to treasure, and one that nobody who sees it will ever forget. Director Frank Darabont's translation of a Stephen King novella to the screen is not a great film because of the story itself-the plot is actually quite simple and could be carried out in under an hour with relative ease-but because of the way the story unfolds.  Shawshank is a lengthy film (clocking in around 150 minutes), but it doesn't feel so long because the leading actors are spot-on perfect, the pace is beautifully metered, and the emotions (which are never the least bit contrived) build to one of the tensest climaxes in American cinema.The story is told not from the perspective of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), banker imprisoned for a double-homicide he didn't commit, and the main character in this epic tale, but from the perspective of Red (Morgan Freeman), `the only guilty man in Shawshank Prison.'  Red has been in Shawshank for twenty years; he's a well-liked inmate among his peers because he's the guy that can obtain some of the luxuries of the outside world. If you want a box of cigars or a poster of your favorite pin-up girl, Red's your man.  Often, throughout the course of the film, we wonder why Andy isn't telling the story-after all, he's the character we sympathize with most.  In the end, we know why, and we're glad Red told the story, since the film ends up being more about him than Andy.  Andy, instead, is just the vehicle for Red's realization that hope and perseverance can free the human mind.While Red is the resourceful handyman, Andy is the smartest man in Shawshank.  He hatches a plan to get the other inmates to accept him by having the guards provide them with alcohol, he comes to be the tax preparer for all the guards in Shawshank as well as several neighboring prisons, he revamps the prison library, and even becomes the personal accountant to the warden, a cold man who, we learn, is just as criminal as any inmate.  Yet all the while, we don't realize just how smart Andy Dufresne is.  We believe he'll get his revenge on the legal system that landed him in jail, but this movie isn't about vengeance.  It's about making the most of a bad situation, and about the lengths a person will go to free himself-physically and spiritually.The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards in 1994 and lost all of them, mostly to Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction (both solid films in their own right).  In any other year it may have won all seven.  Freeman definitely deserved every possible accolade for his performance, while Darabont's direction and Roger Deakins' stark cinematography bring great effect to the story.  The Shawshank Redemption is one of the most successful films ever on video, and rightfully so.  It's one of the best films ever.	10
 The most moving film in history.		10
 Simply The Best	Shawshank Redemption is - no doubt- one of the best films I've ever watched. Not only the quality of the performance of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins but also the most amazing and interesting screenplay makes film worth watching. The film surpasses  Papillon(Butterfly) - one of the best jail-escape film ever shot - in many aspects. Dustin Hoffman and Steve Mcqueen are both fine actors with a couple of Oscar Nominations but Morgan freeman is surely the real suit for the role. Tim Robbins amazes the audience with his cold-blooded behaviours from the very beginning till the end of the film. If you haven't watched the film yet, it's the one you should borrow at first chance.	10
 He liked it no, he loved it, hope he's not obtuse.	The best prisons in the world seem to have a crawl space behind the wall though which only the most deserving souls can escape.  Granted, in this case it required a number of years, a few laundryroom visits by the sodomites and the execution of a key witness before the final crawl to freedom could take place. All in all a great movie with that Papillon good feeling of freedom at last. Love it I do.	
 Quite possibly the greatest movie in existence.		
 Chick flick, minus the chick		10
 Shawshank and Society		
 great movie	I saw this movie about a week ago and I really enjoyed it. I also have the movie and I've seen it about three or four times. It was also on TV. Morgan Freeman was terrific as Red. I think that everybody should watch this movie. 10/10	10
 Mind Blowing, especially the first time!		10
 Magnificent!	I have seen this movie now a couple of times and I can say that it is one the best movies ever made! It's not an ordinary movie, it's something special. Both Robbins and Freeman did an Outstanding role and that's one thing why I love this movie so much. This is timeless movie, one and only of a kind. This should be on everyones must see list! Superb..	10
 Better every time i see it.	This is one of the great films of all time. One of the 10 best I've ever seen. The cast is perfect. Tim Robbins was great! So too were Morgan Freeman as Red (a part actually written for a red haired Irishman) and Bob Gunton as the Warden. James Whitmore shows that small parts still require great acting and he is as good as ever. I recommend this film highly.	10
 One of the greatest movies ever made	Excellent stars and supporting actors make this a once-in-a-lifetime type movie. The script was so well written it made it seem as if everyone was actually inmates in Shawshank. Every time the movie comes on tv I watch it and at the end STILL cry of happiness. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are outstanding together!	
 best movie ever!	better than any movie out there. this is the best of the best. frank darabont did a great job adapting stephen king's novella. it's the great story and acting that make the film what it is - a masterpiece. i'm just surprised forrest gump beat the movie in the oscars - NOT RIGHT! Shankshank should've received BEST screenplay, director and film.	10
 Amazing Film, more drama than a high school romance	This is probably my favorite film and deserves all credit is gets on this site and more.  It gets no mentioning from AFI or other official lists, but I would easily put it in the top 10.  It is probably the most riveting story in a movie ive seen, from the beginning you are on Tim Robbins side and how can you deny that both he and Morgan Freeman give the best performances of their lives.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	"The first time I've seen this movie was on December 31st, 2001. My parents and I were getting ready to down to the city and celebrate the New Year.My father said it was a great film and it was just on TNT or TBS. I decided to watch it, and wow. This has to be the greatest film of all-time.The acting was excellent, the directing, the writing. Everything. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gave excellent jobs. On my all-time favorites list, this ranks #3...1. ""Rat Race"" (2001) 2. ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) 3. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) 4. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) 5. ""Spider-Man"" (2002)The only bad aspect of the film was that the ending was too weak.SPOILER ALERTWhen Freeman's character met Robbin's character on the beach, it was just dull. I don't even think they ever said a word. They just faded out. Couldn't they have shown what happens next? Oh, well.SPOILER ALERT OVER.Everything else was great and there were even some funny moments, like when the Prison owner guy found out how Robbins' character left the prison.Since 12/31/01, I've seen the movie four more times, bought the screenplay and bought the DVD.10/10"	10
 On of my all time favs!	This movie is so timeless...it is definitely an instant classic. This isn't even my type of movie, but if you have a heart, you will be extremely moved by this touching story. I would never hesitate in recommending this movie to anyone!	10
 I'm so glad a site has this near the top	This is by far my favorite film, if not the best ever made. The direction and acting is beyond description, to the point where it could have been a silent film and we still would have known what was going on. A most triumphant start to a career for Frank Darabont, who has taken Stephen King's novella of about a hundred pages and made it into a masterpiece. It's about time a website ranked this movie towards its top, because that's exactly where it deserves to be. 10/10.	10
 Replay Value: Forever	This movie makes me feel like the energizer bunny - I can keep watching and watching and watching...It's incredible.  The Shawshank Redemption is of the few movies which I can watch always, even if I know what's coming.	10
 Simply Fabulous	Awesome Movie. Great performances by the whole acting cast especially Freeman and Robbins. I thought the warden was an excellent played character also. The screenwriting was awesome. Too bad this movie was out the same time as Forrest Gump or perhaps it would of had way more accolades. Still one of the greatest movies ever.	9
 The antidote to all action stunt fests	"I won't say it's the best film ever, but The Shawshank Redemption is certainly the best film *I've* ever seen.  There are no big stunts, no state-of-the-art special effects, no naked women.... In fact there are none of the things that are normally ""required"" to make a film commercial. (Perhaps this accounts for its modest showing at the box office.)  What it *has* got is humanity, subtlety and a great story with a brilliant payoff! One of the first DVDs I ever bought and by far the most played."	
 A really amazing film about friendship and perseverence.	There is just so much good in this film.I'm really surprised that it is ranked as highly as it is.  I don't agree that it is the second best film of all time.  I do think it is an extraordinary movie, tho.I could go on and on about it, but many other people have already done that. But it is obligatory to say something, isn't it?  How about:You can make this movie very strange by getting lightly buzzed and pretending that Tim Robbin's character is actually Nuke Laloosh from Bull Durham.  ;)	8
 Once upon a time, you find a great story where each picture tells more than 1,000 words...		9
 Probably the best for me...ever.	Perhaps the most thoughtful, entertaining, and emotionally powerful and moving movie I have ever seen. There is nothing like both of the performances put forth from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. I am inspired every time I watch the movie, and will keep going back for inspiration again and again...Truly a remarkable piece of filmaking; I believe it is one of the best movies ever made.	10
 review of a bad review	"Contains Spoilers 1.- The reason there was no racial tension was that in 1940-60s Maine, the black population was less than 1%, in one of the most conservative states, so, no, there was not much racial tension; and so, after a month, Andy asks him to get the hammer, he just didn't walk up to him the first day there. I was in lockup for a night in Louisville KY with 30 others and in an hour I was BSin with a homie who got popped with 6 ounces of blow.  I got nailed for not producing a valid license.(left it in the hotel).2.- All the relevant (except ""the sisters"") prisoners were criminals, and doing time, and were not saints.3.- Andy can get a REAL (not fake) driver's license and S.S. number for a bogus identity. Granted this is a movie, but yes, you can get real documents by mail. He was in prison for years before he started his phantom identity, he would have been able to ask any con for help. And THEIR picture would never end up on the license, because they didn't start putting photos on licenses until the 70s and 80s. This was the 40s - 60s, when white collar crime was just starting to expand.4.- He doesn't get gang-raped many times and doesn't end up traumatized. He fought them off.5.- A white yuppie banker can pull off what none of the lifers can? And the ""he never lost hope"" excuse don't cut it.  Because it's a movie.6.- The prison guards NEVER once open up his books (where he kept the rock hammer). At any prison of medium security the raids include the books as well, never mind a maximum security facility.  Because it's a movie.7.- Red remembers Andy's instructions EXACTLY, even when these were told to him only once and at a relaxed, casual moment. And after months, the place Andy described remained THE SAME. Remember Andy told him right before he escaped and Red was paroled soon after.What bothers me about bad reviews is distorting the facts to make up the bad review."	
 Doesn't need to redeem itself for anything, it's perfect.	****Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and Bob Gunton.The story follows Andy Dufresne, a man wrongfully accused of murdering his wife, but he is really innocent.  He befriends a few prisoners, and then finds a way to escape the prison.The movie is one of the greatest movies of all time.  It has every single element that makes this wonderful.Very highly recommended.	
 Incredibly intense prison movie	What is so special about this movie? Thats what I asked myself when I saw it as one of the few IMDB top-rated movies I didn't know yet. Now I know why it deserves to be there. It is the best prison movie ever made. Most prison movies try to accuse the prison system by showing an increasing level of violence and spectacular escapes. Shawshank Redemption is somewhat different. The main actor is portrayed from the view of a second person and most of the time we see what this person sees. Shawshank prison is not a monastery, and while there are some violent scenes, most of the violence we only learn by the narrative of the second person. The time saved from depicting violence is spent showing the feelings of the inmates. Beyond the perfect technical work in producing this movie, the plot slowly builds up to incredible moments of courage and purity. I guess this is what essentially makes the movie so great, without being pathetic the movie makes us wonder about our own motives and decisions. Very thought provoking.	10
 In time, this masterpiece may be considered the greatest movie ever made	The Shawshank Redemption is not only the greatest film of the last decade, but in time, this may become, in the eyes of moviegoers, the best movie ever made.  The story of wrongfully accussed banker Andy Dufresne, and his friendship formed with con Ellis Boyd Redding in Shawshank Prison, has become as universally acclaimed and loved as any other in recent history. This is the 'Casablanca' of it's time.  A near-perfect movie that can be watched hundreds of times and never lose it's impact.  Perhaps its the way the movie handles the timeless theme of hope, and the trials one man has to endure to be attain the proverbial redemption of the title.  Maybe it is because this movie is truth, simple truth, about the triumph of good over evil, the triumph of reason over madness, the triumph of hope over everything.	10
 Excellent	This movie is excellent.  It really makes you feel good.  It's about hope, the fight for life and most of all, poetical justice.  Excellent performances by the cast, visually stunning and has a great deal of realism in it.  I totally recommend it.  A+	10
 Breath-taking, Simply Brilliant!	The Shawshank Redemption was story about how perseverance, hope and innocence will change a man's destiny. Tim Robbins was eloquent and portrayed a character with acting prowess of razor sharp perfection. Wrongly accused of murdering his wife, he ends up in Shawshank Maximum Security Prison, for life. Here here he befriends Red, played by Morgan Freeman ( a role he definitely deserved the Best Supporting Actor Oscar ), your typical Jack of all traits in the prison. Their story was one of trust, hope and friendship which was ultimately the forte of this movie. Robbins acting was methodical, straight-foward and deservingly captures our sympathy. A great supporting cast also gives added strength to an already perfect movie. The background music score haunts me even until today as it successfully depicts the sad, helpless and claustrophobic mood of a maximum security prison. Rich, crisp and vibrant cinematography together with Director Frank Darabont's vivid imagination and direction style  brought to life one of the greatest motion picture ever told! 10/10	10
 Always worth seeing		10
 Guilty as charged?	I dont mean to be controversial here, but I read the book some time ago, and over the last couple of days, watched the film again. And nowhere I can remember, can it conclusively prove that Andy Dufrene did NOT kill his wife and that Glen geezer. All we have to go on is him saying that he didn't and the fact that we all like him as a character. Yes it does seem against his nature, but a lot of murders must be against peoples nature's, but they still happen.Anyone else agree that he could be the killer?	
 beautiful	"Shawshank Redemption is a compelling, moving, and beautiful story which is darkly funny at times. This movie's #2 spot on IMDB is debatable, since it is essentially a formulaic Hollywood story with Hollywood characters... i.e. evil institution (guards) and noble rebels (""some"" prisoners) within a microcosm (prison). Andy Dufresne is so incredibly friggin' smart (for a banker) that is almost super-hero like. Though this is definitely a worthy film, in terms of sheer greatness, Shawshank missed Cool Hand Luke by *this much*... If you want a really top-of-the-line awesome prison movie, Cool Hand Luke is the one to see."	9
 Sad one line summary		8
 Best ever, but why???	"At first I just want to say that this is and always be the best film ever until the opposite is proved. I have only one question after watching it:The scene when Andy gets to Shawshank, Red already telling us (as a speaker) ""... when Andy wanted Rita Hayworth, I said No problem"" (sorry if I´m a bit wrong in the quote) W H Y on earth is he doing that? Why does Frank Darabont want us to know that before he actually does the scene later in the movie???Answer anyone?? ... but still... Best ever. Got it on DVD as a Christmas present from my brother after tearing the videotape out through the years. Thanks Bro! =Calle="	10
 Gets better every time I see it		10
 Hard to describe the emotions	*** SPOILERS *** I just finished watching Shawshank for the third time. Even though I know exactly what's going to happen in every part of the movie, some scenes are so beautiful and powerful that they still make me cry. The first 30 minutes of the film feels like a normal prison film, nothing special, but a good build up for things to come. The film really starts taking off with the scene where they work on the roof. After that it just gets better and better. In the end you are overwhelmed with the beauty of this movie.My favourite parts are when they are working in the roof, when Brooks is released, when Tommy gets shot in the yard, the part where Red describes how Andy escaped and the part where Red find the note under the rock. Every scene in the movie is great and most of them are relevant to the main story. The narration by Freeman is great, I can't think of any other film that contains so many wonderful quotes. The music is also beautiful and fits perfectly into the movie.It's very hard to tell with words how good this movie is. Just go watch the movie and hopefully you will feel the same things I feel.	
 A very moving motion picture.	The Shawshank Redemption is, by far, one of the greatest films of the 90's, if not of all time. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are perfect as the two leads in this very moving, human story. With excellent direction (Frank Darabont), a fantastic story (a short by Stephen King), and a great supporting cast, this film is a masterpiece.	10
 Not just the other prison movie Stephen King wrote		9
 Hope springs eternal in prison	No spoilers here.A remarkable Stephen King penned story.  King has often found ways of getting to wonder about even our most strongly held values.  Most consider people in prison as throwaway members of society, and those that guard the prisons as public servants. King twists this into the protagonist prisoner (Robbins) against the hopelessness of prison and the brutal display of power by the warden.  The story is beautifully narrated by Morgan Freeman as ex-con Red.It lost out to Tom Hanks' portrayal of Forrest Gump for Best Picture, which is a shame, but I'll never forget the impact it made on me.The film has an edge, and a heart.  I couldn't recommend it enough.	10
 Outstanding Film	Recently on cable television, this classic movie has stirred the hearst of many.  It is a very compelling film, and it arouses one's emotions to their zenith.  The casting is perfect, the performances are the penultimate of theatre, and the result is a must-see drama that belongs in the DVD library of all serious collectors.	10
 The best movie I've ever seen	This was a movie I wanted to see for some time, and when I finally got to see it it didn't disappoint me. On the contrary, it was the best movie I've ever seen.Very good story. This is a movie I'll watch a lot more... the best ever!	10
 The best movie--caution could contain spoilers!!	This movie is the best movie around. Tim Robbins plays his character superbly (is that a word??). Morgan Freeman was an awesome choice for Red. At first glance, I thought is was a so-so movie. Then I saw it again, and again. The plot became so intricate; instead of being about Andy and his trying to find the truth, it became about Red and his own internal struggle.Anyway, I recommend this movie for anyone who loves movies of any kind.	10
 A message of hope, well recieved	At one time this movie was my faveorite of all time, but then I saw it repeated 2000 times on Turner's cable networks.  Although the book by Stephen King is much better than the movie, the message that hope lives on, remains.  I have to admit that I never liked Tim Robbins untill I saw this movie, but I thought he did an excellent job in what is one of the great movies of the nineties.	10
 Uplifting story of hope and the resilience of the human spirit.	"This movie was faithful to the excellent Stephen King novella it came from:""Rita Hayward and the Shawshank Redemption"".  In spite of injustice, corruption, and brutality, prisoners were able to rise above this and form true friendships.  They were able to put real love into action toward each other.  When the protagonist, played brilliantly by Tim Robbins, locks himself in the warden's office and plays an exquisite aria from a Mozart opera, the whole prison stops and listens.  All are moved by such beauty, beauty they haven't experienced in a long time, if ever.  It is my favorite scene from any movie I have ever seen."	10
 Quite possibly the best movie of all time...		10
 One of the greatest movies ever!	"This is an example that Hollywood CAN do a great movie that doesn't solely build on special effects.This is also a proof that not all movies need to have more ""pace"" or ""action"". The ingredients in this movie is the interaction between two great actors, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, a very good support cast, a superb story by Stephen King and a professional crew. This ""soup"" is very tasteful and gets 10/10 by me."	10
 I don't know why I had to wait eight years to see it.	***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***One of my friends raved about this film so I looked it up on IMDB and there it was at no 2 in the top 250 movies with over 42000 people giving it 10 out of 10 so I gave it a try and wished I had watched it years ago.Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red both give first class performances and the friendship that develops between them is heartfelt, Especially when you feel that two people of completely different social standings that would not pass the time of day on the outside world bond so well in the confinements of shawshank prison. There is no facetious acting and even the scenes where Andy is violated by the `sisters'  there are no grisly scenes but still the viewer is left in no doubt what took place. some people call it bland but to me it adds to the appeal  of the film and in-keeping with time scale the film was set in.This story appeals on so many levels and I can see why its in the top ten films in IMDB and the tag line It takes a strong man to save himself, and a great man to save another completely captures the film essence and I know it will not be 8 years before I watch it again. But having to wait years to watch it I must qualify for the sadster of the year award !!9/10	9
 Reviews by Joe, Steve, Derek, Brad, Dan, Chris	CONTAINS SPOILERS Review by Joe: `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' the original short novel by legendary author Stephen King, sparked the start of a superb movie and ongoing legend. Andrew Dufresne, a fairly young man committed murder and was sentenced to life in Shawshank prison.  There are some elements of this film that differ from elements of this novel.  And yet many things are the same.In the novel, Andy was a short, partially bald man, who was quiet and shy, and in the movie he was a tall intimidating stocky figure.  I think this difference is important in one particular scene: the prisoners are tarring the roof, and Andy overhears Hadley, a man who is angry at the world, talking about his inheritance from his deceased brother.  Andy speaks up about the taxes of the inheritance and Hadley gets furious.  I think that if in the movie he was the man described in the book, it would have made this seem weak, and Hadley probably wouldn't have thought him worthy to even speak to him. I think this movie was put together well, but to be honest, I like Stephen King's short novel better.Review by Steve: The movie was very good.  Andy's life in prison was real.  Andy really got cheated out of 20 years of his life.  Andy's in jail for something he didn't do. I especially like the scene when the warden was talking to the media. When the warden was in front of the building talking it looked like the warden had a crown on.  Showing that he was a king he had all the power. I didn't like the ending of the movie.  It was good for them because it was what they both wanted. They both wanted freedom and that's what that scene showed.  But they should have had some sort of action, like gone sailing, fishing, showed them both out to sea doing something.  Being free.  Not just on the beach hugging each other.Review by Derek: I think that the directors should have filmed the movie in Charleston, Maine because I've spent a lot of time there.  I wish I would have had a chance to see the whole movie but from what I saw it was a great movie. I liked the movie cause it seemed so real.  But what I didn't like was how the guards and the warden thought that any one who got in the way or their business they could kill them or put them in solitary confinement.  Plus I didn't like how guards treated inmates like slaves. They couldn't just face reality and treat them like equals. But it happens in prisons all over the world so that's why I liked Shawshank Redemption.Review by Brad: I liked the movie compared to the book.  I think that the movie was way better. The movie seemed to be way more interesting.  It was complimentary to Stephen King's ways of writing an intricate portrayal of an actual event that took place in Maine. One of the things I liked about the movie is the way camera angles portray power.Review by Dan: A Review of Shawshank Redemption from an Inmate's View I found the movie not nearly as enjoyable as Stephen King's `Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption'.  The points I found I did not agree with are they have Red's character as a black man in the movie when in the short story he was a white Irish man but it kinda adds a little laughter to a serious theme.  Second they have Andy Dufresne as a tall skinny man when in `Rita Hayworth.' he's a small and a heavy man with not much of an aura. Thirdly they have one warden Mr. Norton when there is three in the short story because it seems to the viewer that 19 years did not go by, but in a way its good so the viewer can focus his hate towards one figure. That's what I didn't like but there are more pros than cons.  The film makers did an excellent job with the lighting, the angle of the camera and the music. With these three combined it gives the feelings of dread and despair as black as death.  Freedom as high as a bird and sadness as deep as an ocean. With all these in mind it makes a great movie on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it 8 ½.Review by Chris: This movie was madcool. Some specific parts about this movie that I thought were pretty phat was like when the music was played by the Italian lady's singing and they all looked free.  When later on in the movie the music is really fast and strong after he's finished climbing out of the pipe and really is free.  I also like how Andy never gave up against the sisters and then finally Hadley beat the p*** out of Boggs,the guards helped him because he helped them that's pretty killer.Madcool-really good, very interesting Phat-cool interesting, awesome, madcool Pretty Killer-same	10
 Get Busy or Get Busy Living	"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!! Frank Darabont's brilliant adaptation form the Stephen King novel Different Seasons, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" captures the audience's attention and does not let go.  As in ""The Green Mile"", Darabont takes us through a journey of an innocent man confined to prison walls.  The film begins with Andy Dufresne  (Tim Robbins)  being found guilty of two counts of murder and shipped off to Shawshank Prison.  There we meet Red Redding (Morgan Freeman).  Andy and Red begin a memorable friendship that is evident though out the film.  The corrupt warden (Bob Gunton) makes Andy's life miserable. Over the years, we see Andy growing, getting books for the prison library, and teaching his follow inmates.  We see Red going to the parole board and never allowed freedom.  Darbont has the audience hoping that he is finally going to be released.  More years past and Andy decides to get busy dying or get busy living.  Suddenly, we hear sirens going off and the warden shooting himself for a cowardly way out for his dirty deeds.  Andy escapes.  But how does he do it?  Telling us how Andy crawls his way to freedom, Red begins to narrate the rest of the film. After nineteen years, Andy obtains his revenge and freedom at the same time.  The steps at which Andy takes to escape leaves the audience speechless.  Red begins to miss his friend and every once in awhile he would get a plain postcard, which we all knew was from Andy.  Red is once again sent before the parole board.  He tells them what he thinks of them. They finally parole him.   The audience can not get any happier.  Andy and Red are free.  Yet Andy told Red about a place he loved to go the night before he escaped.  Red hitchhikes to that place and finds a tin box.  Inside the old wore out box is money and the place Red could find Andy.  Red takes a bus to a beautiful place by the ocean.  As Red walks the beach, we see Andy. The film is long but, the time flies because the audience is into the movie.  The performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are phenomenal. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one film a person can keep watching because everyone always finds themselves still rooting for Andy who finally got busy living."	
 Truly redemptive	To me, it's the supporting cast and the attention to detail in this time period movie that make it an outstanding movie.  It's in a class with The Godfather and A Man For All Seasons.  Outstanding finish after considering how we viewers suffered through the prisoners' treatment at the hands of the guards and administration.	9
 Not just a great prison movie, one of the great movies of all time.		
 Great movie	What can I say that hasn't already been said. A fantastic movie which has been played to death on TNT. Still, it's a great film. One of those films that jocks say is their favorite film to show they're film buffs. Anyway, a great movie with a lot of heart.	
 BAD TITLE, GREAT FILM	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of my favorite films. It was filmed in and around where I live (in Ohio), and I have actually visited the old prison where they shot much of the movie. I would love to know where they filmed the scene where Andy buried the letter and money in that countryside. It looks very familiar.  Anyway, I thought Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were at their best, and had great chemistry together. The casting, so important to making a film work, was well done.  Bob Gunton ,as the warden, does a great job. There is something intriging about escaping from a hopeless situation and changing your destiny. This is the first Steven King work I have actually enjoyed. Also, the background music really adds to the overall enjoyment and quality of the film. I am glad to see it is also considered one of the greatest films of all times by others."	10
 Human relationships as they are!	One of the greatest movies of all time! The back bone of the film is the relationship between the two characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman(both, great acting) .I like the way their friendship is depicted.How it evolves and stuff.Couldn't be more similar to life!Anyway it is a kickass movie!No-one should regret the time they spent on this!	10
 Overrated??? Try UNDERRATED!!!	I'd like to remind those few Nay Sayers that have labeled SSR as an overrated film that it sure wasn't overrated by the Academy in 1994. In fact, it didn't win a single Oscar! Thanks to IMDB, the public has spoken -it's truly a People's Choice! Obviously, we each have a right to our opinion, and I respect (though cannot understand) the opinions of those that have expressed dissent about the film. Rather than remain in a quandary as to how it could have been elevated to number 2 all-time, perhaps you should try watching the film again to see if, by chance, you missed the boat on it the first time around. There's no vote-fixing going on here, folks! I stand in harmony among those who have been enlightened by this masterpiece and lend my hand in lifting it to the top.	10
 How can anyone hate this movie?	Its understandable, I guess, to dislike this movie, but how can anyone truly hate this movie. There is nothing to hate. Anyways, did anyone notice in this movie that the warden aged a little, but the captain of the guards(played by Clancy Brown) did not. The story started in 1947 and ended in 1966. Did anyone notice this?10/10	10
 Loved it!	The movie was just brilliant. Just the right actors had been picked and the movie was just great. I recommend sincerely if you haven't already seen it.	10
 Just emotions - if someone need more comments	"First of all: this film is one of the ""must see"".It's not just a collection of perfect moments. It's not just a work of good teammates. It's a single moment from the start till the begining when you live along with the characters of the film.And the last but not the least: it very hard to make film after strong book. Different seasons is worth reading and definitely very impressive. When I watched the start I honestly doubted that it will impress me that strong."	9
 Very good		10
 One of the best movies I have ever seen	I have seen The Shawshank Redemption after noticing that it was second in the 250 Top Movies and I must say I have no regrets about this. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies ever made and I am glad to add it to my collection. If you haven't seen it yet get it and watch it.	10
 Set in a prison, but about triumphing over any adversity	"An excellent tale about enduring incredibly adversity and eventually triumphing.  The incomparable Morgan Freeman sets the tone as narrator. This should not be seen as a ""prison"" movie, even though it is set in a prison.  Tim Robbins, as the other major character and the man whose trials rival those of Job, is a good everyman.  When this film was nominated for a lot of Oscars, Kathie Lee Gifford made a great show of ridiculing its title (on ""Live with Regis and..."").  She hadn't seen the movie and would probably be embarrassed to be reminded of the episode."	9
 The Greatest.	This is a moving picture that will leave you with an experience. There are still films I need to see, but so far this ranks as without a doubt my favourite. No other film has provided me with such a tremendous emotional rush in its last third, or set itself up so well to do so with everything before it. A fantastic story told by the best of direction, acting and music. The Greatest.	10
 Amazing movie	"Tim forehead robbins does a classic job as a hot shot banker who was wrongfully accused.  in this crusade robbins and ""Red"" morg freeman become good buds and with william sadlers upraving comedic factor the movie simply goes down as one of the greatest philms of all time. frank darabonts finest film and bub gunton plays a great role as the warden."	
 I always get goosebumps.	"While ""the Godfather"" is the current number 1, I have to say that, although I love the Godfather, it never gives me the same feeling as ""The Shawshank Redemption"". It gives me goosebumps everytime I see it. You actually pitty the inmates, even when you know what they did. But the best part of the experience is the way the story let's you be Red and look at the terribly strange new inmate and watch him give everyone a better life."	10
 Good film but there are a lot better		
 Will we ever see it's like again?	"For me this film is about as close to perfection as I can imagine. Somehow a first time director's adaptation of a fairly average and forgotten novella by a horror writer has turned out to be one of the most beloved movies ever made. Watching this film is truly a magical and life affirming experience, which profoundly affected me after seeing it for the first time. Andy's journey as he crawls through ""a river of s*** and comes out clean on the other side"" as red puts it, has become an inspiration to millions of people. The film's central message, that hope can lead us by the hand through the darkest times in our lives, and give us the courage to go on, is surely one of the most eloquent and beautiful sentiments ever delivered through the media of cinema. This film has become a modern phenomenon, a cultural benchmark, and has proved the incredible power that movies still posses."	10
 10 out of 10	"this movie has it all.  it has an exraordinary plot and the storyline between morgan freeman and tim robbins is one that i have never seen before. no movie has a ""buddy to buddy"" relationship as in this movie.  this movie made me cry at the end, although to be honest, it was kidna predictable how he would redeem himself.  the ending was also predictiable, but still, why does a movie not have to be predictable to be great?  being predicatble makes the viewer happy that the movie is headed in a happy direction."	10
 I movie that reminds us why we love Cinema		10
 Absolutely cracking cinema classic	Shawshank Redemption is the greatest prison film ever made, in fact it is probably the greatest film ever made. Morgan Freeman is absolutely brilliant and is mirrored by a surprising Tim Robbins this is a devastating, heartwarming, riveting cinema at its very best everyone will remember this film 10/10 and justifiably so.	10
 My favorite film.	"WARNING:***SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*** DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIEI originally rented this film because I had read it was an escape movie. That was all I had really heard about it.  The title didn't seem very familiar to me, but I thought I would rent it.  I was slightly worried that I had ruined the ending for myself, but I was worrying for nothing.  From the very first scene the movie had me.  Morgan Freeman's performance was PERFECT.  The music was great.  The plot was surprisingly varied and it pulled me in.  And  of course the escape scene was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen in a movie anywhere.  The plot is so simple.  A man beats the system.  It affects anyone who is human.  If you have disregarded my warning and are reading it without seeing it, don't worry.  I haven't ruined it. This is one movie that has to be experienced.  There is absolutely nothing else I can say.  Those of you have seen it will know what I'm talking about. It seems like I'm at a loss for words, and that's true.  Everyone must see this movie.  If you haven't seen it, stop reading, go out, and rent it or buy it or borrow it or steal it or download it-just see it.  This is worth any rental price.  It sounds simplistic to the point of irrevelence.  It sounds like any other movie.  It sounds boring.  BUT ITS NOT.  It's beautiful!  It's perfect!  My writing skills are usually much better than this, but I can't fit this movie into words.  JUST SEE IT. NOW.  ""Get busy living, or get busy dying..."""	10
 Brilliant	My friend and I have agreed that any man between the ages of 20-40 will have one or more of the following as being in their top 3 movies of all time : Star Wars, Blade Runner, Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption.A fantastic source novella, skilful direction, career performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman....the list goes on.The plot can't be summarised easily - suffice to say that there are no car chases, no gunfights, and no actors from Dawson's Creek.This movie is one of only three I can recall where I specifically noticed EVERY person leaving the cinema with a HUGE smile on their face.	10
 You will Remember this Movie!		9
 Brilliant Movie	This move is by far one of the best movies of all time. It deserves to be in the top 5. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman do an excellent job, I couldn't pick anyone else to play the role better. Their performance was outstanding. I recommend this movie to everyone, if you haven't seen it, you should.	10
 Best drama ever	"Though Freeman is our times Micheal Caine, his performance in this flick is quite sufficient or rather staggering. In Oscar terms, ""I would like to thank..."", haden't been disapointing to me. To reavel the plot or resolution is to say how ""The Mouse Trap"" ends. All I can say is see the movie. It might be a ""guy movie"" but it is the best drama ever...."	10
 Unorginal Prison Fairytale my hairy foot!	"***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** Imagine me as an old man with a beard sitting on the stoep (porch) waving my cane at people passing by.""How dare you call the Shawshank Redemption an unorginal prison fairytale! It is not supposed to be a run of the mill prison movie. Its not supposed to be The Birdman of Alcatraz! It's not supposed to be MIDNIGHT EXPRESS! It's not even supposed to be Stir Crazy, you wippersnappers! The prison is only the backdrop! It's about overcoming the odds when you are at your rope's end. This is a movie about hope and finding it in the darkest and dreariest of places.""This movie could easily have been set in Nazi Germany in opressed Germany, in a concentration camp, in a 19th century work house! It's about breaking free from things that oppress us needlessly! (Spoiler starts here) Andy is the only person in prison that doesn't belong there! If he had done something bad he would have accepted it, but he didn't, so he tunnels through a wall to freedom. (Spoiler ends here).""Sentimentalism can be bad in a movie if handled incorrectly, but Darabont uses it better than other Capra impersonators out there (even beating the Coens with their Hudsucker Proxy). And there is nothing wrong with sentimentality in The Shawshank Redemption. And I can't see what cliches you are talking about. Just because good things happen doesn't mean they cliches.""This is a meditative movie. It's also has a lot of little things to enjoy for repeat viewing. So get off your high-horse and enjoy this movie.""This is all I have to say.""Get back onto his chair and blows bubbles out of his pipe."	10
 Excellent though cliched	"An excellent adaption of Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"".Morgan Freeman is outstanding and his narrative is very lulling and makes the film all the more compelling.Tim Robbins, too, gives a fantastic performance - and the supporting cast (particularly Bob Gunton as the sadistic warden; he also appeared in the King adaption ""Dolores Claiborne"" (1995)) give fine performances, too.Despite being riddled with prison cliches, this movie is great.And remember: FEAR CAN KEEP YOU PRISONER, HOPE CAN SET YOU FREE."	7
 You must see this film!	You do not need to know about the plot or the characters or the actors, know only this:Shawshank redemption is an amazing film. You must watch this, you will not regret it.	10
 good flick	oh,this is really a very good one i've ever seen.Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.remember?from the movie,u can get that.if u never see it,go ahead now,or u will regret,i am sure.but to my disappoint,it doesn't get any awards. and when the old man left the prison,he found he was not able to touch the world,really hard for him to do that,and in the end he rather die.it truely shows many prisoner's feelings.i was deeply moved. and this is the one shows the humanity,u should watch it!	10
 How could I have missed seeing it before?	Great movie, I don't know how I missed it. Nothing was out of place, whoever casted the movie did an excellent job.It instantly became one of my top 5's. I will watch it again(I don't usually watch twice, at least right away). I'm glad I bought the DVD -can't say that about all movies.	10
 A Reflection of prison life, and what Hope is	"Though the prison system in the US may have changed by now under extreme ""political correctness"", but still ""seeing"" is believing. Twenty years are a long time, and the odds are against any one that plots an escape: the longer the time, the less believable an escape is. Perhaps the too neatly arranged escape hurt this movie's credibility, still the movie succeeded in being an entertaining window into a morbid world which may be too dark for the outside to see.  If I agree with one thing in this movie, it is ""Never give up hope"", as Andy states it."	9
 A must see...... twice!	To really appreciate this one, you cannot simply watch it once and put it back on the shelf. Instead, the first time you should watch it for enjoyment, the second time to really get the raw sensation. Every time after that is just the biggest thrill.The first time I watched this movie, I fell in love with it. But, it wasn't until the second time that I really appreciated it for all it's subtle overtones. Only then does reality slap you in the face and give you the wake-up call you've been needing.It is the type of film that allows you to try on someone else's shoe. You are exposed to a way of life which most of us will never understand and end up experiencing a really heart-felt moral joyride.And to top it all off, you have Morgan Freeman in his most powerful role yet.	10
 Instant Classic!! Robbed of Oscars	"The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are handing out the best performances of there life in this film.  Its about how a banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) goes through prison.  And along the way becomes best friends with Red(Freeman).  This story is all about hope and friendship.  This films has several very moving scenes.  From the rooftop scene to the ending (the best ending ever).  And the movie kinda has 4 endings.  (4 best endings ever).  Should have taken home best picture, original score, screenplay (Frank Darabont), and cinamitography oscars.  But was over looked by forrest gump (which is good, but not better then shawshank) and pulp fiction (still yet to see).  ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""... thats damn right.10/10   A+"	10
 Entertainment at its best	Best drama ever. I've got many favorite movies, and I've always been unable to name my all times favorite movie, since my moods change, sometimes I want comedy, sometimes action, and sometimes, drama. One thing I am sure of tho, and that's the superiority of The Shawshank Redemption amongst it's genre. It may not be completely realistic, it may have a few cliches, but I don't see why some people seem to think that an utterly entertaining and well made movie suddenly isn't just that anymore if it has a few silly things in it.For the last 12 or so years I've watched movies like a true fanatic, thousands and thousands of them, and I've pretty much seen all the ones that count. Everyone has a right to opinions, but I'm telling that you truly do think that this movie doesn't _deserve_ it's place in the top 5 of IMDB, you are clueless.	
 A Masterfully Crafted Emotional Roller Coaster Ride		10
 morgan freeman on top of his game	shawshank was one of the first videos i ever purchased.  this film has it all; great character development; poignant humor; heart-in-throat drama. this was the first time frank darabount directed a stephen king story - the second time was The Green Mile.  needless to say, the darabount-king hookup provides strong filmmaking for the theater-goer.a must see.	9
 Slaves of hope	"I think the hungarian title of this movie is more apposite: Prisoners of hope or Slaves of hope (A remény rabjai). It sounds beautiful in hungarian.This movie created a genre that can't be defined. The story is about hope, ""a good thing"" as Andy Dufrense calls it. ""Maybe the best of things"".And that's the point. Hope dies last. Every decent man should appreciate this movie."	10
 A Masterpiece	Shawshank Redemption, a true heart warming epic has sat in my heart among my favorites. Tim Robbins has given the performance of his life, even after watching the movie again and again, i cant stop thinking what he did, how patient and intelligent the guy was that even his closest friend morgan freeman cant think of what he can do or what he did. The strong dialogues and the delivery makes an unstoppable emotional attachement between the characters and audience. If you havent seen it, dont blame me why you are missing it.	10
 Webster couldn't come up with the proper words	"I am what you might call a movie fanatic.  I have literally seen thousands of movies.  I have a movie collection of over 1000 different movies.  When asked, ""what's my favorite movie?"", I can think of a favorite movie in a category, a favorite movie by a particular actor, a favorite movie in a particular year, a favorite style of movie, and a favorite in practically anything else you can think of.  However, there is only one movie that I felt it necessary to sign up for IMDb, there is only one movie that still sends chills up and down my spine when I watch it, there is only one movie that stands out among the rest, there is only one movie that leads the pack over the thousands of movies I watched in the last 9 or ten years, and there is only one movie that I can truly say is my favorite, number one movie of all time, and that movie is Shawshank Redemption.  This is my first review and when you look up the top voted lists on IMDb and you see Shawshank Redemption in the top 3, you will know that I, too, was mesmerized by this movie.  The only movie, in my opinion, that was ever worthy of a 10. Phillip"	10
 Cinematic beauty	A Masterpiece! This film possesses such beauty; the story line is amazing, the music 'rhymes' perfectly with the film en the acting performances are outstanding. There are few great films but in this case I have nothing but praise. The best film I have ever seen.	10
 superb (possible spoilers?)	The Shawshank Redemption is a superb motion picture. The story is great. I love movies like this where you root for the underdog, in this case wrongfully convicted Andy Dufresne, skillfully played by Tim Robbins. The cunning of Dufresne is amazing, and the movie throws in a nice moral lesson on the importance of friendship. Also the directing and cinematography are great.  Everyone should see this. bye.	9
 One of the best movies ever made.	WARNING, SPOILER AHEAD!  DO NOT READ UNTIL YOU HAVE SEEN THE FILM.This film is one of the most hotly contested films ever made.  Some, like myself, love it and it takes pride of place in their video, DVD collections. Others detest it and I think the reason for this is that they have completely missed the one point Mr Darabont was trying to make.The prison in the film is a representation of life itself, Andy didn't choose to be there he was put there by circumstances beyond his control. This is supposed to mean that in life sometimes thing happen to us, partners leave, jobs are lost etc.  that are beyond our control and we simply have to deal with them.  Andy makes the best life he can for himself in the situation he is in and makes a friend in Red.  He then, through his ability to maintain a level of hope that things will get better, inspires those around him by teaching Red the value of hope and teaching the ill fated Tommy to read etc.  In the end he escapes from prison and puts all that is wrong within it right.You can tell Darabont, like many of us, has had times where life seemed pointless and everything was against him.  What he tried, and succeeded, to say is no matter how bad things get if you believe that things will get better they will.I recently read that Tim Robbins frequently gets members of the public coming up to him in the street and telling him how important the film was to them.  How it helped them get through a time in their life they where truly miserable and, as his character said in the film, gave them hope.	
 Brilliant film...	The Shawshank Redemption is a brilliant, timeless story of a young man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is convicted and imprisoned for the murder of his wife. While in prison, he befriends an older black man named Red (Morgan Freeman). This film masterpiece just takes you through the years Andy spends in prison, and the hope that human spirit can keep alive even in the most hopeless circumstances. Tim Robbins exhibits a quality in this film that is inexplicable but charming. You really fall in love with his character and I genuinly believe (Robbins) acting in this film is perhaps one of the most moving performances ever caught on film. This really pushed me to respect the cast and really open my eyes to their acting abilities. This truimphant tale will leave a bittersweet trail through your heart as it did mine. ****	
 greatest	hello, this film was the most spectacular as it gives us something which captures the human spirit and triumph as in malaysia, i have been watching it hundred of times and what could i say? no other movie could beat this one even in the new millennium keep it as the memorable collection.the ending caption will cheer us all.	
 one of the greatest	If you are looking for a movie about strong human feelings you should see this one. Stories like this make you believe again in people's strength. It's amazing how faith and hope could take the character so high, up to the point of taking everything jail had for him. His need of freedom takes his mind away from that terrible place.Man, every time I see the scene where he is down the rain and he looks up, i get chickenskinned. This is a beautiful story.Everyone of the actors did a great job.	
 Brilliance to the apex		10
 Beautiful	I felt for Andy and Red throughout this movie. I wanted to help them fight the warden and those who abused them. I laughed some, I cried most but above all I believed. By the end when Andy and Red find happiness, you will be cheering for them!	
 Exemplary!	"""The Shawshank Redemption"", like ""Lord of the Rings"", is an exemplary film. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. The actors all do a fine job, from Morgan Freeman to Tim Robbins. The plot is outstanding, probably because it used one of Stephen King's best novels as a screenwrite. And the setting, well what can you say? Shows prison from a whole new standpoint. As of now, this film is tied with ""Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" for the best movie I have ever had the pleasure of viewing."	10
 A first class piece of film-making	The prision movie is one of those rare genres where more or less every film turns out to be a winner (The Great Escape, Pappilon, Midnight Express), but The Shawshank Redemption of 1994 may well take its place as the best of them all.  Frank Darabont's hugely impressive picture cuts a remarkable balance in paying attention to the harsh realities brutalities of prison life whilst also successfully conveying the power and determination of the human spirit.  Tim Robbins is Andy DeFrans, a banker sent to the maximum security Shawshank prison for life for the alleged murder of his wife and lover, where he strikes up a friendship with the seasoned convict Red (Morgan Freeman).  The film has enjoyed huge popularity and acclaim since its surprisingly passive 1994 release (perhaps due to the attention surronding Forrest Gump) and almost certainly deserves its label as a contemporary classic; few films carry such a magnetic, absorbing and attentive pull.  The result is something that not only ranks as great entertainment but a chance for the viewer themselves to enjoy and appreciate a first-class piece of screenwriting and film-making.	
 One of the best movies I have ever seen.		
 One of the best of the last 30 years	Best prison movie since The Great Escape.  One of the most satisfying climaxes of any movie ever made.  Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar for best actor.  Relative unknown Bob Gunton (one of those actors you see, but you never know his name) is also brilliantly despicable as Warden Samuel Norton.  Like many classics, despite its modest box office appeal, Shawshank will grow in stature through the years and will be recognized as an all time great.	10
 easily the best from stephen king...	watch it twice, thrice or how many ever times, the shawshank redemption is one movie that you can never call boring, especially for the way it has dealed with abstract terms like humanity and hope. the movie does have its flaws such as Red being the only guy who's hair has greyed after 33 yrs in prison. but then, when you watch such a great movie, these flaws are easily to be forgotten.what is to be remembered is the victory of the human spirit.	10
 Live it!	I've never imagined movie with such great depth, this one moved me!I think this must be some serious piece of film making in a long time. At some point of the film, I even felt like I'm a part of the movie. (I laughed with Andy and his pals at their lunch when they are talking about a 'new fish'. Wait a minute, I'm a prisoner!?)So when you're in the midst of hopelessness, this would be your life jacket.Cheers! (At the rooftop)	10
 Simply Amazing!	I watched Shawshank right after it's release on VHS and was completely overtaken by it. I went out and bought the video as soon as I could and to this day it remains the gem of my collection. It is simply the greatest movie ever made. No matter how many times I watch this film, it seems to get even better than the last. There isn't a single flaw anywhere in this movie! The greatest aspect though is Morgan Freemans narration. Nobody should go without seeing this movie at least once.	10
 Beautifully intelligent story	"This very sophisticated and beautifully storytelling, the way a great movie is supposed to be.When I saw the trailers and clips from this movie when it was first released, I thought to myself; ""Yeah right, another self-conscious Oscar-nominated prison dirge with it's heart fastened firmly to it's sleeve"".  I expected it to be another ""worthy"" movie like CHATTAHOOCHEE or the usual 80s telemovie types.  It wasn't until I sat down and watched the tv release that i really got involved with the story.I particularly like the way the story has heart and feelings, but is not sappy or pretentious.  There is humour, pathos, tragedy, and irony in equal measure.  So if you're like me and usually don't like ponderous prison dramas, I reckon you should see this movie anyway, and you should  find that it's surprizingly refreshing storytelling."	9
 AMAZING movie	I cannot believe this movie came out in 1994 and I just saw it for the first time today. I have been missing out! This is my new favorite movie of all time. If you haven't seen this movie yet,you MUST see it. It's Morgan Freeman's best work ever and he should have gotten an oscar for it. I have never liked Tim Robbins,but his performance deserved an oscar also.	10
 All Time Classic	This has to be my favourite film from a Steven King novel and one of my all time top ten.  The story is fantastically told and the acting brilliant-a real credit to one of the best stories for a long time.  I wont spoil the storyline for anyone who wasn't watched it but suffice to say you will not be disappointed.	10
 Unbelievable!	Now, when i first was getting ready to watch this movie i didnt think it would be very good. But when i saw it i knew i was wrong. I think this is the best movie ever made. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins were perfect together. I have never seen a better on screen team!! YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!	10
 Why I watch movies...	This is why people watch movies.  To escape from everyday life and sit completely absorbed in someone else's story.  And what a wonderful story it is.  On the outside it looks to be a sap of movie, the kind of movie that shamelessly wants to jerk some tears.  But it bold enough to break free from the prison of other formula films.  The cliches are all there and in familiar places but on a higher level and they are warm and welcome.  This is the kind of movie that I will finish watching and feel the need to rewind it and play it again.  This is truly one for the ages.	10
 No good thing ever dies...		10
 Simply Stunning	Just when one had thought no one can best outstanding movies like the Godfather along comes a movie like Shawshank, which simply blows the mind. It is a masterpiece of movie making and one which I never hesitate to watch - again and again. As long as movies like this come along every once in a few years, I will always have faith in the movies	
 Shawshank is the best movie.	The Shawshank Redemption was ,is and will always be the best movie ever. It has everything, drama, comedy, action, suspense,  adventure, great ending, and it kept getting better and better. It also has saddness, too. But more happiness. I will say it again, The Shawshank Redemption was the best movie, is the best movie, and always will be the best movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!	10
 Best all around film	The first time I watched this movie, I thought to myself this could easily be one of my all time favorites.  The second time I watched it I knew it was my all time favorite.  This movie is about building relationships and getting a second chance.  The acting is superb and gave me a whole new outlook on Morgan Freeman as an actor.  His naration of the movie is excellent.	10
 there's a reason for being one of the tops...	Great characters.  Beautifully filmed.  Moving...sad, yet beautiful and top shelf story telling.  There has to be enough accolades to warrant viewing this here so I won't blather on about what a great flick this was except to say it was.  Watch it and if you don't agree on it's placement...you must be...unbelievable.	10
 THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN	This is my favorite movie of all time. But it is only for certain kinds of movie watchers. For people who only want to see action and certain female upper body parts this film is not for you. Ask any real movie watcher, they will all say that this is a great movie.	10
 One Great Movie	"To say that ""The Shawshnak Redemption"" is a truly great film doesn't do it justice. Having read a lot of the comments already on here about this film, there really isn't much more I could add to it. *SPOILERS* However there are two things that might not have been said about his film. Regardless of how much I love this film and rank it very high. I have one problem with it & that is that it is too long. Mainly I say this because there are parts where this film could have ended and I would have been just as satisfied. My personal point for this film to end would have probably been when we see Andy Dufrense driving on the highway beside the Pacific. Either that or when Red narrates about how he hopes he can make it across the boarder and how he hopes to see his friend. The other comment I have about this film is that they tell you what is going to happen...in a way. The scene in which we hear of Andy's desire to ""get busy living or get busy dying"" The scene in which he wants to go to Mexico & open a hotel on the beach and fix up a boat & take his guests charter fishing. In that scene Red listens to Andy & then tells him ""You shouldn't do this to yourself. This is just Sh!*ty pipe dreams."" Hearing that after having seen the movie as many times as I have I thought it was amusing for that to be said. Still I would rank Shawshank in my Top Ten easily. Far and away the best movie of 1994 and was snubbed for Best Picture. Not to mention Morgan Freeman. But almost as bad was the fact that neither Tim Robbins nor Frank Darabont were even nominated. 9 1/2 out of 10"	
 Sentimental yet strongly moving story of injustice, optimism, retribution		
 THE GREATEST..!	to me this is the greatest movie of all time...!IT has every thing a movie watcher could ask for.it's not too long it's not too short,it keeps you guessing,and the ending you wouldn't have guessed in a 1000 years.morgan freeman and tim robbins are absolutely wicked,MORGAN FREEMAN is one of best actors in the movies today...!	10
 Perfection!	This is my favorite movie of all time and I have viewed it many times.  It is the only movie that produced quotes which I use in my life.  This movie flows from beginning to end, the characters are perfectly cast, and the story line is impeccable.  Can you imagine anyone other than Morgan Freeman doing the narration for this movie?  Anyone else as Andy Dufresne?  Get busy living or get busy dying..Damm Right!  This movie has one of the best final scenes ever filmed.	10
 This film is just so damn good	I have never ever felt the feelings i felt watching the masterpiece of a movie, its really manages to play hard on the watchers emotions, I think I was feeling happy , then sad then angry and in the end a sense of justice...This film is probably the best film I have ever seen/felt it does the job 10-10	10
 Best movie of the '90s	This is easily the best movie of the '90s.  Or maybe one of the best movies of the '90s.  Stephen King's sure does show us that he can make awesome books besides horrors.  He also made The Green Mile.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are excellent in this excellent movie.  they both should've won Academy Awards for this one.  Definitely.  I love this movie.  I must have saw this movie about 20 times.  It is as great as the critics say it is. The direction for this is amazing.Overall the whole movie is great and I am surprised that Stephen King made such a good novel.  I've made my mind for the best movie of the '90s. Rating 11 out of 10. (Best Movie of the '90s)	10
 one of the best movies ever	i dont know what to see about this movie that hasn't already been said. as good as movie as forrest gump was, the only major award it should have won over shawshank was tom hanks as best actor. an argument can be made for zemeckis for director, but seeing as shawshank redemption is such a better movie, and most of the movie takes place in location, (shawshank prison) i think darabont is robbed not only for not winning the oscar, but not even scoring a nomination. and seeing as he would be the best director, i would think that if you're directed your film best it would logically be the best picture. tim robbins is also robbed of a nomination, and i think hanks just edges him for that trophy. the biggest travesty of all is that shawshank doesn't even win any of the oscars it was nominated for. if you havent seen this film recently, go pop it in the dvd or vcr and just sit back and revel in its magnificence.	10
 Forget the IMDB Top 250 ranking- this is still a great movie.		10
 One of the FINEST movies ever made...	Simply one of the FINEST movies ever produced by Hollywood. Great in all aspects - acting, story line, cinematography and dialogue!Dont miss this in your life time!I rate it 4 over 5	8
 Masterpiece	This movie is quite simply one of the greatest of all time.  I have never felt for characters in a movie like I have in this one.  It would have won the Academy Award for best picture if it weren't for Forrest Gump.  I love that movie too, however, I think Shawshank is a more enduring movie.  It's tale is more about the human spirit, and overcoming probably one of the most difficult situations anyone could ever face.	10
 Bravo! Suspect-8	I absolutely LOVE this movie, and I've seen it many times over, but I've never thought of it in biblical terms before.  I'm also not very religious so the Christ parallel did not occur to me.  Now that you mention it, it's almost too obvious.	10
 Alongside with Braveheart and Shindler's List one of the best movies of the '90s.	Fantastic film that dramatically and powerfully displays the strength of the human will. With unforgettable performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. Subtle use of color (moreso lack thereof) helps to generate moods and feelings that resonate with the gripping plot and near-perfect dialog. A must see.	10
 A film that expands (and sometimes alters) your take on the world.		10
 Best movie ever made	This is the best movie of all time!!!  It has all you need and more. Amazing performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.  This movie is a CLASSIC and will stand the test of time.  The story has everything but it clearly presents the true ideas of friendship and relationships between people, especially under the worst situations.  Anyone who hasnt seen this movie- DONT WALK_ RUN- to see it!  It will stick with you forever	10
 A modern masterpiece, simple yet supreme.		
 Classic, better than Citizen Kane.	This would have to be one, if not the greatest movie i have ever seen. Why Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabond did'nt win a thing from the work they put into it is so beyond me, this has the perfect quality of what Oscar Winning movies are made of. Compared with many other heart wrenching films made to date this movie is Good, Better, Best.	
 Everyone in the fam loves it!	One of the best movies I've seen, and one of only a few I am willing to watch more than once. The kids have even watched it more than me. The pacing is slow but constant and the tone it sets pulls you in from the start.	10
 One of the Greatest Movies in the history of cinema	This film is destined to become a true classic. This masterpiece of filmmaking is worthy of its place on the Top 250 and should be #1. The film gives time to its characters and time to the story unlike other films. We see the world through the characters and feel as they do. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give outstanding performances well worthy of an Academy Award. The ending is the greatest of any film and is so because of the time given to the characters and story. The score captivates the feeling of the film and gives the feel of Andy and Red's true redemption. This is a must have in any collection and deserves all the allure it has been given.	10
 A tale of hope	"Hope. It´s obviously ""the"" word that defines this movie. In fact, there´s five reasons that makes this film almost perfect.1) An incredible fidelity to the original story by Stephen King 2) Great performances by both actors, Freeman and Robins. 3) A simply perfect ambientation 4) When you see it, you feel deep in your heart a new reason to live, no matter what 5) There´s nothing ""out of place"".As Red, I hope this movie never dies. I hope that someday someone understands that is five million times better film than ""Forrest Gump"", his competitor on Oscar´s. I hope that Frank Darabont makes another film such as this. I hope you read this. I hope."	
 Best Story leads to best Movie		10
 why life in truly beautiful		
 The Shawshank Redemption, the movie of perfection	***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When I saw the movie for the first time I was a child of 8 years old I guess. I was completely obsessed by this movie. The movie took too much time so my parents didn't allow me to see the end of the movie. I was mad as you can understand ;) Now Im a boy of 16 years old and I saw the movie 8 times. Im a bit of a movie freak, if I have the time for it I watch one every evening. I have seen a lot of movies. But not such good as The Shawshank Redemption. This movie is a perfection. It has a perfect story. The movie is very long, but I have never bored while I was watching. The sound and music are also perfect. When Brooks leaves the prison and sees the daylife again the music is totally perfect. You are going to think about some things you have done in your life. That's the same when Andy escapes and arranges the beers for his friends. Red says about Andy when you him sitting in the sun (when he has arranged the beers) with a little smile on his face: 'I think he did it to feel normal again'. That are lines when you start thinking. And when Red is allowed to leave prison you got a kind of a winner feeling. Then he sees Andy again, that's the perfect end. This movie was not a simple prison breakout. But a movie with the best story I have ever seen. I can say to everyone that you have to see the movie. Im sure you will think the same way as I do. When you see it multiple times you will understand the movie better and better, and I hope you will love then as much as I do!	10
 stephan king and frank darabont put together a masterpiece	when stephan king asked frank darabont to go behind the prison walls once again, it was a second match made in heaven (the green mile).  these are two of stephan king's best novel's brought to screen with darabont's master script writing.  why are they the best?  because they are actually believable and extraordinary tales which don't involve fantasy, magic or gothic horror.	10
 The No1 film ever.	This is the one and only film that even though it is over two hours, I wanted to watch it again, the second it finished. No other film has ever bought up such emotions from me. I will stand by this as The Greatest Film of all time proudly.	10
 Odd that this movie is so high on the IMDB top-250....		
 Bad Title, Truly Great Film	"When I first watched ""The Shawshank Redeption"", I thought it was a O-K movie. Something in the characters and the motion picture score would draw me back to see the movie again. Now, it is one of my all-time favorite movies. It is a classic. The story, adapted from a Steven King novel, stays true to the book. To me, there is something intriguing about a person changing his destiny, especially against all hope. The casting of the key players in the movie are right on target, and Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work very well together. So, when you get a great script, talented actors cast properly, and a movie score that captures the mood and drama of the scene, it makes for a memorable movie."	10
 Fantastic!	What else is there to say about this movie?  Every single element is great from the direction all the way down to the score, which accents every moment fantastically.  And then there's the acting, which I cannot praise enough for everyone's excellent portrayal.  There is not a single moment in the movie which I felt an element to be untrue to how the characters would actually be all the way to the extras which is an extremely rare achievement.  But the thing that makes this so great is that for some reason it never seems to get old no matter how much I watch it, in fact, it even gets better and better because I realize how much of a gem this really is. If you are one of the few not to have viewed this, please do yourself a favor and watch one of the most incredible movies of our time.	10
 Simply a great movie	Never have i seen a movie so well directed the script was genius....one of the best movies ive ever seen.....10/10 eaisly!!!  Morgan freeman and tim robbins made this movie work....if forest gump came out a year later this movie would have swept the oscars.	10
 No Best Picture Oscar - Absolutely Criminal	This film is without a doubt, one of the all time classics. It has everything - drama, comedy, suspense. Watching this film leaves you with a good feeling - it makes you realise that true friendship is hard to find but something to really cherish.  The story of Andy & Red (The 2 main characters), and how they go about living in the prison is moving, gritty and very realistic. I recommend this film to everyone, young and old, it will appeal to everyone.  Its a brilliant film capped by a brilliant ending. 10/10	10
 An idea for an improvement	You know what would have made this movie a whole lot better? It's if at the end, when Red (Morgan Freeman) made his final long,windy speech to the parole board, he had been rejected onceagain, and the movie ended right there?  Maybe then I'd considerthe average rating (9.0) and rank (#2) on the IMDb top 250 list to bewell deserved.	6
 Absolutely the best!!	"This movie is absolutely the best movie I've ever seen. I can't help but sit down through this whole movie and not get up once even though I've seen it over and over again. Every part of the movie I'm saying to myself ""I can't get up now, this is my favorite part"". Although, my two favorite parts are the beer scene and the end of the movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, go out and buy it. Don't rent it, you won't take it back!"	10
 Flawless Perfection		10
 Classic!	Having seen such a movie again and again, you subconsciencly begin to look for flaws or errors that will somehow lift it off its pedestal, just so you can put your already tiresome mind at ease and not give it another thought. But with this movie, im still looking, so i'm beginning to got used to the fact that this movie will, and more than likely, always be jumping to the top of my mind whenever i try and define 'what a movie CAN be'.It's already a classic....	10
 One of my favourites	Frank Darabont's film based on Steven King's story is absolutely inspirational. Great performances all round and it keeps the viewer attached throughout. The Shawshank Redemption is quite long, yet you don't notice it, instead you notice the genius that has gone into this film's creation. See this film, no matter what your movie preference.	10
 The BEST Movie Ever!	Simply - the best movie of all times.  Great performances from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  Delivers all emotions through a great story - laughter, sadness, joy, anger.  Really shows the range of Stephen King.  See it once and you'll want to see it again and again.	10
 Amazingly Human!	"There is nothing that i can say that has not already been said in a very positive way about this movie.I simply loved it.I do wish however that a ""Special Edition"" DVD of Shawshank would be released that would include the 1 hour TV feature of all the actors making comments on it.The current dvd does not have enough included for a great movie of its stature. This movie will certainly become a classic.Watching this movie actually makes me feel proud to be human.It re-affirms my belief in mankind.Now if only every president,prime minister and leader would watch it and get the same feeling from it as i did......geez....maybe they would WAKE UP and realize that ""Life Is To Short""....Get Busy Living or Get Busy Dying!!"	10
 An honour to watch	There a few films that I have ever felt honoured to watch, and the Shawshank Redemption is one of them. Freeman and Robbins give career-defining performances. Really, I can only say - go out and rent it now. This is a truly inspirational film	
 Truly deserves its high rating.		10
 GREAT FILM!!!	Since everyone has already covered the bases, and don't feel like retyping all the same acclaims, I will simply say this touching, powerful film is single handedly one of the GREATEST FILMS EVER of the 20th Century!!!  If you haven't already seen it for the wonderful acting, wonderful plot or wonderful directing, see it for Morgan Freeman's stupendous performance alongside some other class actors!  This is one of his best works, which says a lot :o)	10
 Transcends its source in leaps and bounds		10
 This is my favorite movie of all time.	"Many people seem confused why this movie is rated so high by so many.  I am confused how you can walk away from this movie and not think that is one of the greatest movies you have seen.  I am more baffled some people gave it a ""1"" rating.  To each his own I suppose.  For those who don't understand what makes this movie so great I will explain.*SPOILERS* Probably the number one thing about this movie is the acting.  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins play the most believable and likeable characters ever.  The movie is like a good hit of ecstacy.  It builds up for so long that you really come to like Andy and hate the warden.  Then before the end he escapes, the warden throws the rock through the wall, the warden kills himself, and finally they are on a beach in Mexico.  All the special effects on earth couldn't give me a rush like the end of this movie.  It just creates this moving emotional feeling inside and you feel as vindicated as you know Andy and Red must feel.Of course there are many other great moments in the middle of the movie. For example, when they get to drink the beer and when the guy passes the test.  I could go on for hours about this movie so I'll stop now."	10
 fantastic	Like few movies do, the shawshank redemption capture that feel and atmosphere of a good movie. I find myself watching this movie over and over. It does a good job of wowing you whilst shocking you. Do yourself a huge favor and watch this movie!	10
 Made me cry	This film is the best one-off ever made. From watching the Green Mile and from what I heard about the Majestic, it seems that Frank Darabont will never make a movie as good as this again. It is emotional, ambitious, and breathtaking in equal measure. The last 30 minutes are the best on celluloid.	10
 What Genre Is This Film?		
 Overrated on IMDb		
 Underrated		10
 Quite simply the best film ever made.	'The Shawshank Redemption' is quite simply the best film ever to be produced. in no way, shape or form could it be improved in any way. there is absolutely nothing to fault about it. it is brilliantly written and the acting is second to none, Morgan Freeman is currently the second best actor in the world. The whole story is masterfully told with a severe twist in the tale that will leave even the most heartless of people feeling happy. Anyone who has not seen this film, must see it. for me, it deserves the accolade, 'A Spanking Piece Of Cinematography'.I love the shawshank redemtion and anyone involved with it.	10
 Well Deserved 3rd in top 250 films	On reading the comments of others left on the page i was surprised. I would rate this as worthy of being 3rd in the top 250. The film may not be an action packed ride from start to finish as you may expect a jail break to be, but this is because it is not what the film is meant to be about. If you have read Kings original short story you will see that the adaptation of this film does it justice, as so many attempts of making films from his books have not, with the exception of stanly kubrick's adaptation of the shining. The acting by tim robbins and morgan freeman only adds to the prominence of this film in expressing the adversity that was suffered by prisoners back in the 40's.	10
 Not perfect but still I recommend it very much because it´s a great film!	This film should not be(as many else films)in top 3 of the 250 best films ever made.First I want to say something about the acting, that is one of the things that makes this one so good.Morgan Freeman is fantastic and so is Tim Robbins(both of them are very good actors even if Freeman is better).The script is also fantastic and the whole complex of the film is brilliant.It´s a film that might will bring you to tears, even if it in the end goes to far and everything becomes silly.I mean it could they could have cut out the last fifteen minutes but it´s still a frightening film.The message in the film are that you will survive as long as you have hope.4,5/5	9
 Truly Amazing	If you were to look at a plot synopsis for this movie, there is little chance that you would be interested in it. However having watched it on recommendation from a friend, I was staggered at how good this movie is. I don't know what it was, but something grabbed hold of me and made me appreciate this movie. Tim Robbins is excellent as Andy Dufresne and he never won an Academy Award is beyond me.After all the cliched buddy-buddy movies made in the 80's, it's nice to be able to sit down and watch a tale of genuine and lasting friendship.	10
 The best movie ever made.	If you haven't seen it yet, this picture will reaffirm hope in life, humanity and the movies.  Morgan Freeman proves himself as one of the best actors of our time.  Tim Robbins has a humble, underplayed style that fits well in the picture.  Probably one of the best scripts ever written.	10
 Excellent movie, but very FAMILIAR....?		
 Great movie	"This is one of the best movies I have come across. The acting of Tim Robbins is excellent but it is Morgan Freeman as Red who steals the show with a breathtaking performance. The story continually kept me interested and Tim Robbins' struggle against nearly every inmate in shawshank. Its possibly only his great friendship with Red that keeps him sane.It was also strange to see one of the sisters in the movie who continually try to rape Tim Robbins, played marine hard man Drake in ""Aliens"", which is also one of my all time favourites.Great movie. Rating 9/10."	9
 One of the best pictures ever made	This is one of the best pictures ever made. The acting, directing, screenplay...are so wonderful! But, for the Academy, the best picture of 1994 was...Forrest Gump (!!!!!!!!!!!!). This movie must have win the oscar for Best Picture, Director, Adapted screenplay and direction of photography (at least). You will never forget this movie. Go to see it, now!	10
 The film that started my love for dramas	***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I was twelve when I first saw this movie in 1998. I was flipping through the channels on my TV when I was first introduced to the character of Andy Dufresne. I watched with amazement and was fully absorbed by the happenings and events that took place. When a commercial break came on, I was impatient for it to end so I could find out what would be next. The beginning of the movie has Andy being imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. He says he didn't do it. And I believed he did, until the plot twister changed my whole perspective. Red is the man narrorating, and to me, is the main character about how is life is changed around over the twenty years he knows Andy. And if it's anything that made me cry, it was at the end where Red is finally free. This film started my compassion for movies with meaning behind them, and if you view this picture, be ready for a new look on life.In other words, DON'T pass this movie by. Enjoy!	
 Pure beauty captured on film.		10
 One of the greatest film ever!	Great movie, I have seen this movie almost 100 times, and i guess i can see it another 1000 times more.it leaves a such a great effect on me, which is hard to explain in words. Just Love it!:)	10
 A Perfect Gem of a Film		10
 hope and will-power	This is an excellent movie. I usually get depressed watching prison movies. Even though the pace of the movie was slow, it is so well made that it keeps your interest alive all the time. The narrative style also added to the relaxed pace. I am sure anybody who watched the movie would come out feeling good about life. The message is pretty clear - even though the obstacles in life seem to be daunting and often impossible to overcome, with hope, will-power and dedication, everything is achievable. Tim Robinson and Morgan Freeman were simply great and played their roles to perfection. I also liked the concept of institutionalization - after a while some people would rather want to be in prison than be faced with a whole new world which has changed so much from what they were used to.	10
 Is this the greatest movie ever made?	It is certainly the best prison movie. It's definitely the best outing for Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. It's certainly the best movie of the 90's.If you haven't seen it - buy it for your collection today!	10
 No other movie portraits the triumph of the human spirit like The Shawshank Redemption Does	This is probably the best movie of all times! It is certainly my favorite movie ever. Tim Robbins does an outstanding job here! I don't think there is another movie that captures the triupmh of the human spirit. It is certainly inspirational. Andy Dufresne is the perfect example of perseverence and faith. Excellent movie!	10
 Fantastic:-)	Great movie, great actors.Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman really blows your mind in this motion picture.Andy & Reds partnership is well worth while. Andy is - as promised, full of surprises and saves his best for last.	10
 To those of you who think this movie is overrated...	I've heard alot of people say this movie is overrated, but none of them seem to remember to give a comparison.  If this movie is undeserving of its status as one of the best movies ever, then what movie is better?  I'd really like someone to supply an alternative so I could rip their choice apart and show them exactly why it's not as good.	10
 Work of Art	Has to undoubtedly be one of the best movies of all time.  Casting, acting, plot, cinematography, musical score.  Everyone should see this movie to know what a good movie is.  The plot twist at the very end was in itself a work of art.  10/10.	10
 brilliant!!!!	"**** SPOILERS HEREIN**** proceed at own risk!!!!!it is simply no wonder that shawshank redemption is as insanely popular as it is. the movie is the greatest flag-bearer for hope and the determination. i have been wanting to see this movie for a long time and recently caught it on television as part of a stephen king horror special series!!!!the movie begins at quite a slow pace and after about half an hour i was wondering why this movie was so highly rated. but slowly the movie unravels and soon i was totally caught up in its brilliance. sometimes harsh, sometimes serene, sometimes wishful, sometimes dreadful. the intensity of the despondence at shawshank prison is almost tangible.tim robbins and morgan freeman are outstanding in their roles. each character is brilliantly etched and is a delight to watch. the screenplay is the highlight of the movie and there is always a feeling of something larger lurking behind the damp grey walls of shawshank.for those who have seen the movie, an interesting point would be that the name of stephen king's novella is ""rita hayworth & the shawshank redemption"". well well!!the movie though has to be watched. it is an experience every human should go through. it takes the light at the end of the tunnel to the next plane.an elevating 10!!"	10
 All time classic	A film is only as good as the after effect that it leaves on you. Shawshank leaves you with a warm glow of fulfilness, which in my opinion is matched only by The Usual Suspects. Tim Robbins, gives a once in a life time performance, as the silver spoon banker wrongly thrown into prison.The plot is second to none... which is one of the reasons this film is loved by so many. The simple but involving story grabs you, so as you feel almost at one with the prisoners, only to then reveal the clever twist at the end. At which you realise how you never were a part, but only a pawn in this masterpiece.	10
 Perhaps the best prison story ever	"Tim Robbins gives the performance of a lifetime as Andy, a man wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover.  He is an unconventional prisoner who forms a friendship with Red, played brilliantly by one of the greatest actors of his generation, Morgan Freeman.To give away any more of the story is a crime, because this is an incredible movie that needs to be seen by everyone.  I give ""The Shawshank Redemption"" a 10 out of 10."	8
 The Best Story Ever Told	If you didn't like The Shawshank Redemption, then you don't understand the concept of the film.  Shawshank is the epitome of good film-making -- a fresh, interesting, verisimilar, detailed story coupled with acting that makes Tim Robbins stand out in my mind as Andy Dufresne himself.  The imagery is beautiful, the story has few, if any, holes, and Morgan Freeman plays the character of Red, the film's narrator, exceedingly well.  To those who find it unnatural that a murderer has matured into a wise, thoughtful man during a long tenure in prison, I suggest that there is no more logical place for such a transformation.  Red has had 20 years (upon Andy's arrival) to think about the crimes of his youth, and has grown as a  result.   In short, Shawshank is a movie for people who like good stories.  It will make you laugh, it might make you cry, and in the end, you'll simply feel good about life itself.	
 Extremely engrossing, painstakingly perfect...	I had been meaning to watch this movie for a long time, but I got the chance only yesterday, when I watched it on HBO. I can only say that for eight years I had missed a chance to witness a brilliant work. Tim Robbins is really good, so is Morgan Freeman. But the movie is not about any central character. The movie as a whole is devastatingly perfect. I saw Forrest Gump and thought it was awesome, deserving of the Oscar. But eight years since, I have to change my mind...	
 Amazing, Original, Inspirationally brilliant...		10
 One of the finest movies of all time.		10
 The best movie I have ever seen.	I just can't find a single flaw with this movie.  It's so perfect.  The acting is fantastic, the character development is superb, the plot and script is incredible.  I bought the DVD and never get tired of watching it.  This movie truly belongs among the greats, such as The Godfather, Citizen Kane, and Schindler's List, and this is the only movie I would place above the others in this elite group. There is no single element that makes it such a fantastic movie; the combination of every aspect of the movie being executed perfectly makes it great.  A true masterpiece.	10
 Stunning		10
 A movie worth watching again.	Tim Robbins plays innocence man send to jail for his wife's murder. Morgan Freeman plays his closes friend in jail and forming an unlikely pair of buddies. They never give up the dreams of escape outside of prison. There are certain points you miss the first time watching the Shawshank Redemption. This movie does more that entertain, it make you think how something is planned.	
 This is a truly great movie. See it!	No long summary here.   It's about two guys in prison, that probably don't belong there, that have lots of time to reflect on life.  You will like them.  The characters are deep.  They will remind you of real people.  You will feel richer as a person after seeing this movie.  It's inspirational, philosophical, yet doesn't preach.  Beautifully filmed, acted, and directed. It doesn't get much better than this.	10
 Wow.	This movie is the best drama I have ever seen. The acting was powerful. The plot was powerful. The mood was powerful. It must just be luck or if not, extreme skill to make a movie so good as this. Every actor in this movie takes life as serious as he really would in life, from the evil warden to Red to Andy--they all make it worth while. This is probably one of the few good prison movies out there (Green Mile was excellent too), but it is soooo great! The ending makes it all worth while also, being the best part of the movie (I'm not going to say any spoilers, but just let me say that you'll find out a lot more than you expected). I can't imagine how much pain you would have to go through to be wrongfully imprisoned for so many years. If you are sensitive about subjects like this, don't see the movie. But if you love drama at any level, I HIGHLY recommend this movie to you. It definitely deserves its high rank in the top 250. Go ahead and see it--you won't be disappointed. 10/10.	
 Suffering leads to redemption.	In life we are all challenged with gross injustices.  To some it may be being passed over for a promotion, or to others it may be something as trivial as being served the wrong plate at a restaurant.  How we deal with those injustices shape our lives or end our lives.  In Shawshank we see how one man is dealt with one of the largest injustices known to man, and accepts the injustice.  He never asks for sympathy, for he believes in a way he deserves his fate.  However, when the new world that he enters deals him a new hand of unfairness, our man once again accepts the misdeeds that are dealt him.  The irony of the story is the only illegal thing that our man Andy does is what sets him free and redeems his life.	10
 Good, but not great.	Haven't seen this for a couple years, guess I should give it a try again. It was enjoyable and clever at turns, but a little formulaic.  I was also very bothered by the lack of racism portrayed in the film.  Racism is a very bad thing, but it was also so very pervasive in the 1930's that portraying it as basically nonexistent is tantamount to historical revisionism.  That left a bad taste in my mouth.	8
 superbly written and acted, worth seeing and seeing again	"Probably the best Stephen King film adaption ever, but you don't have to be a King fan to enjoy this awesome movie. The plot centers around the (wrongful?) incarceration of Maine banker Andy Dufresne(excellently portrayed by Tim Robbins) after being convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover. However, the film (AND story....read it) go beyond that and detail the cruel, corrupt inner workings of the prison, the emotional and mental state of the inmate, and the conflict of inner bars versus outer ones. The supporting cast is also uncommonly good, led by heavyweight character-actor Morgan Freeman as the veteran con ""get-it-guy"" Red. With moments of brutality, beauty, humor, and an unexpected twist, The Shawshank Redemption is easily one of the best films in recent cinematic history."	10
 An amazing, classic prison film	Shawshank Redemption is a great film. This is one of the best dramas ever made, and probably Morgan Freeman's best film.  One of the reasons why it was so good is the voice-over in the film. Morgan Freeman has a superb reading voice and works well as a narrator. I think the best scene is when Andy plays the opera music and all the prisoners look up to the speakers as if it is a God or idol.  It shows a glimpse of freedom in the eyes of the prisoners. Also the story-line was excellent, but I dont think that it was explained clear enough what happened in the beginning. But it still is one of the best films made.	9
 wow	"""hope is a good thing. maybe the best of things. and no good thing ever dies.""with a line like that, how can it not be good? King is a genius of writing. Darabont is a genius of directing. dream team."	10
 a drama done perfect	Movies are all made for a purpose, most of those purposes are to make money - heck if they dont make money they cant make a movie, but some movies go beyond just trying to make a buck and really stand out as one of the best in their genres.This is one of those movies.	10
 Intriguing story	This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The story is exciting, intriguing, and believable.  That acting is some of the best I have ever seen and you really feel involved with characters.  It really makes you think and is highly entertaining.  Morgan Freeman is one of my favorite actors and his performance is once again mesmerizing.  Its one of those movies you don't mind seeing over and over again.  I loved it.	10
 great!	I realize it every time I see this movie... This is the best movie I have ever seen! It's just great! I mean, the story is strong and so are the actors. The music fits perfectly in the movie and it's one of the most clever movies I've seen. After seeing this movie for the first time in '96 I thought WOW! I went to rent it and watched it again. It got my attention that it was based on a novel. So I ordered the novel. It's my favorite book now. I must have read it more then ten times. After that I saw the other stories were filmed too. So I went to rent them too. They are very good too, but The Shawshank Redemption is the best. 5 Years later I'm one of Stephen King's and Tim Robbins' biggest fans in the world. Everybody who hasn't seen it yet: take my advise and watch it. You'll share my opinion: it's the best movie you'll ever see. Now it's finally available on DVD in Holland too, so I can watch it with hopefully lots of extras...	10
 UNBELIEVABLE!!!!	This movie was an apparent outcast at the theaters because I never even remember ever hearing about it.  However, thanks to TNT and TBS this movie has become my favorite movie of all time!! It's moving and entertaining. It captures your attention and is intriguing enough to keep you focused. WOW, what an awe-inspiring masterpiece!	10
 THE Movie	This is the greatest movie of all time.  It is based on a Stephen King novella.  He is the best author there is.  This movie stars Morgan Freeman. One of the best actors there is.  This is a highly emotional masterpiece. It draws you and and does not let go until it wants to.  A great date movie. A great anything movie.  See it.	10
 Redemption is the word	And what a way to say it! Until this one, I have never before rated a movie 10. It is by all accounts the best movie I have ever seen. Frankly I felt a little bit bored by the story but suddenly it was as if the story had taken a turn and everything fell into place. The first two thirds of the movie started making perfect sense. Then it takes another turn, perfectly underlined by Morgan Freeman's marvellously confused expression being questioned by the warden. From this part on the movie is a bit more ordinary but still a beautiful drama.The Marriage of Figaro has gotten new meaning.	10
 Very Good Movie		
 Beyond words	"Wow, this film was really something! I'm glad I started to watch all the top films of imdb.com's ""All time Top 250 Movies"" list. Sure, The Godfather triology and Seven Samurai were great movies too, but they were way too long and I felt they rather gave me pain in the buttocks than a touch in my mind. This movie, on the other hand, has this distinguished feature; you don't want it to end. I haven't felt that way since I watched the Matrix at the cinema back in its old glory days (that goes for both the movie The Matrix and cinemas, they're out of date nowadays :)). It also made very clear to me that I never want to go to an american prison, just as little as I would like to go to a turkish prison..."	10
 Absolutely perfect, in every way.	This is one of those rare films that actually exceeds the book by which it was based upon.  It's that good.  Not only is this a damn good  flick, it actually made me a fan of Tim Robbins and told me what I already knew about Morgan Freeman; He's one of the best actors alive.  I really can't say much more.  This is one of my favorite movies ever and there is no way that I can make that point any clearer.  If, for some reason, you haven't already seen this, go get it now!!!  If you don't, you're seriously depraved.  What a movie!!!!	
 Fantastic.	"I read a review once that said ""If you are not even feeling slightly uplifted by the end of this movie, you are made of stone."" I couldn't have said it better. Some scenes may not sit well with the easily disturbed, but there you are.Go see it. 9/10."	9
 Faithful adaptation of the book!!	"Unfortunately I did not get to see this film in the theaters.  When this film was released in 1994 I had grown tired of the ""prison"" movie.  I had already seen TANGO & CASH (T&C) and LOCK UP (LU) both of these films starred Sylvester Stallone.  I had also seen Death Warrant (DW) with Jean Claude Van Damme and figured that this would just be another run of them mill movie about a guy wrongfully imprisoned.  Eventually I rented this film and boy was I wrong!  Unlike the earlier mentioned films this was not an action flick but an emotional story about the hardships of prison life and the struggle an inmate encounters trying to maintain hope of eventually leaving the prison.  I so enjoyed this movie that I obtained the original novel and found that while there are some changes to the story they are relatively minor and do not detract from the theme of the story.  In my review I will compare the book to the film.  Spoilers may be present in the review.1.  In the book Andy Dufresne is in jail until 1975.  In the movie he is only in jail until 1967.2.  In the book Andy's poster at the time of his departure is one of Linda Ronstadt.  In the movie it is Raquel Welch.3.  In the book Andy served time under several wardens and head guards.  In the movie Warden Norton was in office for Andy's entire prison stay as was the head guard Byron Hadley.  Actually in the book Byron Hadley was the head guard when Andy arrived in Shawshank and had retired by the time Norton became warden.  4.  In the book Red is describe as Irish and although no reference is made to his race I assumed he was white.  In the movie Red is black being portrayed by Morgan Freeman, and the character Red indicates that he is Irish.  While this does not contradict the book I think by making Red an African American it differed from most readers conception of Red.  However, Morgan Freeman did such a fine job in the role of Red it is impossible for me to think of anyone else in that role.5.  In the book Andy, with help from a friend in the outside world, invests all his money prior to his arrest under a false identity so that when he leaves Shawshank he has money to start over with.  In the movie Andy departs with Warden Norton's ill gotten gains to start his new life.6.  In the book no warden commits suicide and no prisoner is killed after the warden stages a fake escape attempt.  Both these acts occur in the move.There are other small differences between the movie and the book but none that alter the overall story.  I would suggest to all that this story is worth reading and watching.  There is a reason that it is ranked so high in IMDB's ranking chart.  Just a bit of trivia for Stephen King fans.  The character of Andy Dufresne also has a key cameo role in Stephen King's book APT PUPIL.  It is Andy Dufresne that unknowingly helps escaped Nazi henchman Kurt Dussander set up a life in America.  This occurs while Andy is working at the Maine bank prior to going to Shawshank."	
 Excellent!	I've been hearing a lot of positivt things about this movie for a long time, and finally I had the opportunity to watch it myself.My expectations were high, but to be honest I didn't expect it to be this good! This film is just excellent, and I warmly recommend it to everyone!	10
 a breathtaking masterpiece	as with many others i first saw this film on video and after watching it i was stunned by what is a very simple story told in such a way that at the end of the film i knew i had watched a cinematic masterpiece. the performances of robbins and freeman are excellent but i believe all the cast make this film what it is. a modern classic	10
 One of the best movies ever made	This movie is excellent. That is the best word to describe this movie. Tim Robbins was in top form as Andy who claims innocence to the criminal charge of murder and Morgan Freeman was very believable as Andy's friend, Red. I found this film to be very real yet at the same time it had a layer of magic to it. The characters were all very interesting to watch, some warm and brotherly, others frightening and souless. Even though I am female, I felt a kinship to Andy and found myself in his corner routing for him the whole time. He did not fail those of us that were watching. A definate in my personal top ten.	
 The best film ever!!!!!	this is the best film that I have seen it is breathtaking the plot is excelent and the ending is magnificent	10
 A flawless movie		10
 The Triumph of the Human Spirit	"CONTAINS SPOILERS ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film about banker Andy Dufrense(Tim Robbins) who is framed and sent to a maximum security prison for the murder of his wife and her lover.He befriends Red Redding(Morgan Freeman), who is the only guilty man in Shawshank, the prison.  Through a few brutal years, Andy finally manages to get through.  He helps prisoners graduate high school, opens a prison library, and works on the taxes for the crooked warden(Bob Gunton). Little does anybody know what his secret is, an escape.Based on a short story by Stephen King from 'Different Seasons', this is the best film about the triumph of the human spirit.  Frank Daranbot delivers a top notch drama.  This film also features an excellent musical score by Thomas Newman.  Morgan Freeman delivers,in my opinion, his best role.  Though a little cruel at some points, this film will make you want to see it again.  One of the three best films of the 1990s.  Second on my all time list."	10
 This wasn't supposed to be comedy... oh, well	"Like ""Pearl Harbor,"" (AAAHHH!) this film had comedy despite the fact that it was a drama. For example, when Andy is ordered to turn off music that is annoying to the Warden (but not to the rest of the prison... they just listen), Andy turns it up!But, unlike ""Pearl Harbor"" (AAAHHH!), this film actually needed a bit of GOOD laughter, whereas ""PH"" (AAAHHH!) was laughable in itself, with unneccesary BAD comedy.Anyway, I read the novella first and let me tell you, the film (edited-I watched on TNT) has many differences and add-ons. For example, that bit of comedy wasn't in the book (heck, NO comedy was in the book). Also, (spoiler) when Andy has disappeared, the Warden didn't throw his hand-carved chess pieces at the poster-he tore it down. Also, the novella wasn't 100 pages, whereas this movie (on TNT, with commercials and edits) was 3 hours whole!I am STILL deciding on where to put this better-than-most-films-these-days movie on Favorites list. I am tempted to put it near the top (not at the top-there are better films), but somewhere online someone said that it was a middle-movie (an okay one). Another person declined, but after watching again, they agreed. So, I'll put it somewhere in the middle.I liked it very much, but it's not my favorite movie ever, nor the second. Rather... ah, heck, I can't decide right now!Rating: 4.5/6"	9
 Frank Darabont's Debut Masterpiece	This I have to say was one of my favorite movies of all time. I didn't see it until 1998 though. I had heard about it, but never actually had seen it. But when I did, I went out and bought it on video. I've always liked Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins has become a favorite of mine too. For some reason I like prison movies. It's just the suspense that really gets me. Movies like Escape From Alcatraz, The Green Mile, Instinct, and The Last Castle are among my favorites. To anyone who has not yet seen this movie, go rent it tonight, you will not be disappointed!	10
 One of the best ever	"I have a rather small film collection, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the movies that is a part of it.  This film is done beautifully, from the soundtrack to the acting.  I'm no film critic, so I'll leave the in-depth reviews to those who are more capable, but I will say that if you haven't seen this film, make the trip to the video store.I give it a 10."	10
 A Triumph of Human Spirit	"I have never been impressed so much by any movie like I have been by "" the shawshank redemption "" This movie flows like a river. The further you get in the story the more it captures you emotionally and before you know it you are one with it. The story is about triumph of human spirit. Amazing..........WOW.I proudly own a DVD copy of this movie and sure will be watching with my grand children. Although lot of people are are amazed that this movie didn't win an oscar, all I will say is this movie deserved beyond Oscar. An Oscar would have tried to imply that this movie is in class with the others, which it is not."	10
 I'm not that biased--ok, I am. Still worth reading, though.		10
 A masterpiece that leaves you feeling changed.		
 A truely amazing review	This film says everything about the world we live in today, but most importantly give us a sense of hope in our future existence. As a film which basic plot, if considered could of so easily been a flop at the box office. Shawshank turns out to be a movie of the ages, through it stunning cinematography, editing and directing, in no way forgetting its remarkable ensemble crowned in my opinion by the astronomically well realised narration of Morgan Freeman. Tim Robbin execution of Andy not only boasts an inate sense of naturalism that Stanislavski himself would be proud of but characterisation that conveys all emotion that encycles the movie. I short a movie of a generation and of the ages. A must see for any true fan of cinema.	10
 Simply the very, very, very, very best		10
 A work of Art	I've always loved this film. Today I got to see the top 250 of IMDB for the first time and couldn't believe my eyes. There it is, numero duo, number two! But it is there for a reason. This movie is a work of art (that's rare nowadays). The prison environment, the relaxing sound of Morgan Freeman as a story teller and the atmosphere are a combination that makes you almost part of the film. I just can't find the right words to describe the film, but it is still a piece of art. For those who still haven't seen this film: Enjoy.	10
 Best film of the 90s...	With L.A. Confidential running a close second, this is the best film in a surprisingly good decade for movies.  Finally, somebody gets Stephen King right.  The film is based on one of his short novellas, and director Frank Darabont absolutely nails it.  Of course, he has a lot of help from Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows.  All give amazing performances.  Throw in Darabont's screenplay, Roger Deakins' cinematography, and Thomas Newman's score, and you have a bonafide masterpiece.  If you don't dig this movie, please check your pulse.It's a real shame Hollywood did not know how to market this back in 1994, because word-of-mouth came too late for the film to make money or win the Oscars it deserves.  So when you see Shawshank for the first time, you'll wonder how in the hell Forrest Gump won best picture.  To this day, I've never left a movie theater feeling better than when I saw The Shawshank Redemption.	
 I can't express it in words but I've written a 68 word review!	This is a sad film. Its extremely good but its also black in the way that a brick wall in front of a motorway is dangerous. Until the last two minutes its an unrelenting depression. Bang! its sad (the sound of its dark feelings hitting my head.) I can't say anything about this movie. Its beyond good. It is FAULTLESS.

 Morgan Freeman's Best Performance Yet !!!		10
 Best drama ever made.	"In my opinion, the best film ever made.  This film is totally plot driven, and is totally unique in story-line.  The directing and cinematography are astounding, with aerial views of Shawshank prison. One example of this is when Andy plays ""Duettino-Sull 'Aria"" from ""The Marriage of Figaro"".  The camera flies up into the sky like a bird, while all the inmates look up at the speaker.  Truly an amazing film.  WATCH IT!!!!!"	10
 Wauw!!!	I was stunned when I saw The Shawshank redemption for the first time. Now, more than almost 20 times later, I still can't believe the Academy awards jury, how could they not think this the best movie of all times. So moving, so genial, so breathtaking, just great! The first time I saw the movie I 'didn't really intend to watch it, but as it came out, I couldn't stop watching. You really feel for Andy, you really get involved. And than the ending. Who could have thought.....	10
 the greatest film EVER!!!!	Superb acting, superb cast , superb story, superb setting, just a very superb film.It is a great shame that this film was released during the time Forrest Gump came out, otherwise it would have done a lot better at the box office.However, I am glad to see that it is finally getting the acclaim it deserves. SPOILER ALERT I have only seen this film once , but my mum suggested that i watch it and i was blown away by how much this film touched me. This film is far better than Forrest Gump, and has  more emotion to it. I nearly cried when the librarian hung himself when he left prison.Many of my family and friends class this film as one of the best films of all time and in our household we own 2 copies of the film, one  which i own and one which my mum owns. We are both big movie buffs and regard this film as being one of the best and greatest films we have ever seen.	
 Loved it	Wow, what can I say. This film just blew me away entirely. I was never much of a Tim Robbins fan, but now I want to see everything he's in. He carries off his role in this movie with this wonderful quiet dignity and patience. I recommend this film very highly.	
 One of the great love stories	"When I look at the IMDB Top 250 list, I am generally dismayed by both the films that are missing and those that should not be there. However, I am delighted to see The Shawshank Redemption right up at number 2. This movie is absolutely superb, far surpassing the story on which it was based. The plot is brilliant, and once again it shows Morgan Freeman to be one of the greatest actors of all time; it amazes me that he has been given so few awards.When Tim Robbins was interviewed, he called this a ""love story"", and that is exactly what it is - a story of a wonderful (and completely non-sexual) love between two men, a love that is born in an incredible hell-hole and helps to raise them out of it. It's the sort of movie you can watch over and over again and never get tired of it."	10
 Terrific Movie	"This movie is one of the best dramas that I have ever seen.  The movie follows the life of a hot shot banker who is convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover.  He proclaims throughout the movie that he is innocent however.  As the movie progresses we see things inside this prison that we hope never really happens.  There are incidents of brutality, graft, and even murder.  The guards of the prison use the main character, Andy Dufresne, talent as a banker to do their tax returns and the warden uses him to make a fortune.  Andy said it best when he said, ""The funny thing is - on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook.""  Everything was different inside the prison.  This movie shows that no matter what the conditions are they can never completely break someone's spirit which is shown by this movie's happy ending."	
 Quite possible one of the best films ever.	"When this movie first cam eout, I didn't know much about it, my mother, who had seen it, had mentioned something about it being ""very good"" amd a ""prison movie."" I managed to catch it abotu a year later on the Movie Channel, I have to tell you, I sat in awed silence for the next two hours.   Shawshank Redemption isn't just a movie about a bunch of guys in a prison, it's a movie about hope, friendship, and ""coming through clean in the end."" The film is slightly over two hours long, and involving an amazing cast of well acted characters, amazing aerial shots, a wonderful score of music, and inspiration, and the ability to find strength in yourself, that maybe you didnt' know was there. It was a shame this film came out the same year as Forrest Gump, this deserved every award it was nominated for, I highly recommend to anyone to see this film, because it is among one of the best i've ever seen."	10
 No bad word could possibly be said against this film.	When I first saw this film I was completely blown away, it was on T.V. late at night and I was recording it after hearing about it, but after it began I couldn't stop watching it, then again the next day. This film can not be viewed by anyone just once, everybodies performance in this film is excellent, most notably the lead characters. direction, writing, just everything is amazing, and the way it makes you feel when the film ends is quite unlike any film I have ever seen, and doubt ever will again. This is a film that EVERYBODY just HAS to see, something that I have been telling all my friends since.To illustrate how good this film is I was once asked what my favourite films were, I was in a big group of people, in which many walks of life were represented, I mentioned the Shawshank Redemption and every single person there gave out a sigh of appreciation and a slow nod.	10
 How Raquel Welch got back on the wall	"jake1st@yahoo.com asked:  ""Finally, can someone please tell me how he got that poster of Racquel Welch back on the wall after he climbed frontways into that tunnel?""For someone who was apparently closely observing this film, you should have noticed how it was attached to the wall. It was hanging from above. Thus Andy Dufresne would only have to lift it up (like a flap) and it would flap back down behind him.Watch it again if you don't believe me. I believe this is shown twice, if not more."	10
 Saying this is the best film ever made is like claiming McDonalds to be the finest restaurants in the world	I am very disapointed to see that this very average american hollywood film is rated as high as #2 on the top 250.Seeing as the many dozens of reviewers has written before me I will only state why this film qualifies as one of the most overrated films of history.The ONLY thing this movie has is the story and the cutting filmnarratology and even this does not stand out from the rest very much. Based on a mediocre book, this film is a good display of craftsmanship, not art. The way the film tells its story is not creative or new in any way, instead it follows existing hollywood tradition by the book.	
 the ultimate tale of hope in the face of adversity	Shawshank needs to be watched more than once to fully appreciate it. This is a story that is so disparaging at times you want to cry for the character, its so totally immersing that by the end, you feel everything that they feel and along with the happy ending, is laced the whole tragic waste of life that leaves you feeling sad as well. The film itself is simply the finest piece of film making in history. There are no self-indulgent filming techniques used, no abstract elements to the story and the acting is sincere.Based on a story by Stephen King, your getting a character driven story that is acted superbly, the part of Red, played by Morgan Freeman could not have been cast any better, he is utterly superb, as is Andy, played by Tim Robbins and the rest of the supporting cast.If you haven't seen this film, shame on you! You owe it to yourself..	10
 This Film Kick's Ass	"This has got to be the best film that I have ever seen. It is Funny, Emotional and thoroughly enjoyable...It makes you search for a better side of yourself. And it just makes you feel good about yourself. And realise that ""Hope, Will set you Free""."	10
 One of the best film ever made	The first time i saw the Shawshank Redemption i hadn't heard much about it. It was recommended to me by my big brother who had seen it in school. I was amazed, never had i seen such a capturing movie. I was stunned, and especially because this movie had not spend millions of dollars on hi-fi special effects. Tim Robbins played brilliant, I dont understand that he isn't payed as much for his films as; Tom Cruise or Tom Hanks, they couldn't have played this role as convincing as he did, he was fantastic. This is truely one of the great master pieces of the past century.	10
 Classic!!!	One of, if not the best movie ever made. A classic that will last forever. If you have not yet seen this movie, do yourself a favor and BUY it, don't rent it. This is a movie you should own. I'm not a person who only likes certain genres of film. I watch all kinds of different films and this is at the top.	10
 the archetypal battle of good v. evil	Based upon a novella written by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption is unique in that its delivery is more effective as a motion picture than as a work of literature. Enter Andy Defresne- a man convicted of crimes that he did not commit. Such is his reality, and our deepest fear. Tim Robbins offers a stellar performance, depicting a realistic character weighed down by his situation, yet while in the presence of this adversity he does not abdicate hope. His tenacity is unparalleled, and is undoubtedly a characteristic to be admired, if not imitated. Accompanying this man?s quest is a case study of the corruption inherent in American corrective facilities. While many atrocities are brought to light, the resulting product is one of the most life affirming movies I have ever viewed as Andy eventually reaches his 'destination.'	
 Amazing, Makes you happy film	This film never loses its quality no matter how many times you watch it. When I had access to a DVD player, it was one of the first films I bought.I have had a bereavement in the family recently and watching this film certainly lifted my spirits.	10
 The best film you will ever see	I have watched this film so many times, it was my first buy when I bought my DVD player. It is the way that Andy triumphs over the system that can't help but put you in a good mood	10
 A thinking person's film	This film is certainly not disposable, it stays with you for a long time after you watch it.  I have to say that of all the films I have ever watched this is the most captivating.  I remember going to the cinema when it was first out and only choosing it because I had missing the beginning of another picture; how fortunate I was.  To see it on the big screen made the full directing and acting quality of this film apparent from the start, this is not lost on the small screen.  It truly is a classic and I cannot imagine any other film knocking it off my top spot	10
 Best film ever?	Quite possibly. Never before have I seen a film that has satisfied me in every way. The story line is excellent, the acting superb. The way the story fits together is wonderful. I cried tears of joy at the finish, partly because I was so happy for the characters, and partly because I realized I had watched one of the best films ever.	10
 A Joyful Movie	"After seeing this movie a number of times, I felt time it was about time I commented on it. IMHO this is one of greatest movies of all time. It has been called a ""feel-good"" film but I disagree with this it is in fact a joyful movie. Its story acting, direction, location in fact everything are incredible. The movie touches a person on so many different levels; the hate for the ""sisters"", the sorrow and the joy for Andy, the beauty of their friendship and the feeling that everything could be resolved in the world if there were more films like this.To actually rate this movie on any kind of grade is wrong as it exists of level all of its own"	
 One of the classics		10
 Hope		10
 hope is a good thing.	"this film is quite simply ""the greatest film of all time"" and I could wax lyrical about it all day, but I probably would'nt do it any justice by doing this.I saw an programme made by channel 4 (u.k. tv channel) which basically took you through the film, and how this powerful film has effected people's lives. It didn't surprise me, but never the less really does sum up the effect this film can have on some people, when the presenter said that this film has actually stopped some people commiting suicide, because as these people said "" it gave them hope "". Truely I think this is an amazing thing, and the ultimate accolade to the best film I have ever seen."	10
 Timeless	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films of which people used to say ""they don't make 'em like that anymore"". Well, Frank Darabont had the courage to do it and the world owes him a debt of gratitude. With the advent of the 90s there was the feeling that Hollywood, and Hollywood audiences, could never again accept such a thoughtful, emotional and ""feelgood"" movie as Shawshank. It shouldn't have been made in this era but thank God it was. Stick it in black and white and it could quite easily have come right out of the 50s along with It's A Wondeful Life. Most 90s films to which the critics automatically responded with the word ""classic"", Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, Fight Club, may or may not endure ""the test of time"" but there's no such doubts about The Shawshank Redemption. It is a true classic."	10
 Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!	The first time I saw this movie it took my breath away, everytime I have watched it since it still has the same effect on me! One of my favourite films of all time!!!!!!!! I have recommended it to other people who have said 'it's only a prison movie', but after they have seen it they ALL changed their minds! And agree is a life changer not just a movie.	10
 Best Film Ever	This is the best film I have ever seen. there where so many twists and more than one plot running at the same time. A great piece of film making. I feel the ending was the perfect ending, I know how they where going to end the film, with Morgan Freeman on the bus hoping to see his friend. my all time best film.	10
 Call the police!!!!! There's been a robbery!	"(Note: Some plot-spoilers included)Yes! That's right!  The Shawshank Redemption would like to report that it was robbed of seven thoroughly deserved Oscars.Why? From it's ascentive messages of hope to the powerful redemptive affects felt - not only by the characters but also the audience, Frank Darabont has created a true masterpiece.We all know that Freeman and Robbins provide superlative performances, while less credit is often given to James Whitmore as Brooks - the backdrop to Red's ultimate redemption - showing what could have happened to Red without Andy.  An amazing assortment of minor characters litter this film, and while admittedly there are a lot of prison cliches, they manage to work - cliches aren't always bad remember - they have to be said by a lot of people first!Cinematography: Hello? Did you see the scene when Andy first arrives at Shawshank with the overhead view of the prison - which shows emphatically the extent of the ""closed wall"" syndrome that leads to the ""institutionalized"" sections?  Ohh, and don't forget THAT scene - you know what I mean - Andy using the recurring metaphor of water once he's escaped! The metaphor of Christ's journey ending in the washing away of Andy's memories of Shawshank in his crucifiction pose takes the breath away. This film is truly special.After reading the original novella by Stephen King, I looked forward to watching the Shawshank Redemption when it was bought for me on video - and Darabont not only does a great job at directing, but his adaptation of the novella is superb as well.The ending, while not containing the big budget special effects that most modern films seem to require as a neccesity nowadays, is a wonderful conclusion to a film that reaffirms faith in humanity. Thank you to all concerned in making the film."	
 moviemaking perfection	"having watched ""shawshank the redeeming feature"" broadcast here in the u.k. last night i thought it was time to add my voice to the plaudits rightly showered on this wonderful movie i have never met anyone who doesn't believe that it is one of the greatest films ever made it crosses demographic,age and sex barriers like almost no other film that i have come across it is an impossible film to ignore and notwithstanding repeated viewing it maintains it's capacity to inspire and captivate in my view it is rightly lauded as one of the best five movies of all time p.s. well done mark kermode and channel4 for last night's documentary-more of this type of thing please dvd extras have shown that there is definitely a market for these sort of documentaries"	10
 simply, the best	"Spoiler Alert A few films can presume of the importance that a film like The Shawshank Redemption does. Shawshank Redemption is considered by some critics as one of the best movies in the story of American film (listed as #2 by the Internet Movie Data Base,http://www.imdb.com). For many other people the film is considered as one of those films which theme is universal and that transcends throughout the ages and decades. And this is because topics like freedom, justice and injustice, greed and honesty, and perseverance are mixed in a manner that specifies what the human condition is and will be.The performances given by Tim Robbins and the always acclaimed Morgan Freeman give the film the emotional touch that is easy to get as a viewer. The story is centered in a person called Andy Dufrense who was convicted for the murder of his wife, him, being a young and intelligent banker was one of the most promising persons in his category, but all his potential was brought down with his conviction, undoubtely unfair since it is obvious a person like Dufrense wouldn´t be capable of such a thing like murdering the person he loved with all his heart. Also the story of the ""institutionalized"" Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played wonderfully by Morgan Freeman, a man who lost all hope of ever going out even if he had already payed more than he had ever expected for his crime, until he met Dufrense, who as anyone could see teaches Red the meaning of what to have a dream is, even if it takes you 20 years to accomplish it.Greed comes in form of Captain Byron Hadley played by lancy Brown, an unscrupulous man, who ironicly although he directed the place were the ""bad"" element of society is reformed he was no better than the ones he subdued. Hadley since he first met Dufrense sought in him his golden egg gouse and used him to fulfill a fraud becoming Dufrense now into a real criminal, which he wasn´t until he got to jail. When the opportunity to prove Dufrense´s innocence comes, Hadley makes everything as possible to avoid that even though the assesination of a young person was in the middle. At the end, Dufrense escapes from jail through a hole he had dug for 20 years covering the evidence with several posters from the hollywood divas from those times from Rita Hayworth to Jane Fonda.But, let´s talk about Andy Dufresne for a while, let´s take the scene at the roof of the building in which Andy gets beers for his coworkers in exchange for work. At the end of the scene we can see the smile of Andy, a happy man, who was happy with small little accomplishments. Andy was someone who was talented and yet, all he wanted was a yat in Puerto Vallarta near by the beach and that would be the heaven for him. In a world full of intelligent people who use their talents to get to the top, andy was one who needed little to be happy.Of course the success of this film is based on what most of the famous films do, an utopic idea of society or how the human being should have been. Andy is the prototype of how all of us should be, never loose the sense of hope, always fight for what you want, greed and money is not good, and of course, being like this you will always succeed. After all, a movie that should be seen by everyone."	9
 For all those who haven't seen it yet (and don't want the story ruined)		10
 Sheer Brilliance	The best movie I have ever seen -- by a mile.  Everything about it is brilliant.  A classic you can watch time and again without tiring of it. The acting is fantastic throughout -- Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are at their very best.  And rookie director, Frank Darabont has created a real masterpiece.	
 The first better-than-its-original adaptation	"I'm a fan of King's work. And I confess that, when I first saw the Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption, I didn't like it very much. After I heard the coming adaptation in 1994, I thought to myself ""It's gonna be a cliche prison movie"". But when I first watched it on the big screen, I was totally shocked. I think they made a great favor to Forrest Gump and Tom Hanks that year. The 6 academy awards was meant to be for this film. I still get the same excitement while watching this one over and over again. Now I'm waiting for the DVD version for the  film. And I also like to see a special edition for this one...."	10
 Very well-acted, well-told, and entertaining tale...	but the #2 movie of all-time ??!!? It's all opinion, of course.  However, I doubt even Stephen King or Tim Robbins would vote for this enjoyable saga as the #2 all-time movie.  It is a marvelous adaptation of King's short story.  Robbins, Freedman, and Gunton are all terrific, as is James Whitmore in his short role. My biggest criticism is the slow detailing of Red's every move after being released from prison, and before going after the fortune.  That part was a bit labored and overlong.  Nonetheless, the movie was witty, exciting, and well-acted, but was purposefully limited in scope.  Very good, yes! Excellent? Perhaps.  Great?  I must demur on great.	8
 Oh, just read the review below!		
 Awesome	I saw this film about 4 or 5 years ago after hearing nothing but praise about it. After reading the blurb I couldn't wait to get the tape in. Since then I have seen the film numerous times and am still not bored. It truly is a classic in every essence of the word. In my opinion possibly the best film of all time, maybe 2nd only to Forrest Gump. They truly don't make film's like this any more.	10
 Decent, but not fantastic	I must say that I was I little surprised to see the euphoric comments that other users have bestowed on The Shawshank Redemption. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I would not place it with the cinematic greats. It has an excellent storyline that both surprises and ultimately satisfies, and is well acted. However, there is little flair in its direction and some of its characters are a little cliched. To sum up, the Shawshank Redemption is an enjoyable film with some well thought out twists to the tale, but the 2nd best film of all time? I don't think so.	10
 Simply a masterpiece	"What a remarkable film this is. I remember the first time I saw it. It was on video, since I was only 11 when it came out, and I sat down, and I had heard that it was a terrific movie, but I had no idea just how truly GREAT this movie is. After the first viewing I knew it was one of my favorites. I've only seen it three times, so as not to wear it out, and each time, I am blown away.Morgan Freeman is already one of my favorite actors, (Along with Kevin Spacey, James Cromwell, and Edward Norton) and his performance here is simply the best of his career. His ""Red"" is a weathered man who has lost hope. He's not a ""bad"" man, even though he did kill a man in his youth. Morgan Freeman is calm and collected, yet his on-screen presence is so powerful. We are drawn to him, almost more-so than to Andy because Andy keeps to himself, while Red narrates. This is partly the point, to turn the audience into an inmate. We only know as much as they do about him. He isn't revealed to us directly very much. And we eventually find out why.I love the way the men of this prison use almost a hierarchy and establish their own little kingdom, with the jail, obviously as their castle. I like watching Andy as he strives to be normal, doing whatever he can to get his mind off of the fact that he's in prison. One of the film's best moments comes when Andy makes a deal that allows all of the roof workers to have a beer, and to just sit around, and be carefree for a few minutes. But for others the prison is normal, all they know, their only life. They call it ""institutionalized"" but what it really means is hopeless. And it's a constant battle to keep that from happening. And eventually it seems, that everyone caves in to the fact that they will die at that place.This is unquestionably one of the most powerful and moving films of all time. (WARNING: SPOILERS!!!) There are four ending sequences that come one after another that move so fluidly and with such grace that I am in awe just thinking about it. 1. Andy's escape and all of the explanation that goes along with it. The long tunnel of crap, Andy's joy in the pond while the rain pours upon him. 2. The day after and everything that happens to the warden and the guard are done brilliantly. 3. Red's parole hearing. At this point he just doesn't give a crap about anything anymore. He talks about his regret, not because he thinks it will get him out, but so that they will know that his punishment is not so much prison as it is wishing he could've made a better decision. Wishing that the young Red would've had guidance. 4. The reunion at the end while Red narrates. The most wonderful lines come when he's on the bus, and we hear his voice over about how he has shrugged off his ""Institutionalization"" and is ready to not know what happens next. This is the absolute perfect tone to end the movie on. What sheer brilliance. It is sad that this film didn't win ANY Oscars. It certainly deserved to."	10
 Incredibly Good	Any other year, this would've won Best Picture.  Probably Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Screenplay too.  This film had the misfortune of going against juggernaut Forrest Gump, and there was no way that it could beat the hype surrounding the good (though not great) Gump.  Still, seven years later, it looks like this is the film from 1994 that people will remember long after Forrest has faded away.	10
 A tremendous story and well done film.		
 Fantastic	A wonderfully scripted film complimented by the acting qualities of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.This is by far the best film I have ever seen and I would recommend that every movie fan see it.	10
 quite simply one of the greatest films in living memory!!	the film is unique as it seems like the same old story but keeps you absolutely riveted from the opening line to the end credits and one of the things which i personally like the best is the way that we never really find out if he is innocent or not if you have not seen this movie i strongly suggest that it is one of the things that should be very high on your things to do list but dont just listen to me you can see that it is number 2 on the list	10
 Amazing Masterpiece	"I saw this movie last week and I must say that it is the most wonderfull movie ever made in human history. It contains all elements that makes a movie big, and how big, damn I was completely blown away when the movie ended. Its about a man (Andy Dufresne)(Tim Robbins) who is judged guilty and ends up in ""ThE ShAwShAnK PrIsOn"", he meets Red (Morgan Freeman) and become friends, I've never seen such a great acting like this two together. Andy Dufresne is the hope itself and has to face a hard time in prison till...Im not gonna reveal the movie any further because YOU MUST SEE IT, Its just the best movie ever made, Memento, Schindler's list and American History X were awsome but this one will blow you completely away! 10 out of 10 and even more if it could be. --------ENJOY IT--------"	10
 best movie ever	best movie ever. better than all other movies. even godfather which is number one on this site's top 250. best movie ever                                         17 out of 10                                           ***** out of ****	10
 What a movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	Could not sleep at night after watching this film. One of the BEST DAMN films EVER made. Simply loved it. Rented it without much expectation, but boy what a surprise. Never have I been so moved by a film. Also see American Beauty, Green Mile. A MUST SEE! 10/10	10
 WOW	This movie is so much more than you expect.  There is a deep kind of faith in it which makes this movie great.  Its sad that this movie did poor in the box office it deserves so much more. a must see. its always on tv so see it.	
 Best movie that I have ever seen.	This movie is truly moving. It draws you in and takes you along with the characters as they live their lives. The plot is extremely well developed. Every character has a lot of depth and the acting is top notch. The end gives me goose bumps every time that I watch it. I can never get enough of it. I have seen the movie at least 50 times and just writing about it makes me want to go watch it again. You will not be disappointed with The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 The best	i first saw this movie on tv many years ago. i loved it from the start. ever since then i have seen clips and quotes from it all over my daily life. watching it again, i realize how truly wonderful it is. not only is the acting some of the best i have ever seen, the script is very well written and the message it gives stays with you. this movie is the best i have ever seen.	10
 Superb, moving, possibly the greatest film of all time	It is tough to summarize the true power of this truly great film. It was moving, thought-provoking, and powerful. It was truly robbed of the 1994 Best picture, just because Forrest Gump was more succesful in theatres. Shawshank was much deeper, and i was a great injustice. Shawshank chronicled the relationship between two jailed inmate through the 40's, 50's and 60's. It was a film about how no matter how hard a man is broken, beaten down, and crushed emoionally he still can keep hope. I truly loved this film and it grows better with each viewing. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman gave great performances in this film. Frank Darabot had great direction over this film, and Stephen King's short story was great. This is a must see for anyone. Like I said before this is in my opinion the greatest fim ever made.	10
 An actute study of humanity	First-time director/screenwriter Frank Darabont expands Stephen King's 1982 short story 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', into one of the most definitive, moving and uplifting films to be made in recent years. 'The Shawshank Redeption' is not just an acute prison drama, it remains a detailed an emotional study of humanities endeavour against hardship and repression. A standout performance by Morgan Freeman and dazeling direction by Darabont, are abetted by elaborate panoramic cinematography, a touching score and a malicious imposing character - the oppressive 'Shawshank State Prison' itself. A melodrama of wasted lives and male bonding, nominated for 7 academy awards dispite a lukewarm box office reception.	
 The best Stephen King adaption ever...	...followed,very closely,behind by Stand By Me.The novella Rita Hayworth... is one of his best as well,so when I heard that it was being made into a film,i was worried at how it came out.All that worrying was for nothing.Superb performances(Sorry, but where was the Oscars for Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont etc),a script that sticks to the novella but doesn't get bogged down in over plotting(like Pet Semetary) and some brilliant direction make this one of the truly great films of the 1990's.Pity about The Green Mile (1999)...	10
 over-rated	When I saw this movie on the top 250 movies of all time list (it appeared as #2) I thought I was in for one of the best movies ever made.  Yes, it was an interesting story, but it seemed much too unrealistic to be among the top 10.  I mean sure, The Sixth Sense, one of my favorite movies, is unrealistic, but we realize that going into the movie.  It doesn't play itself off as a real movie about real friendships.  The movie was worth seeing, but the way everything fell into place was really disturbing for me.  That's not real life.  I give the movie a 7 out of 10, in that, it was a good movie, but it certainly wasn't the best.	8
 Blown Away (Spoilers)	"I saw this movie after I saw ""The Green Mile."" I loved ""The Green Mile"" and thought that I should see another prison movie with the same director. Boy was I glad I did.  The one thing I love about this movie is it's wonderful ending. I felt like that was the best thing that could have happened at that time. I loved it. The only thing I didn't like was that I felt that the wardon got off easy. He died instantly. In my eyes he should of had to go to prison and live a horrible life. Oh well. This is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen and I encourage everyone to see it. I cannot believe that someone would dare give this movie a 1. If you did, please e-mail me so I can thoroughly yell at you. Oh, did anyone else notice that the music seemed very similar to the music in ""The Green Mile?"" 10/10"	10
 My All-Time Favorite Movie	"Spoilers ahead... This movie, which was entertaining from start to finish, had the greatest ending that I have ever seen.  Too many movie makers have unhappy endings just because it seems more realistic. (see Sean Penn's ""The Pledge"")  The ending to this movie couldn't have been more perfect.  I'm usually pretty good at predicting how a movie is going to end, but this one had me fooled all the way.  Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman had great chemistry throughout this picture.  I encourage everyone to see it."	
 If you want to escape in a prison, choose Shawshank.	What a great movie, written by: Stephen King. Original title: Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. This movie has got 7 oscar nominations, but didn't get 1. I don't know why, because this was one of the best movies in 1994.It's about a man Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is guilty on a double murder of his wife and her boyfriend.In this whole movie you find out about his life and if he's guilty or not. Great acting by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. (10/10)	10
 Wonderful Movie	This one is a winner.  It was a sad movie... and unacceptable for young kids to watch but a real good movie.... I am a big fan of the two main actors.. Tim Robbins,, and Morgan Freeman. Does anyone know if this movie was based on a true story?What a wonderful ending also... and as I said before in other comments, I love happy endings.	
 Someone needed to make a film with as much power as The Shawshank Redemption!		10
 A great story, with great performances		10
 this is my favorite movie of all time!	I love this movie, best movie ever made. I garuntee that if you see this movie for the fist time, it will be in your top ten after you finish watching it. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both diserved the best male oscar award for this picture.	10
 wow	tim robbins and morgan freeman are great in the film it movies you in every way the movie is based on 20 years of these men lives and goes up and down the whole way and made very realistic and people can relate to it you cant not like this master peace it's the best movie ive seen in a while .	9
 Sweet and Safe	"If Hollywood were the bakery section at your local supermarket, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would be that sweet rich carrot cake they sometimes have--obviously commercially produced to appeal to as many people as possible, but nevertheless infinitely better than a plastic-wrapped snack-cake like ""Forrest Gump"", which goes down easy but leaves a funny taste in your mouth for hours afterward.Of course if this movie were a cake, I suppose it'd have a file in it."	8
 Extremely Well Made, Well Acted, and Cheated at the Oscars	"After I saw Darabont's ""Green Mile"" I heard that he had another movie, and I had to see it.  I taped Shawshank on TV and watched it, not expecting a lot. Well, it wasn't as good as ""Green Mile,"" but it was pretty darned close, and it was quite similar in terms of themes and character types.  I thought the warden was terrific.  I was so engrossed in the movie, I wanted to strangle the man myself.  Although many say the movie was predictable, I was quite surprised by the ending.  As in the case of the ""Green Mile,"" the awards Shawshank richly deserved were passed on to other, not so good, films. The only downside was the portrayal of the characters.  The movie basically said that criminals are good guys, and the prison guards are villains. Isn't it the other way around?I give Shawshank a 9/10"	9
 The greatest movie I have ever seen!	I LOVE the Shawshank Redemption. It gives the story of a prison inmate in his many years at an institution. This movie is so great, I cried in the middle of it! When Brooks dies has got to be the saddest moment in movie history. I cried for a good 10 minutes. He let his bird go, and he took his life. Very sad stuff. It's great how they start up a library helping the illiterate inmates. It shows some of the atrocites that inmates go through even if they are innocent. A VERY GREAT movie and probably the best of all time. I give it an A++++++.	10
 The film has lingered with me for a long time....	"Great lead performances by Robbins and Freeman. An outstanding supporting cast, fine cinematography by Roger Deakins, well-chosen shots by editor Richard Francis-Bruce, a haunting musical score by Thomas Newman, and a well-realized adaptation of the short story by Stephen King as adapted and directed by Frank Darabont.  What still amazes me about the overall positive response to ""Shawshank"" on the IMDb is how it touched viewers years after it was released into theaters. I saw the movie in the theaters after it received a few weeks after the Oscar nominations were announced. I was blown away by the movie then and it still gets to me now."	10
 A more spherical attitude towards this excellent movie		10
 Brotherhood and altruism blossom from Andy Dufrane	It's rare to find a modern movie of this caliber. 'Shawshank' is not cheapened with some feel-good Hollywood romance, heroic fight scenes, or a fast paced, edge-of-your-seat escape plan. In place of this ever-present drivel, this movie excites the heart and warms the soul through the excellent performances, exquisite story-line, and unforgettable quotes. Andy demonstrates a heroic spirit and an indomitable will to touch the lives of those around him.	10
 Some films are just magical in their own way	This film appeals to anyone, thats why its #2 on IMDB. This film for some reason made only 28 million at the box-office. I love Forrest Gump I really do, but this is the best picture if the year. It has some sorta quality that is rare in films that instead of pulling you away, it draws you closer. The 30th time you watch this film, you will still be drawn in closer. The film is magical. Don't ever forget that.	10
 Redemption on the IMDB.	I have just finished watching this movie for about the sixth time and I still feel the inspiration of hope in my heart from the movie's glorious ending. I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and yes this is my favourite movie. I'm sure there's others which tie in my taste for best picture I just can't bring them to mind right now. (Actually, come to think of it The Breakfast Club ranks pretty high up there as well.)I just wanted to say that this movie is very well done all the way from the acting, the storyline, to the musical track it wins on all three fronts for me. And I also wanted to say that it may have been robbed at the Oscars or almost passed through unrecognized by the public in its theatrical release, or may have even made not that much money it seems to have been redeemed itself on the IMDB with a well deserved #2 ranking among the favourites IMDB voters voted for. A must see.	10
 Pure Masterpiece	I see like 1400 people rated this movie a 1 out of 10.  Please, if you are one of these people, email me so we can talk, and so i can ultimately rip your soul apart and see what it is like to be non-human.  As far as the movie goes, im sure not many people have seen it, if you havent, please do so, you wont be sorry.	10
 hope vs. certainty	Interpretation, spoilers: Brooks represents complete complacency with life, so much so that any disturbance causes anxiety and suicidal ideation. Red also, for a time, represents this complacency. This movie is not simply a prison story, its message is generalized to mankind in general and it can be assumed that this complacency also represents modern man's need for routine - to the detriment of authentic living. It takes an unjustly imprisoned man, Andy, to demonstrate to Red the life-or-death importance of hope and the freedom allowed by hope. As shown, hope entails slight fear because it necessarily interferes with order in life. Andy illustrates that this fear is a part of living, and renunciation from it results in an ingenuine sort of living. Red soon realizes - given the rock hammer, the poster, and the mexico plans - that Andy had never given up his hope despite 19 years in prison. Hope and a sense of freedom and allowed even in prison, but not to all (music scene). For Red, it takes an actual physical freedom to live with a sense of hope. Andy, by exuding auras of hope from the beginning - though he would be expected to despair the most given his innocence - helps Red reach an epiphany of sorts; certainty and hope are mutually exclusive, and hope is always to be preferred. The Brook's path is shirked, and Red chooses life in all of its confusion, because true hope is omnipotent.	9
 Perfection	"I would describe this movie as as close you can get to movie perfection. There are points where you will laugh. Points where you will cringe. Points will you will feel so angry and points where you will feel so sad. But, ultimately, you will come to realize that with faith and hope, anything is possible. (Warning content and quote given ahead) The language is a bit extreme, but it is set in a prison, and as the character Red says in the movie, ""Prison ain't a fairy tale world"" (Paraphrase). This isn't a family movie, but every movie fan needs to see this at least once. This is my favorite movie."	10
 A Wonderfully compelling Film	Very few movies can move moods so subtly and then surprise you at the end, but this one did that for me.A skillfully evocative piece that shows the rewards of morality and undying faith.	9
 A Film With a Life of Its Own		9
 Unbelivable	This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen no matter who you are you should love this movie and if you havn't seen it, see it! Tim Robbins gives a performance that is probly one of the most unforgetable also Morgan Freeman gives just as good of a performance. This movie has no flaws and it is SO good	10
 Best film ever!!	I have seen TSR about 5 or 6 times now, and every time I watch it, it's getting better! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are great together and the end of the movie is the best movie ending ever!! A tale of courage and friendship. Go see it!!!	10
 You're insane if you don't like this movie.	"Two words: Flawless masterpiece.  While not the greatest movie ever made, it should certainly rank extremely high.  Unless you're completely repulsed by the idea of a prison film, or if you're too immature to appreciate good drama, you're going to absolutely love, love, love this film.  This film was largely overlooked at the time because of the mega-popular ""Forrest Gump"" (an extremely excellent film in its own right), but it holds up because of a timeless quality that very few films possess (I know the film's only 7 years old, but I think that's long enough).  If you're uncomfortable with some of the more graphic themes of the movie, it's still worth a look (certain cable networks regularly show an edited for TV version of the movie).  This is a must see for anyone who calls themselves a film-buff."	10
 Best Movie Ever.	"I watch it at least once a week. Changed the way I live my life. Better than medicine when your feeling down or depressed. Still searching for some people out there who haven't seen it. I love watching it with someone who has never seen it, just to see their reaction. It's like I'm watching the film for the first time. The best movie ever, ""that's god damn right""!"	10
 be careful, because you will be drawn into this one	Sat down one evening and happened to catch this about  5 min. into it, and was stuck on the couch for 2 hours. Have no doubts about picking this up for a quiet, entertaining, enjoyable evening. Great story, well acted and engrossing. Robbins and Freeman are excellent, like Hoffman and Mcqween in Papillion. If  you don't find tears in welling in your eyes and a smile on your face seek resuscitation.,   ENJOY!!!	
 Far too good to be missed!!!!!	I have seen this movie many times and I still get that wonderful feeling every time I see it. I love it so much that I have so far bought 6 vcds for my friends and they all love it. And if you want to know why, just see it for yourself.	10
 Beautifully	One of the best films I've ever seen...it got all the elements from life. Hope, struggle, suffer, friendship, joy and all the other things all performed by the best actors around. Morgan Freeman (as always) and Tim Robbins make this movie something that everyone should see, It's pure pleasure all the way...	10
 Quite simply, the best story in the history of motion pictures.		10
 Deeply moving, yet very realistic!	This film is up there with the classics!  Is a deeply moving story, which portrays friendship, trust, hope and corruption.  The ending is superb, and brings a smile to my face every single time i watch it.  It shows a very realistic view of prisons in the 1930's where the officers were almost, or even more corrupt and evil than the inmates.  This is film which will never become outdated or even considered to be 'coming of age'.  With superb acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, it has to be the best film I have seen in a long long time.	10
 Quite a film	This is quite a story, and the film does an incredible job of telling it. The acting is magnificent, and the quality of the direction makes this film a pleasure to watch.  A great film for the human spirit, and the importance of freedom to our well-being.  I voted 10/10 for Shawshank.	10
 Simply excellent!	This is my favorite movie of the 90's. Fantastic script & dialogues, excellent actors, direction, photography. The best prison movie ever. One of the few movies you can see thousand times and never get bored. I recommend it to anyone that haven't seen it so far!Antonis	10
 simple, pure, beautiful cinema in a world of mediocrity		
 Deeply moving		10
 Greatest movie never to win the oscar.		10
 The movie medium at it's finest	This is what movies are truly made for.  This is movie making as an art form.  This movie deeply conveys more human insight than I thought possible in something so short and simple as a film.  It deals with sin, love, friendship, fear, greed, persistence, frailty, hope, courage, cruelty and a whole array of other human traits, and it deals with all of them in an amazingly complex and full manner.  This is a prime example of a creation that allows us to understand another's soul.  It does this through words, sounds, facial expressions, in short, everything that a movie can offer us in condensed form that we often don't pay attention to in life.  We have to pay attention here.  We can't look away.  If you can come out of this movie without finding something out about yourself you haven't really experienced it, perhaps you've just watched it.  I give very few movies a 10, because nothing man made can ever really be perfect, but some things come close. This is one.	9
 Hope is a dangerous thing; can kill a man.	A phenomenal film. A rare gem that surpasses entertainment, resonating with meaning and enlightenment. The film, and the Stephen King novella it derives from, are a treasure. Even if you're not a big reader, seek out Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption. It's contained in a collection of 4 novellas - one for each season. After you've seen the film, it should be apparent which season Shawshank is allocated. The book also has enough deviations, including a different ending, to keep you enthralled even if you've seen the film several times.	10
 one of my favorites	I love films and this might just be my favorite. A simple movie about hope. A feel good movie, that will make you cheer for the human spirit! Great cast of characters. Wonderful acting by Robbins and Freeman, a true must see movie...	
 A terrific movie with layers of meaning...		10
 Morgan Freeman's come a LONG way	"This ain't ""The Electric Company.""  Although all of the performances in this film are masterful (showing by turns both the depravity and the humanity of the prison experience) Morgan Freeman's role as ""Red"" is truly the centerpiece of this film - so good it defies description.  All I can say is that of all the movies I own on DVD, this is one of my proudest purchases; a film I can play that not only shows off how good digital quality looks but that shows off how an excellent screenplay and great actors can come together to make a cinematic masterpiece."	10
 Fantastic! (spoiler alert!)	Tremendously involving drama. In my opinion, the best new movie in the last 10 years or so. My only quibble is that the film deals with prison life in a somewhat unrealistic, non-threatening or idealistic way compared to some prison movies but otherwise it is terrific. The main characters are quite human and engaging. I found myself almost projecting, mentally, into the group as they share their day-to-day experiences in the joint. Also, the film has a happy ending where the good guy succeeds and the bad guy gets his.	10
 nice really nice	last summer I saw ( for the 6 time) this film again I don't know why but I was terribly shock by this film and today it always make me feel bizarre . I don't know how they do this film but it was really good. I think that this film is one of my favorite with the sixth sense and terminator 2 (sorry but it remind me my teenage) .	10
 some random thoughts about a great film		10
 The Perfect Film?	This beautiful film from Frank Darabont is an absolute joy to behold.  a wonderful blend of drama, warmth, sadness and joy.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have never been better, giving performances that should have won the relevant oscars hands down, but they and Frank Darabont(director) were absolutley robbed on Oscar night. This is a film that deserves to be watched again and again.Let's not forget Thomas Newman's moving score that captures the film's mood perfectly, where you can close your eyes and feel the emotions running through your whole body. This film is also a rarity in that this is probably the best film adaption of a Stephen King story since The Dead Zone.The Perfect Film?  I think perhaps it is.	
 Best movie i have ever seen	This is the best movie i have ever seen, because of the purity of the scenario and the stresses. The film emphasizes nearly all good and bad characteristics of the human in a way that everybody can understand and taste. I felt myself like i was there and the camera was my eyes.Everbody who wants to learn more about the value of the virtues he/she house , must see this film before he or she dies.	10
 Touching, Laughter, Astonishing	"There is not much to say about this movie. Shawshank has it all. Good characters, story, and acting. It is not my favorite movie, but is probably the greatest movie ever made. Watching this movie made me think what life is really like. I was moved by every minute of the movie and when it was done.... I almost thought it was real life.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant. You couldn't ask for anyone better for the part. Their acting in this movie made you cry and changed the turn for the movie industry. This movie is worth every second, so don't miss ""The Shawshank Redemption""."	10
 Simply astonishing	I'm always simply out of words after watching this film. The score, the actors, the plot, everything just strikes me. I've seen this on DVD about five times now and it hasn't lost one bit of it's glory. If you haven't seen this film, see it now. If you saw it and didn't like it, maybe you should give it another chance.I remember seeing it from TV when I was about 12 or 13. I Didn't really have any opinions about it then. It was good, but nothing special. I decided to buy the DVD anyway and after watching it 5 years later I finally got more deeper into the movie.This is one of the best, if not best movie ever made. And I mean it.	10
 Probably the best film ever!	I'm not much of a film critic so ill only write a few lines.This film is amazing, the script is by far the best ever, the story-line is so original. The acting is done superbly especially Morgan Freeman. The characters are really written well, and the film will keep you guessing about what is going to happen next. The ending is truly amazing! If you have not seen this film yet, SEE IT!10/10	10
 Simply the best film ever	This film was honestly able to make me laugh, and cry. It moved me from start to finish. I have seen several films in my lifetime, and I have given this film the distinct honor of my favorite, and the best film of all time. It shows the character development and friendship between inmates of several years. Everyone should see this film, because It is incredible. The scene where they are drinking beers never fails to make me cry or at least get teary-eyed.	10
 THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER!	Hello, my name is Ed and I would like to say that at first this movie looked kind of stupid when I was at Block Buster but I remembered that at IMDB it got a 9.0 rating and is the 2nd best movie of all time so I rented it. When I got home I watched it and I was amazed by it. This movie is incredible. The movie is not really about prison but about people and the hardships they face and endure. While I was watching it there were several parts of the movie where you think it is over but there is realy more to see which was great because you don't want this movie to end. The story unfolds and more stuff is going on in the movie then you think. My advice for anyone who wants to see the greatest movie ever is to go out and either rent this movie or buy it. It is worth it. You wont get sick of this masterpiece.	10
 probably the best film ever made		10
 Simply a hell of a film	"Not exactly a movie you would think to have Stephen King in the credits, which gives the film a sense of irony. When watching the film, one experiences many emotions, and though not enough to make most people cry, enough to leave you reeling. Our hero Andy (Tim Robbins)quite frankly goes through a lot, but is steered toward the right direction because of his undying hope of getting out. Andy also leads fellow inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) ""to the light"", and teaches us all how important hope is to have within us. I guess another good point is just how many films can you name that have happy endings, and aren't in any way at least slightly corny?"	10
 A trully work of art, where the word art itself comes up short!		10
 One of the best pictures I have ever seen	I first saw this masterpiece two years ago and since then it has been on my favourite movie list.  This is one of those movies that once you see it you can't stop watching it.  It has a very very good story line. The only thing that is bad about this movie is that most people have to see it from the beginning to like it and really appreciate it.	10
 It doesn't get any better than this	The best film I've ever seen.  As soon as I got a DVD player I made sure this was among my first purchases.  I watched it 3 times that week and a several more times in the following few months. If you haven't seen this film yet, rent it today.  Better yet, buy it, because you'll definitely want to see it more than once!	10
 A Great movie	I love this movie I guess that I have seen it over ten times,I don't know what makes this movie good, but I must recommend it. When I was in the Video store I was very sceptical about it but that changed 10 minutes after I started the film. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.	10
 Amazing.		
 WOW	"There is no movie that I love more than The Shawshank Redemption. I have seen the movie at least 10 times, and it never ceases to amaze me how well it is performed. The plot line is one of the best that I have seen in a long time, and Tim Robbins plays his character as if he were living in that life. The most amazing thing happened after I watched this movie: I started to regard everyone with the same ""look inside of me instead of at me"" view, and have lately even started to think ""innocent until PROVEN guilty"" and not ""he looks guilty so he must be."" If you have not seen this movie, you are missing out on an extremely well written and performed piece of art. I highly reccomend it. In fact, I urge anyone who has not seen it to rent it tonight."	10
" Definite ""must own"""	This is one of the really great movies. Excellent casting. The actors worked together to form an exceptional cast. Telling the story through the eyes of another inmate added a pleasurable twist to the movie. Definitely one of the core films of any video library.	10
 Wonderful	This movie is great.   It combines a heart touching story with great actors. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are spectacular along with a great supporting crew.  The movie also depicted the book in a very accurate way. I highly recommend this movie.	9
 quite simply the greatest film ever made	"First and foremost , the shawshank redemption is a brilliant piece of film-making. It follows the story of andy dufresne(an excellent tim robbins) and his struggle to maintain hope inside a maximum secruity prison.It also focuses on his friendship with the prison""fixer"" red(beautifully portrayed by morgan freeman). It has such an intelligent script that makes the film`s final appeal the indefinable quality of ""feel good"". Frank darabont must be wondering what he has to do to win an oscar now as he has also made the excellent ""green mile"". I dont really want to say too much about the story as i will let you discover the twist and turns that happen in shawshank prison.But i will say something , i was totally gobsmacked by the extraordinary twist in the tale. If you have not yet seen the film , forget about renting it , GO BUY IT ON VIDEO AND DVD NOW and enjoy 137 minutes of the greatest film ever made."	10
 What can I say, a brilliant film!	I saw Shawshank quite a few years ago now. However, upon visiting the IMDB Top 250 list and finding it two from the top, I was not surprised. Despite the fact that I saw the movie is 1996 or 1997, I can still remember some of the poignant momments in the film and how the entire film made me feel (heartfelt and happy!).Overall, I think Shawshank was an absoloutely amazing film. It showcases great performances from both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and also demonstrates the quality of writing that people should expect from somebody like Steven King.	10
 Shawshank is a touchstone.	The Shawshank Redemption is by FAR my favorite movie. It is the touchstone or benchmark I judge all other movies by. It has everything I love about movies and nothing that I usually hate. This is the only movie I think I can give a rating of 10.	10
 The best film from a Stephen King story....	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the best film from a Stephen King story. The best by far.  This film fits together so intricately and the end seems almost impossible.  It's what everyone wants, of course, but it just doesn't seem possible.  This movie could not be more perfectly cast, and the direction is impeccable.  The story draws you in.  This movie and ""The Green Mile"" are alike in the sense that they capture your attention for the entire film.  These films are powerful and well-made.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" sits on another level.  It is a film that will not grow old.  It will stay fresh and fulfilling as the years go by.  This is a must-see film.  To go without seeing this movie is quite a loss.  Do yourself a favor and see this quality flick!"	10
 One of My all time 10 best.	A must see if you're even wondering. This will also become one of your favorites. Great characters, acting, screenplay, everything. They did a great job of getting Kings book to the screen. One of the best and most memorable endings in movie history. Sit back, dim lights, shut off phone, and enjoy!	10
 I can understand why this was the number 1 movie for so long!	Tens of thousands of IMDB users couldn't be wrong, this movie REALLY IS THE BEST. I am an avid movie watcher, and I LOVE this movie. I rate it as a 20 out of a possible 10.The scene on the beach at the end is the best, it makes me cry every time!Make sure you own it!	10
 Quite simply the best movie I have ever seen	"I have seen many movies in my day and none top The Shawshank Redemption. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman are spectacular.  The story is told from a narration given by Freeman who plays the character ""Red"", a prisoner who befriends Tim Robins character Andy Dufrain.  It is a tremendous story of human triumph.  As the movie rises to an incredible climax you will find yourself pumping your fist in the air in delight. This is a movie I never get tired of watching again and again and each time I feel delighted.  A true masterpiece!"	10
 A masterpiece, shame it was put down by Hollywood politix...		10
 It's more than a movie, it's a management style.	One of the best movies made. It also provides a beautiful analogy for a common (mis)management practice.  See this movie and put your job in perspective. We are all Andy, being used by our bosses to advance themselves, shown off to their friends, etc. but never really given any actual credit, and held in place by those same bosses, lest they lose the status that keeping us under them provides...Or you can just see it because it's good. Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is great.	10
 A case for banning trailers, posters, and media		10
 The best cinematic way of storytelling		10
 The perfect movie		10
 Quite good, really	<<WARNING: EXTREME SPOILERS>>I won't argue that this is a really good film. It is. But I've always felt it's been built up a bit too much. It's well-structured, well-paced, and Morgan Freeman gives a brilliant performance, along with all of his co-stars. But it's still something of a modern fairy tale. We never doubt that things will turn out all right in the end for Andy and Red, or that Norton will get his comeuppance. This, combined with a tendency to get cloying, particularly with the opera record and the spunky kid, effectively knocks it out of the running as one of the all-time greats.All this aside, however, it's impact can't be denied either. Frank Darabont may have let his sentimentality go raging out of control on The Green Mile next, but he just enough restraint here to move us almost to tears. And this same emotional black-and-white treatment allows plot points that might have been laughed of in a more cynical film to feel perfectly satisfying. Tell me you didn't raise a fist in triumph when Norton blew his brains out. And regarding sentiment, it certainly wasn't 1994's worst offender. Matching Forrest Gump for saccharine value would tax even Darabont's skills.	6
 Greatest movie ever made!	I loved every moment and line from this this movie  right from the opening scene to the end credits.the movie is about andy dufresne a man convicted of murder who is put in shawshank state prison.He strikes up a friendship with the prison fixer red.After having a rough time in the prison he manages to make it in prison becoming very successful with the library and with the guards and the warden.There is the an arrival of a new inmate  which turns the plot right around,leading up to the greatest ending ever seen in a movie.i highly recommend seing this movie,in fact go see it right now!. I promise you will love it(im not lying!).thankyou, now go watch it!.	10
 I can't believe it...		10
 FEEL THIS FILM		
 Absolutely perfect		10
 Stephen King's Redemption	I am neither a Stephen King nor a prison movie fan, so had not bothered to watch this film until recently... That was my loss. Shawshank Redemption, like all great movies, falls into no category. It defines its own space. It is an incredible story woven across time and between two characters. It is about Spirit and Justice. And friendship.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins should have shared Best Actor Oscars for this film. I hate to admit it, but Stephen King has talent.	
 The essence of hope	I have seen this movie like a thousand times, and I enjoyed it every single time, because every single time watching it, I remarked new anecdotes that I hadn't in the previous watching. Morgan Freeman is definitely on his best performance ever,(I just love the part where he sits in front of the rehabilitation committee for the last time and tells them how it feels to be in prison for more than 20 years), and Frank Darabont can surely be proud of directing an intelligent movie, but Tim Robbins deserves to be mentioned due to an excellent performance as well as all the other actors. I appreciate the way in which this movie combines two crucial topics of every life: Hope and disillusion ! And I guess I also liked it because there aren't any women in the movie! No offence!	
 very aspiring movie	one that will stay at the top of my list for a very very long time. i've watched this movie ever and over again and i still am amazed by how good the movie is. it's a very enlightening movie that will make you think about many things about your life and what have you done in live. i guess every one of you have watched this excellent peace of art, so i guess you have the same feeling as i have right now. too bad this awesome movie do not enter my country in indonesia, so not many people can appreciate the sheer quality of shawshank redemption.a very touching movie indeed.	10

 A Modern Masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption is the type of film which has divided its audience into two categories: those who loved it, and those who don't care for it. There is rarely anything between.  Flawless acting, passionate direction, and a memorable score have made the film a powerful cinematic experience, and at times, it can be thought provoking.  It never lacks in pace, there is always a steady rhythm to the film.  The Shawshank Redemption is a modern masterpiece.Rating: 10	9
 some places with no memory	It is one of the most fantastic films I have ever seen. Thanks to a colleague of my company, she introduced it to me. Actually, I have noticed the film for a long time in video&audio shops in my city. But maybe the cover and the translation of the movie's name are not attractive, it didn't catch my attention. I saw it in a cold winter afternoon. And when the film ended, I thanked GOD for taking me such a good film to me. Tim Robbins and Freeman, from then on, became my most favorite actors. The end of the film is make me moved. It may the best end for the audience and Andy and Red. Somewhere you have no memory, in paradise maybe. I wish I could take time there someday.	
 Yet another brilliant masterpiece from King and Durabont.	This ranks right up with my favorite movies of all time.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give excellent performances in this movie.  It kind of annoys me that this movie won no award.  It should have swept the Oscars and the Academy Awards.  Still this movie should be seen again and again.  It is one of those movies that just won't get tiring and maybe it might just attract fans in the new century.  I give it a ten out of ten!Trust me go see this movie!!!!	
 So far the best American film I have ever seen.	This movie is so far the best American film I have ever seen. I am surprised it didn't receive the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director. The story is touching and the actors delivered excellent performance. It captured the subtle human emotions one expressed when he faced a sudden traumatic misfortune in life and demonstrated how he kept hope and faith when he spent years of difficult life in prison. It also has a good portrait of true friendship between the two main characters in the movie (Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman). I am sure I will own a DVD for this film and will watch it again and again over the years as every time I watched it, it reminded me of the courage, hope and faith one should have when faced with obstacles in life. I can't say enough good thing about this film. If you haven't watched it yet, I highly highly recommend it and you won't be disappointed.	10
 Great Film	A great film. Period. Those of you who haven't watched it yet, make sure to do so. Don't listen to those who say it isn't a great movie - obviously most of the rest of the world does think it was an absolute great movie. Watch it and judge for yourselves.	10
 One of my five favourite movies of all time.	"The Shawshank Redemption is one of the wisest and most touching films I have ever seen.  It tells the tale of the friendship between two convicted murderers: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). Many things make this a good film: its genuine depiction of prison life, the wonderful performances from Robbins and Freeman, the great music from Thomas Newman.  For all of these qualities, The Shawshank Redemption is worth seeing.What makes the film great for me, though, is the way that in its depiction of prison life, the film becomes an existential display of how most of us live our own lives.  ***SPOILER AHEAD***  Throughout the film, we are confronted by how people choose to accept their freedom.  Brooks, the old librarian, who has been in prison for almost his entire life, becomes scared of the freedom he enjoys, and can not take it.  The same fate almost befalls Red, but his redemption comes as he is able to accept the unpredictability of his life, and draw inspiration from Andy.  The film rings absolutely true, I know many people who are too afraid to chase after their own dreams, and would rather stay in a mundane yet predictable and secure job.  ""Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine,"" Red says in the course of the film.  So, I imagine, do many people's lives.  The Shawshank Redemption is about breaking away from the routine, taking risks, and going after your dreams without compromise."	10
 ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME	The movie was filled with inspiration and hope.  Great script and acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freemen.  I can never get tired of watching this amazing film.  An amazing well written screen play and camera shots too. I recommend everybody to see this film!	10
 Truly a Masterpiece		10
 Brilliance of Stephen King visualized by Frank Darabont	The Shawshank redemption is simply excellent! a story that goes right to your heart and goes really deep in to the soul, and it shows us that hope does matter, without hope, we have nothing to go for.Wonderful acting by the modern legend Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins the story is brilliantly told, and the movies should be one second shorter and not one second longer, Stephen King and Frank Darabont really knows what to do to keep the story fresh all the way!you should definitly get this movie!!	10
 The Best Film Ever	Simply the best film I've ever seen.  Inspiring, uplifting, well acted, and beautifully filmed.  It is a crime that Forrest Gump was even considered for best picture the same year this film was out.	10
 Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins great collaboration.	"Shawshank is a story about a man who is wrongly convicted for the murder of his wife and her lover.  He finds himself in the pits of hell or what is commonly known as Shawshank Prison.  There he learns about the power of truth and friendship as he changes the hearts of those he knows and lives with.  This story is not about the problems of our justice or prison systems and the horrors that prisoners face, not only from their fellow inmates but also from those there to ""manage"" them; rather this story relays the close bond that people form in tough situations and how our will to survive is not just about whether or not we live but how we live.  To quote William Wallace from Braveheart, ""every man dies not every man lives.""  This is the story about choosing to live and live with dignity and friendship in the face of all hardships.  Highly Recommended"	10
 Just a few quick notes	"I think most of what I think about this movie has already been said in a number of positive and negative reviews already available for reference.  It certainly is what I would classify as a great movie, but since I haven't seen as many films as I would like, I'm not sure whether it would be appropriate for me to call it a ""best of all time"".You know when you see the end of a movie and it leaves you so shocked it takes your breath away(think ""Sixth Sense"")?  Let me put it this way:  have the Resolve carpet cleaner handy, for you will be dropping drinks throughout the movie.  It surprises you at every turn.I'm not a movie reviewer, and all I know is how I reacted to seeing it the first few times.  My family couldn't watch it with me, as my constant ""Oh my God!""'s annoyed them.Just take my work for it and see it.  It can't hurt you."	
 Brilliant Masterpiece		10
 Possibly the best movie of the 20th Century....	This movie has everything - hope and dreams, twists and humor, horror and happiness, success and failure. It is so many stories to so many people. I have seen all but the first 10 minutes 100 times, since every time I am surfing the cable channels and see it I stop and watch it, usually until the end. A fantastic story.	10
 The best movie ever made.	Superb acting and dialogue paint this moving tale of hope and friendship. With beautiful cinematography, complex characters, and witty yet poetic dialogue, the Shawshank Redemption is movie art at its finest. I find myself so enraptured by it, that I am unable to leave until the movie is complete... and I've seen it about 100 times. This is not a movie to watch while doing something else.	10
 Great, awesome!!!	The Shawshank Redemption is the best film i have ever seen. The story by itself is just awesome, and the actors in this film are really superb It is not right that the godfather stands before this film.Shawshank Redemption should be at first place!!!!	10
 NOT THAT GREAT!!! OPEN YOUR FRIGGIN EYES!!!!!!		
 A breathtaking film	Words are far too poor to embrace the magic of this film. This movie along with the brilliance of Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and the plot twists and spirit created by the master Stephen King is a masterpiece. I have never felt such a mixture of emotions from one film. And this film certainly delivers the kind of electricity that touches one's soul.	10
 A Masterpiece!!!!	This is simply the definitive American film about the endurance of the human spirit.A wrongly convicted man spends twenty years in a brutal prison, never losing his hope for freedom. A beautifully written and directed film by frank Darabont.A true representation of what the art of film can be elevated to. One of the greatest films ever made.	10
 Perfect in every sense...		10
 Absolutely brillant.	Sometimes, when you see a film, it touches you in such a way that you find it difficult to describe. 'Shawshank Redemption', is one such film. Everything is just class. Freeman should have had an Oscar for his performance as 'Red', and I find it amazing that 'Gump' beat it to best film. Don't get me wrong, 'Gump' is a good film, but in my humble opinion the only film that can come close to this is 'the Godfather'. The ending to the film is just incredible, one of the few times that I have ever almost cried during a film. I won't give anymore away about the film. Just go and see it.NOW.I mean turn off your computer and get a video or DVD of it by any means possible. I agree that this is one of the GREATEST films ever.	10
 4 Stars	"Excellent, powerful drama about two mens' friendship and escape from Shawshank prison.  Robbins and Freeman excel in perfect roles.  Sharp script and touching subplots add to this enduring film.  Freeman's narration illuminates beauty and power of Stephen King short story upon which it is based.  Directed by Frank Darabont (""The Green Mile"")."	7
 I'm gob-smacked!!!	"I had never heard of this movie.I missed it when it came out in theatres.But fortunately it was my destiny not to miss it.It is amazing!It has absolutely no ""leaks"",no parts in the plotline where you say ""hey,something's wrong here"".Freeman and Robbins give an excellent performance. It is one of the very few Hollywood movies I've seen,which actually contains large quantities of drama and feeling.Don't miss this movie,cause if you do you've lost one of the best experiences of your life"	10
 Theme of the movie.	This movie is a great example of how a person can be wrongly convicted in today's legal justice system.  The movie also shows how someone's patience and determination can lead to their success in the future.  The movie is a great drama and one of the best movies I have ever seen!	10
 15 minutes short, or actually long of perfect.	Hard to believe that Tim Robbins could be so good in such a serious role. As usual, Freeman is fantastic and the supporting cast was effective. The only imperfection to this great film is that it runs about 15 minutes too long. Not to say that the last several scenes were unnecessary, but certainly dragged, after the climax of the film had been achieved. Nonetheless, a great movie with a brilliant twist.	9
 gives me shudders	SPOILER ALERT This movie--as I just watched it for, say, the 100th time this morning--is just incredible.  It gives me shudders everytime I watch it.  My favorite part is when the jerk realizes how tim robbins gets out.  What mastery!  I then felt true shudders when he scrambles out of the sewage pipe and rips off his shirt.  I can only imagine being thrown in jail, innocently, spending years there, and not only to be set free but get back at the jerk, and have money at the end.  The movie is thought-provoking and intense from beginning to end.  I love Morgan Freeman too.  The movie taught me many lessons, and reminded me that the simple flight of a bird and the blue of an ocean is something not to take for granted.  Freedom is definitely my biggest priority.	10
 SIMPLY EXCELLENT!	i read novels ...a lot..& i have never come across a movie (based on a novel)which could even equal the book version ...that is...until this movie came along. My God! what a movie..i dare even say that it was better than the book...novellette actually.Hats off to the movie makers. Andy is a classic case of 'never judge a book by it's color'. Morgan freeman in his best ever role...he can really play those all-knowing-incharge types. When i got to know how Andy escaped,...it was the shocker of a life time.Not even in my wildest dreams could i have done what Andy had done to escape. The warden was thoroughly chilling with his alum effected mouth. 'the sisters' were a real good throw-in...spice to the brew. A thoroughly enjoyable movie with more turns than a twister. Watch this one first, then watch something else.	10
 Unbelievable performance by Tim Robbins	What a fantastic movie!  Tim Robbins gave the best performance I have ever seen by an actor and Morgan Freeman was excellent, also.  There are some unbelievably moving scenes in this film. I foolishly passed it by at the theater and at the video store.  When I saw it on cable for the first time, I realized it was a truly special movie.  Why?  I could not put my finger on it until I read the summary on the video box in the store.  It really is a triumph of the human spirt with a tremendously satisfying ending.  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen and it will be added to my collection this Christmas!	10
 one of the five best films ever made. Four Stars ****	This masterpiece belongs in the company of The Godfather, and other films often mentioned reverently as the best of all time. I am not going to compare this film to the other finest made, as that is often difficult to do, how does one quantify what is the best, without shortchanging other films. Simply put, this is a timeless story, which encompasses the best elements of all films, suspense, horror, comedy, tragedy, and puts them together in a seamless tapestry, as rich and colorful as life itself. Superlatives fail to illustrate the quality of this work, as complete and satisfying a film that has ever been made.	10
 one of the best films i've ever seen!		10
 a film to treasure		10
 Beautiful, absolutely Beautiful!!	This movie is the bomb!!  Great Movie!!  I don't have enough thumbs to recommend the Shawshank!!  Great actors in a great story.  This is a great movie to sit back with your girlfriend and just chill out.  It's just superb.  A must have in anyone's video collection!!	9
 One of the best films ever	There's not much left to say about this film. Saw it last night for about the fifth time and I am still as impressed as I was seeing it the first time in cinema. Intelligent, moving, funny, and sad, this movie is just perfect. Freeman and Robbins are brilliant, so are the supporting characters. Too bad that there are not many more films like this one. A must see for everyone!	10
 AN EXCELLENT STORY OF ONE MAN'S HOPE FOR FREEDOM	"I HAVE NOT SEEN MANY FILMS ABOUT PRISON LIFE. I KNOW WHAT I HAVE SEEN FROM TELEVISION (REMEMBER THOSE TV SPECIALS ""SCARED STRAIGHT""?), MAGAZINES, ETC. THEY ALL HAVE ONE SIMPLE THEME: PRISON IS ""HELL"" - AND THOSE WHO HAVE COMMITTED A CRIME, FOR WHATEVER REASON, DESERVE THEIR STAY IN ""HELL"".  SOME PEOPLE GO TO PRISON FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS IN THE WORLD AS WELL - SOME ARE UNJUSTLY SENTENCED FOR CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT.  THIS IS THE STORY OF ANDY DUFRESNE - A MAN WHO WENT TO SHAWSHANK PRISON FOR ALL THOSE WRONG REASONS.  ALSO, IT EXPLORES ANDY'S FRIENDSHIP WITH ELLIS BOYD ""RED"" REDDING - A MAN WHO WENT TO PRISON FOR A CRIME HE COMMITTED. IT'S A STORY OF HOPE IN THE MIDST OF ""HELL"".  A MUST SEE FILM.  EXCELLENTLY DIRECTED BY FRANK DARABONT."	
 There is not a single human emotion that this film does not bring out.		8
 One of the best films ever made and the most underrated film ever	This movie is simply amazing. The acting is superb, especially from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the direction is one of kind and the ending sequence is so touching that you will cry.This film should have get more attention. Can't understand why it didn't...	10
 Of the thousands of movies I've seen this one is hands down the best!	After seeing this movie again there isn't any words that I can think of to adequately describe what a truly great movie the Shawshank Redemption represents.  Every human emotion was perfectly portrayed right down to the coldness of the Shawshank's concrete and steel.  This is Morgan Freeman's best movie to date and likely Tim Robbins best movie ever.  The cast's acting job is top notch.  The period and setting, perfect. Thomas Newman's music score, perfect.  Supporting cast, perfect.  I think that this is the only movie that I can not think of one single thing that would improve it. Nothing.  Owning this movie would be the crown jewel in anyone's collection.If you haven't seen this movie stop reading this now and go to the nearest video rental place, rent this movie, and come home and spend the best 2+ hours you will ever spend watching a movie. Really!  Stephen King is King. I can't understand what this movie is only #2 on IMDB and not #1.	10
 Number 1 Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is a great movie that has kept my attention from the first to the one hundredth time that I have watched it.  This was the first movie I had ever seen Tim Robbins in and I have like him ever since. Not too often can I watch a movie over and over again, but this one does it for me.  It is a very powerful movie with many touching parts.  Great movie overall...if you have never seen it before, I highly recommend it.	10
 A very touching and wonderfully told story	A marvelous film that reaches in and touches your heart like no other movie has done before. After I watched this movie I was so moved by it that I sat there and stared at the screen after the credits rolled up. That is how excellent this movie is. This is a movie that everyone in the universe should see. An absolutely incredible film. An easy 10/10	10
" ""I hope..."""	"...that if you've never seen this movie, that you'll take the time to watch.Even if it's from the beginning, the middle or the last 20 minutes. I watch this movie when it's on TV. Morgan Freeman is one of the finest actors in America, and his portrayal of Red's journey of friendship and to freedom is touching. His words, ""get busy living or get busy dying,"" never fail to hit home.  It's just a good story that Frank Darabont turned into an excellent movie. The performances are all good - Freeman deserved an Oscar. Absolutely one of the best movies ever."	10
 Not the greatest, but too good to miss		9
 Indescribable	Anyone who has seen this film will understand why I cannot justify with words.Anyone who has not seen it; I feel sorry for you.10/10	10
 One of the top two films ever made	"This film didn't win the Best Picture Oscar?  It would have been under-appreciated even if it had won, an Oscar isn't worthy enough to be associated with this amazing film.  They should have created a separate award for this movie--""The Best Film Ever"" award."	9
 Touching Story	I must say this is one of the most touching movies I have ever seen - and without a doubt one of the best. Although it doesn't resemble the usual Stephen King writings, it helps to show his diverse talent as a writer.	10
 a woman's point of view	"To say that The Shawshank Redemption is an exquisite piece of film-work doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of how this film can and will affect those that choose to view it.  Yes, some points are brought violently to the surface, yet throughout Shawshank, there is a subtlety to the relationships between all of the characters, not just the lead roles.  I have read a copy of the original screenplay, and although many ""adjustments"" were made by Frank Darabont, I honestly believe that absolutely nothing could be added or even taken away to improve this work in any way.  And as strange as it may seem to my friends who ask, yes, being a woman, The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite film of all time.  And yes, ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things..."""	10
 The only perfect movie ever made.	This movie is absolutely perfect.  If you have not yet seen it, you must get up from the computer and rush to the video store NOW.  It is a wonderfully crafted tale of hope and the human spirit.  I love this movie, and consider it the #1 movie of all time.  I feel sorry for you if you have not yet seen it.	10
 You won't be disappointed	I'm a big King fan and I loved the book.  This is the best screenplay of King's work in my opinion. Brilliant cast and acting. Exceptional story from one of the great writers of our time.	
 Maybe the greatest and best made movie of all time		10
 The Best Of The 90's		10
 The #1		9
 Great Film, GREAT Music	This film is an absolute beauty, but no-one seems to have picked up on the music. It's a fantastically atmospheric and sparsely written piano/strings score by Thomas Newman, and does exactly what a good film score should do: enhances the atmosphere 110 percent without ever intruding on, or detracting from, the visuals. Quality stuff!	
 a grand escape and passion drama....	well...what can i say about that movie...it's just a dramatic galore..it takes you in a side..and then pull you the hell from the other side..i think morgan freeman was great...i liked him much here:))) also the music was great..it is really a 10/10 movie..	10
 It's a crime this film didn't sweep the oscars.		10
 uplifting, wonderfully acted	"I missed this when it came out, and probably wouldn't have gone even if I had heard about it. I expected this to be what ""The Green Mile"" was. That is, I thought it would be heavy-handed, pretentious, self-consciously high-minded, and boring. It is anything but these. It's an engrossing story and very entertaining story of two men and how they overcome their past lives. Freeman and Robbins give wonderful performances, and the supporting cast measures up. There are plenty of funny moments in the film, and the ending is intensely satisfying. It is a great movie."	9
 The Tops/The Best Ever!	This movie is uplifting and it is amazing and there are so many adjectives I could use to describe it so I won't waste your time...Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are amazing and the story is amazing, considering that I'm not a fan of King's works...I rated this a 10/10 for that wonderful film...	10
 An almost perfect film	"It's fun to watch this movie a second time and pick up some things you never noticed the first time. So many things simply went unnoticed (Andy writing into the wall, his little geology tool, the ""sex symbols throughout the decades"" posters) and suddenly wind together to grab our attention and make this a wonderful movie. The film was fascinating in the fact that it showed us how ""lifers"" could only witness the change of culture in the outside world by observing the prisoners that come and go over the years, and this being the only glimpse on how the world is changing, they become institutionalized, and actually fear their freedom. I actually found myself feeling sorry for murderers, and I debated with myself on whether or not they should be released if they truly become rehabilitated. The determination and hope transpired by Andy brought our hopes up: Most movies bring our hopes up only to bring them down, but when we see him running through the pond and standing in the rain with his arms raised and the great music accompanying the scene, our hopes our fulfilled. This is one of only about three or four films that had great smarts and left me completely satisfied. 10/10."	
 The most inspire movie about human determination		9
 Exquisite Cinema		10
 An excellent piece of story telling!		
 MOST UNDER APPRECIATED FILM EVER	This film's high ranking on IMDB is both a testimony to its greatness and a spotlight on how embarrassingly out of touch the Oscar Academy is.Congratulations to all of those involved in making one of the truly greatest films of all time.	10
 My #1		10
 Best movie of all time!!	"This movie has to be the most electrifing movies of all time.  This short story (originally written by Stephen King) gives a heart pounding reality of an innocent banker who uses hope, courage, and brains to OUTsmart the pison walls of Shawshank.    Morgan Freeman plays an exceptional character (Red) who claims that being ""institutionalized"" can keep a man from being truly free.  This movie displays one of the best one-liners I have ever heard and the best ending life has to offer-(if you listen close to what Red has to say he fore shadows Andy's greatest stunt.) I enjoyed SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and I enjoy IMDB, they display all the memorable quotes that I enjoyed and I gave this movie a Rating of 10!!"	10
 YES; YES, YES	One of the greatest movie I've seen. It tuched me deep in my heart. Absolutely brilliant.Congratulations King.	10
 A good and entertaining movie	The Shawshank Redemption made me spend a good evening when I watched it. Though quiet common, the plot has a good rythm. The beginning of the movie is even very common, with the scene of a murder and the following trial. The story in the prison goes rather slowly. The actors are good, especially Morgan Freeman. It is a good entertainment, but nothing more.	7
 Brilliant! The greatest drama since Citizen Kane!	Shawshank Redemption is one of the greatest flicks I have ever seen. Morgan freeman and Tim Robbins put on an award-winning performance.  I think this film would have received more Academy Awards if the subject matter had not been so dark and it had not been facing Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. I watch this film time and time again and still have the same anxiety of the first time.  I have ruined three video tapes of the Shawshank Redemption by excessive viewing.  Each purchase of a new tape is worth it!	10
 The most brilliant movie	This is what it's all about! The creation of a movie that will move us all. A great story, great actors, great filming, but most of all:A superb plot. Absolutly superb.	10
 In my top 10	Just saw this for the first time on TV and I will definitely get a DVD copy for watching again and again.  A really great movie! I was mesmerized by Freeman and Robbins acting ability.  I felt like they were my personal friends by the end of the movie.  I could relate to their inner thoughts and deeds.	10
 One of the best	I saw this movie for the first time a year and a half ago.  I liked it, but I didn't remember how much until it was on TV today.  Everything comes together so well at the end, and on repeated viewing, there is a whole new level to it.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both exceptional in their roles.  Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a convicted murderer who goes to Shawshank Prison where he is befriended by Red (Morgan Freeman), who has already served 20 years there.  Despite the hardships of prison, Andy refuses to lose hope, and he tries to inspire Red to feel as he does.I can't think of one scene that was wasted.  Everything helped build to the movie's conclusion.  Every character was important, as was every line of dialogue.I actually cried at the end.  This movie really makes you think and touches your heart.  Next to Pulp Fiction, the best movie of the 90's.	
 An absolutely brilliant adaptation.	The Shawshank redemption is one of a very few movies that lives up to the book it is based upon. Many Stephen King books become almost unrecognizable on the screen, but this one, like 'The Green Mile', stays true to the feel and rhythm of the book. Every time I watch it, I appreciate it more. One of the best.	10
 GREAT!!!!!!	"I want to say that this film is one of the best ever:THE REASON IS SIMPLE...........................ACTING IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!! Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are simply the BEST!!!!!!AS FOR FORREST GUMP.......................DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT IT WAS BETTER THAN THE ""SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION""??????NO WAYYYYYYYYYY! FORREST GUMP IS A SIMPLE FRAUD!!!!!!!!TOM HANKS IS AWFUL,AND SO IS THE ENTIRE FILM..................."	10
 Inside, we are free!		
 Better than the book.	You've heard the rule, the book is always better than the movie.  Here is the only exception I have found.  This movie is better than the book.  A great book - Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King. The movie is even better.  It could well have been named, the Shawshank Exception.	10
 One word... Brilliant.	This must be one of the movies I have enjoyed most at the cinema. I can't find one bad moment in this masterpiece. Both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman delivered their parts as if they were living them. Morgan Freeman's thought's was interesting listening too. My feeling for this film can't be expressed in words so I let the rest of the audience decide whether they like it or not. But as You already imagine, this is one of my favorites. 10 out of 10A must see......................	10
 It doesn't get much better than this.		10
 The Best	I have no clever thoughts or ideas about this movie.  I am not going to discuss the plot, acting, or directing.  It is just the best movie I have ever seen.  Period.  End of story.  See ya.  .	10
 breath-taking	The Shawshank Redemption was a beautifully directed movie. The actors portrayed their characters to the greatest extent and i thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The best scene in the movie was the huge tree...each of its branches catching the suns rays as Morgan Freeman finds what Tim Robbins left for him...anyone who doesn't remember that better watch the movie again.	10
 brilliant	This film is based on Stephen King's story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. It was part of a collection of four short novels, among them Apt Pupil (adapted by Bryan Singer) and The Body (made into Stand By Me by Rob Reiner). Shawshank was a great story and the film adaption by Frank Darabont is brilliant. The film is highlighted by the strong performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.This movie has everything you could want in a film: inspiring story of people persevering through bad times, strong directing and acting (two of the very best actors of today) and one of the classic endings I've seen in a movie.Shawshank is well-made and inspiring. It has joined my personal movie hall-of-fame, which includes The Grapes of Wrath, High Noon, Goodfellas, L.A. Confidential and Bugsy. I also reccomend The Green Mile, Darabont's most recent King adaption.	10
 This movie was brilliant!	I really enjoyed this movie. There was obviously a lot of thought put into the script and it delivers brilliantly. The directing is also wonderful, and the actors fit the part perfectly. This is a gruesome account of prison life in the 1950's-60's that is very violent, although this was necessary in the film. A very good movie, and a must-see!	10
 The best	In my book this is the best movie ever made, or at least my favorite.  I know that may be going out on a limb, but it is that spectacular.  It makes me smile every time in the end, it actually brings me near tears which very few movies have ever done.	10
 By far the easiest movie to watch over and over again!	Arguably Tim Robbins' greatest performance to date.  Coming from someone who tends to appreciate movies set behind bars, this movie is every bit worth 10 stars!  I was astonished to find out that this is adapted from a great Stephen King short story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.Before writing this review, I sat down, with a bowl of popcorn and a cold one (Pepsi), and watched this great movie again.  It has come to my opinion that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, or the way it was put together. Everyone prisoner should be allowed to watch this movie, and hope that their warden would allow them to keep after the books, and then use that position to break out.  But, after all, this is Hollywood!	10
 Greatest movie ever	This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life the acting and story are superb. If you have not seen this movie go see it RIGHT NOW! This movie has wone 7 Oscars I think and it deserves ever one of them.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are a great team together	10
 Superb	This simply is the best movie I've ever seen. With 2 of the greatest actors (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) and such a great ending, it will be difficult to beat (in my case). This movie will be the standard for 'jail-movies' for a very long time!	10
 Wonderful	This movie was a little overrated, but it was still wonderful.  What can I say that hasn't already been said.  It was a lot like the Green Mile, only it has some more interesting plot twists and such.  It had a great ending. It deserved to be nominated for Best Picture, and I enjoyed it more than Forrest Gump (which, I think won that year), but I think Pulp Fiction should have won that year.	
 powerful, but could have been less intense	There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very powerful and important motion picture.  But, due to the R rating, there are certain situations that are somewhat shocking in nature.  A few cuts might have helped move the story along, too.  Otherwise, an ok film.	
 Simply perfect.	I was so surprised and glad to see this movie as high as it is on this site's list.  It is one of my favorite movies and so many people missed out on it because of GUMP, which I personally feel is an inferior movie.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give incredibly moving and restrained performances that moved me to tears more than once. The direction and timing were flawless, and the story itself inspirational. It is so nice to see a Stephen King movie done right for once.This is simply a wonderful movie, worth watching over and over again.	10
 Hands down the Greatest Movie ever made		10
 Number 1 ?	Someone please tell me why this film is number two when it has a 9.0 user rating. Perhaps the mafia has an insider here to keep the Godfather number 1. Anyway this film deserves to be number 1 for so many reasons. Just see it and you will know why.	10
 Beauty	A beautiful film.  I must have seen it twenty times.  No joke.  Thomas Newman's haunting musical score still touches me with every viewing.  This is one of those films that plays on TV almost constantly and yet you still find yourself watching it every time.  I guess its because of its epic scale and like a great painting you can find some new in it each time you view it.Frank Darabont does a great adaptation of Stephen King's novella from his 'Different Seasons' collection.  I guess the theme of each novella in the book relates to the different seasons.  The quote 'hope springs eternal' is at the preface of the Shawshank section of the book and if you've seen the film you know hope is the movie's central theme.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins make a great pair in this, probably the best on screen pair since Redford and Newman.  See this film and you may become a Shawshank fanatic like so many other people.	
 Gets better every time I watch it		10
 I really, really like it		
 Almost perfect...	"...movie and like another of my favorites, ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" one that I could see over and over again and still find something new to appreciate. This is a jewel of a movie and one that I'm sorry didn't receive the recognition it so richly deserved. James Whitmore should at least have been nominated for Best Supporting Actor; that he didn't is a disgrace. Morgan Freeman gives his usual awesome performance. Rent this movie! Then a few months later, rent it again. This movie is so poignant and says so much about friendship and hope that I defy anyone not to be moved by it."	
 A lesson in film making!	If more people would watch the Shawshank Redemption before putting on a film maker hat and providing the public with the crud that's out there, I am convinced that the world would be a much better place! This film is just simply UNREAL! Great job all around and no wonder it's in the top 5 of the IMDB's all time best 100.	
 An inspirational reflection of life's own tribulations	"This and Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" rank side by side at the summit of my all-time favorites list (and no, I am not a Morgan Freeman freak).This is the kind of movie that starts out solid and keeps driving at you...solid. It does not make any insultingly wrongful turns in logic nor does it infringe on your conception of what is believable and what is excruciatingly unbelievable.This is a no-frills story of a man who is wrongfully accused of murdering his wife. The film's glorious irony, that his 19-years-long jail sentence is the best thing to happen to him in his life, slowly manifests itself."	10
 A spectacular debut unfortunately followed by a lackluster sophomore effort	"After being slightly dissappointed by ""The Green Mile"", I decided to check out Frank Darabont's first adaptation of a Steven King prison story once again. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" remained as much of an enjoyably original modern classic after this second viewing. In this second viewing, I appreciated even more the sparklingly sharp dialogue between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. Like in ""Green Mile"", Darabont set the scene of a depression-era prison extremely well. The director was also well-served to use King's vivid character descriptions to make the supporting characters as memorable as the leads. The result was an instant, uplifting classic about hope brought to the most hopeless locations."	10
 Well deserving of it's number 2 IMDb ranking!	"I do not normally consider myself to be much of a drama fan, having always preferred the action-adventure genre. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the film that changed that feeling for me, and reading the other comments and reviews, for a lot of other people as well.  Frank Darabont made a giant leap forward from his previous efforts in the ""B"" horror film world when he came up with this gem.  Tim Robbins turned in his best performance as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman was brilliantly cast as Red.  This is a ""Feel-Good"" movie of the first order, and well worth it's number 2 ranking on the IMDb top 250.  Everything works in this film, the score, the acting, the realism of the prison scenes, absolutely  everything!  ""Shawshank"" is as close to a perfect film as you will ever see.  If you do not already own a copy of this masterpiece, run, do not walk, to the video store and purchase a copy.  It should be in the library of every movie fan.  A 5 star, 10 out of 10, classic movie!!"	10
 man!!	this is the greatest movie i have ever seen.  by reading the plot you may think of it as just another prison movie. it's more of a friends movie. the greatest portrayal of how wonderful a friend is i have ever seen.  i love this movie and have seen it a million times and will see it another million times.	10
 Best Prison Movie Ever? Heck, Best Movie Ever. Period.	"Okay, I will not reiterate what praises others have said about this movie. I think it's brilliant and touching, and others have expressed this more eloquently than I can. See for yourself.  I just wish IMDB had a 1 to 100 scale for rating movies, instead of 1 to 10. Then I could give this movie a perfect 100, while giving something like ""Cinema Paradiso"" a 94 or 95. As it stands, I gave both movies a ten, but I think Shawshank is a shade better, and I wish a new ratings could reflect that opinion."	10
 Inspiring, fulfilling; the best movie I've ever seen	For me, the best movies inspire emotion.  This movies does just that for me, better than any other movie to date.The message here is one of mostly one of hope with a dash of justice thrown in.  There is hope for the unjustly incarcerated, and justice for those who do wrong.  Andy DeFresne, despite all the odds against him, never lets the situation get to him. Red finds his hope through Andy.The onscreen performances are superb. Every character has dimension and adds to the message.  The screenplay, the most important component of any movie, is simply flawless.	10
 The Greatest Film Ever? Could Be.		10
 9, not 10		9
 Simply The Best?	I have many films that I regard as my personal favourites and it is difficult to put these in any order.  However the number one in my list is easy - The Shawshank Redemption. This film has addictive qualities - if this film is on a screen you have to watch it no matter how often you've seen it. I think I'll go and watch it again now!	10
 If ever a film deserved a bag of Oscars, this is it!		10
 well done prison film	An intelligent, resourceful man survives in a brutal prison during the 1950's and 60's. Emphasis on character development rather than enviroment place this film ahead of others in this genre.  A fine example of the triumph-of-human-spirit-over-adversity theme. (Rating: A)	
 Great and beautiful	"This film is so beautiful and so touching I had problems seeing it without crying. Who knew Stephen King could write like this and the first film of Frank Darabont(later he directed The Green Mile)was to be one of the greatest films ever made. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are excellent in this movie and the way the story itself is told is pure genius.It`s a brutal and violent film ,but still it`s the most beautiful and loving film I`ve ever seen. It`s a story about friendship and hope and the road to freedom.The greatest scene in the film is when Andy and his fellow-prisoners work at the roof,and Andy is nearly killed by captain Hadley, but ends up drinking beer in the morning sun with his friends ""like free men""."	
 A human being's spirit can be the most powerful thing of all.	An all-time favorite.  I am a college professor, and have used this film in sociology, science of success, and various legal classes that I teach.  The reactions of students are almost always extremely poignant.  An inspirational prison movie.  Unbelieveable.	10
 A fantastic, powerful film.	This film is destined to become a classic. It shows the human spirit in full force. The story is terrific with many wonderful characters. Morgan Freeman delivers a truly brilliant performance that received a well-deserved Academy Award nomination. Bob Gunton gives a wonderfully villainous, intense performance as Warden Norton. Darabont's direction is solid. The climax is wonderfully uplifting. On a personal note, I thought this film slowed down at times but these sequences were essential to the plot, they just seemed to distract me. This film is definetly worth a look.	10
 Emotional Powerhouse	I remember wanting to see this movie because I saw the promotional shot of Robbins standing in the rain; I thought it was a beautiful scene.  It is a minor scene in the movie.This movie is, for lack of a better word, perfect.  Every moment holds meaning, every performance is dead on.  I have watched it more times than I can count, and it always seems new and wonderful to me.  More than any movie I have seen, it brings real emotions to the audience and brings comfort to the hopeless.Sometimes I think a great work of art is one that brings change to the audience.  This movie is transforming.	10
 This Movie Rules the World	This is the best movie ever made.  If you haven't seen it yet, stop doing whatever it is that you are doing, go to your local video store, shell out the three or four dollars to rent the videotape or DVD, go home, put some popcorn in the microwave, put the movie in, turn on your home entertainment center, sit on the couch, and WATCH THIS MOVIE.  If you have friends who haven't seen it yet, tell them to come over and watch it with you.  You will not be disappointed.  They will not be disappointed.  This is the best movie ever made.	10
 Calling it a masterpiece is an understatement	This movie is brilliant.  There is no need to go into detail about the reasons behind my saying so.  It is a film that everyone should simply take the time out to watch- to try to describe its qualities would be at best an injustice to this piece of treasure.  I have never encountered a single person who regretted watching the film, and come on lets give it some more 10s so it can beat out the godfather! (which I haven't seen so maybe once I do I'll be singing a different tune)...but regardless, this film is amazing, and not many can compare to it at all.	10
 5 out of 5 stars !!!!	This film ranks as one of my top 10 films of all time .Superb performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins , they cast this film wonderfully , From the crafty warden , to the prison guards , to all the inmates , And what a terrific ending to a superb film .This film was nominated for Best Picture but lost to Forrest Gump , had it not been for Gump , this film would have surely won Best Picture.I have watched this film 20 or so times and never get tired of it , No question it is the best Prison Film ever made ( Escape from Alcatraz close second ).	
 What can I say...	This film is, with no shadow of a doubt what so ever, the best movie that I have ever had the wonderous pleasure to view. Films like Shawshank are what allow me to love movies and to cherish wonderful stories. I can say that I'm a critical gremlin- I'm constantly attempting to find faults, flaws and plot holes in every movie i see- yes, I'm that guy who always says it was only an ok movie when you loved it- But... this one is so powerful, so beautiful, so absolutely inspiring that I couldn't care if there was a plot hole or a flaw, its just too good of a film to attack. To Hell with Forest Gump for winning over Shawshank, to Hell with Titanic, Shakespeare in garbage, The English Idiot, and Forest Dump- these movies all sucked, sucked, sucked to begin with but compared to the diamond jewel of Shawshank, they look as good as sitcoms made by Fox. So anyway, my favorite movie of all time and only one of three movies worthy of a ten rating.	8
 read the other reviews!	i really dont have any more to say - except read the other reviews - they really say it for me. In other words - this is one of the greatest movies of all time. This is an absolute masterpiece and it will be definitely a film that i will gladly show to my grandchildren in the mid-21st century - IT'S THAT GOOD... watch it and learn.....	10
 Magnificent movie...the best I've seen!	"It's a great thing when you can finally find a movie you can definitively call ""your favorite"".  This is mine.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"", based on Stephen King's short novella entitled ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"", is an excellent adaptation of said literature...I will go out and say it; I've read the story and seen the movie, and although the movie took some parts out (in the story, there were three different wardens over the course of the story, and Red was Irish, not black), it expanded the detail greatly, covering parts the novella never bothered to touch on (such as Andy getting a new set of clothes and a shiny pair of shoes from the Warden ^_^).  The characters are all detailed and alive, not once did I find a character unbelievable. And I've never EVER seen an ending so incredible.  My eyes were wide, I was chanting ""Oh My God"" over and over...This movie makes you feel good all over and gives you a new perspective on life and freedom. This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.  The only fault I find is that it came out at the time as Forrest Gump, which had a lot more advertising and thus beat this great movie out in the box office.  Had it come out a few months later, it would have been much more successful."	
 Truly unforgettable!!		9
 Brilliant Redemptive Epic	This film is truly one of the greatest of all time.  Much like the other works based on Stephen King novels, there is a main storyline to follow, and then another deeper story.Morgan Freeman does a very impressive job portraying a man who has been held prisoner by his own fear of the outside world, and who is eventually freed by hope.  Tim Robbins also did an excellent job, but Frank Darabont really deserves a lot of credit for fleshing out this beautifully written script into a great movie.This is a movie that warrants multiple viewings.  Four stars!	10
 The Most Worthy of All Movies!	This was one of the very first movies that got me choked up.  I first saw it on a Pay television network, then decided that I had to have it.  To think that such a worthy film in all categories (Acting, Directing, Etc.) did not receive not one Oscar.  Yes! I was p***ed off as well.  It was much better that Forrest Gump, but hey I don't decide what wins and what doesn't. This is a definite movie for everyone!	
 Outstanding, simply outstanding!	"All my friends had the same reaction to this movie as I did when first viewing it .. how come I never heard more about it? It was great! The acting was fantastic. The storyline flowed perfectly. The writing and editing couldn't have been better.  Clearly, if not pitted against ""Forrest Gump"", ""Little Women"", ""Nell"", ""Quiz Show"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" (wow, what a line-up), I'm sure this movie would have won more awards. Morgan Freeman was great, and Tim Robbins was nothing short of amazing. If you like acting, this movie is a must!"	
 A real good movie.	I have read the short story (novella?) by Steven King and seen this great film and I have to say that this is one time when Hollywood did a better job then the author. I've seen tons of prison movies (some with good plots and others that are complete B movies) and this has to be the best one out there. Usually when I like a movie, I can watch it a bunch of times. And I have seen Shawshank many times, but none of the repeated viewings were as good as the first. Clancy Brown (he was great in Highlander too) once again steals the show as a Hard A--- prison guard who gets his just desserts in the end. Chances are you've already seen this, but if you haven't, I fully recommend you give it a chance.	10
 My Favorite Film	The Shawshank Redemption was a film that I was always on my way to the theater to see, but unfortunately, I got sidetracked each and every time. Critics felt that the long title kept people away, I guess I was in that category, no matter how great I heard this movie was. I finally saw the movie the day it hit videotape. To this day, it continues to dominate the number one position on my list of favorite films of all time. There is so much to love about this film. Especially the writing by Frank Darabont. This is one of the few films that does Stephen King's material justice. It's a very uplifting story, one that you can't really articulate with words. This film is about the experience. I'm proud to say that I own a copy of the movie, a copy of the screenplay, and a copy of Different Seasons, in which the original story derived. This is the one picture I recommend to people, even strangers, on a regular basis.	10
 A true modern day classic!	To begin with,  The story is pretty well cliched.  Like most prison dramas hope and struggle seem to be the element that put the plot together.  For once this is probably the one time that such a cliched plot actually worked. I have personally seen this movie over 20 times just to figure out how and why it works so well.  First of all the story is deep and thought provoking. Morgan Freeman's voice over narrative lets you see it through his eyes (the movie is really about him).  The acting is flawless the whole picture is shot as a true epic.  This is one great film about friendship and hope that does not dwell to much on pathos and mindless sentimentality.  A true modern day classic!	9
 A moment of Cinematic genius!	"I remember seeing The Shawshank Redemption back in '94 and thinking how absolutely out of the ordinary it was for a Hollywood picture. No soft soap ending, no moral message and no ""Whey-hey isn't America great"" that you usually get from Hollywood pics. The fact its a Steven King is remarkable to, out of his usual style, I think. It's photographed beautifully and makes no bones about the harsh reality of prison. I don't really know much about Frank Dufont but I would really like to see his other pictures based on the strength of this one."	
 The best film of all time.	It is almost impossible to glorify this movie more than it deserves because, simply I believe it is the greatest ever made. The story, characters, music are absolutely mesmerizing. The story of the never say die hope of a wrongfully convicted man sent to prison for life is awe-inspiring and poignant.  Watch this with someone you love and cherish. **** stars	
 Simple, powerful and a masterpiece	This movie is absolutely superb. You watch it and all the simple, unremarkable details just cumulate and you realise that this movie, by being unflashy and ordinary is telling a powerful story about hope and redemption. Andy seems to be the main character but it is Red who finds himself, who is redeemed.The Shawshank Redemption was overlooked because it looked unremarkable. But this movie has to be seen. My friends are action movie fanatics but they were all stunned by this movie. Stephen King should be thanked for writing the novella and the director should be praised for bringing it to the screen in such fine form. Forget Forrest Gump, this was the Best Picture of 1994.	10
 One Of The Best Movies I Have Ever Seen.	Morgan Freeman at his absolute best, Tim Robbins - better than ever - it must be a good film!!The Shawshank Redemption grabs you tight and pulls you into its depth and drama. It is definitely worth a look if you haven't seen it.This film shows the story of how hope can set you free. It is a beautiful film with excellent actors, an good story and shocking (but excellent) dialouge. The Shawshank Redemption definitely deserves it's place as my no. 5 favourite film and IMDb's no. 3 user rated film.My rating : Obviously 10/10.	10
 Fantastic Film	I happened to see this film on TV not too long ago.  My husband was watching so I thought I would sit down and watch.  I was absolutely blown away by this film  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were super!!  It was well acted well edited.  This is one of the most outstanding movies I have seen in recent years.I purchased the video and have watched numerous times.  The conclusion of this film had me on the edge of my seat.  JUST OUTSTANDING!	
 The Perfect Movie	This would have to be THE best movie that I have ever seen. The story of a wrongly convicted man. And the story of a man searching for meaning. And the story of an institutionalised man. This movie takes several different stories and turns them into one fantastic film.Watch it a number of times to see all the stories come together in an inspiring manner that touches the soul. I can't recommend this movie enough. Morgan Freeman's performance of the narrating Red, and explanations of prison life are truly touching. Tim Robbins' portrayal of Andy is near perfect, no, it IS perfect.Watch it, then watch it again.You won't be disappointed.	10
 A testament to the spirit of Hope...		
 A marvel of filmmaking...		10
 Great movie with great performances!!!	This is a story with drama, injustice, pain and real friendship. Both performances ( Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins ) were wonderful, they have made the movie even more interesting!!! No doubt, one of my favourites so far...really it is just to watching it too many times with no possibility of getting bored!!!	10
 Impressive movie about HOPE	This is a 'must see' movie. Very strong emotionally and with great actors that perform at their best.But this movie makes you think, think about life and specially about hope, and the final is well worth seeing it.After all, isn't Shawshank our prison to us all?	9
 talk about deep!! (tiny spoiler)	When it comes to analyzing the true meanings of movies I'm no expert, but this movie really gave me a feel of inner hope and confidence. I mean, put your self in Andy Dufresne's(Tim Robbins) position. If you were in prison for something that not only did you not do but was being accused of murdering someone that you loved and cared for. And you go to prison for what 30? 40 years? and day after day you dig and you dig and you dig, and with what?? a spoon!! I know I would have gone nuts by then. BUT Andy gave hope, and he also gave Red(Morgan Freeman) hope. And I think that was the main aspect of the whole movie. Which is, in no matter what type of circumstances there is always one Andy Dufresne giving hope. Go find yours!!!!I gave this movie a 8/10.	10
 My number one movie.	The movie had plot up the wazoo! The acting was superb. Robbins and Freeman were at their highest in this movie.  There were so many emotions flying through it and there was so much about the human mind.  It will leave you in awe.	10
 Sticks around in your mind a lifetime.	It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is.                              Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up. Memorable and entertaining movie with big lifts by most of the fantastic cast. And this is coming from Stephen King?                               10/10	10
 few like it	Recently, the quality of movies seems to have gone down.  There are too many action flicks and cheap comedies and not enough really good movies.  There are very few that have been made recently that are moving and contain powerful messages.  The Shawshank redemption is one.  I can honestly say that I look at many aspects of life differently because of this movie. And yet it saddens me that so many people that I know have never even seen it. I have always thought of it as under-appreciated.  It was because of seeing this movie ranked 3rd on the top 250 that I became a member of this site. It stands out as one of the best movies ever made.	
 The best movie i have ever seen	The Shawshank Redemption, is and always will be one of the greatest films ever.  Tim Robbins portrail of Andy is enough to melt the coldest heart. The secound i saw this on DVD i just had to buy it.  I give this film a rating of infinity out of 10 as it deserves it.	
 Ultimately a feelgood movie	Yeah I agree this is not a bad film. Its got a story that sucks you right in and it plays its hand very well but it really doesn't stand up too closely to scrutiny in my humble opinion. The plot is rather riddled with holes (do you really mean to tell me that after all those years in prison and the searches the prison guards never found a tunnel behind the picture....Puhleeease... How stupid are we meant to think those prison guards are)and it really is just a well-made feelgood movie. Look, I enjoyed the movie but after reading many of the comments on this website it sounded like it was directed by God Almighty and starred his only-begotten son. A bit of critical judgement please.	
 The most powerful and influential movie ever made.	No other movie like it! The greatest tragedy about this movie is that it never won an oscar! Out of 7 nominations it did'nt even pick up one. I ask what is wrong with these people?? It is very rare that a movie such as Shawshank comes along and has such an influence on the lives of many who have watched it. It touches the heart and is an inspiration for us all. What makes it such a masterpiece is its unpredictability right till the very end. In my opinion this movie should be re-released and nominated again for an Oscar.	
 A Masterpiece of Modern Film Making	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  There is so much to this story and if you blink once you'll miss something. Behind every color and object there lies a message. Watching this movie only once is an injustice. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it.	10
 Just who is the hero?		9
 One of the best prison dramas available!		10
 An Uplifting Movie About Hope	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is an uplifting movie about hope. What I got out of the movie is that as long as you have hope you will always be O.K., I felt good after watching this movie, it puts that sense of hope inside you. I was actually cheering during the scene where Andy finally escaped from prison,it was a very unique moment. This is a film that anybody can watch and anybody that does watch it it will touch them in a special way, I guarantee it."	9
 Simplicity	If you haven't seen the Shawshank Redemption by now, it's likely that you live in a cave and haven't been in touch with society for the last five years.  This is one of the best films ever made because it captivates your attention from start to finish.  I can throw it in the VCR and it doesn't matter what scene may be playing, I'm instantly engaged.  A strong story, solid acting and some glorious cinematography create a film that I cannot go more than a month without watching it.  I will likely wear the tape that the film is captured on out and I will be forced to replace that tape and I can honestly say I won't mind having to do so.	10
 Hope springs eternal for Andy Dufresne and Hollywood	"A beautiful film, finely crafted, and completely deserving of the cult status it has gained since losing the Academy Award for Best Picture (unjustly) to ""Braveheart"" in 1995. Tim Robbins will never top his performance as the wrongly-convicted Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman delivers the most effective voice-over narration in film history. I defy anyone not to be moved by the touching relationship between the two men, who grow old before our eyes as they serve out their sentences. One for history. I'll still get teary-eyed when I watch this fifteen years from now."	10
" ""watch this, for ye not know when the master of the house cometh"""	I first saw The Shawhank Redemption a year back and I was totally blown away. this film is perfect in EVERY sense, from acting to story to score,to costume to cinematography. in fact i think they should have made a new academy award, best feeling film or something.This film was clearly ripped off at the 1994 oscars. forrest gump IS a good flick i agree, but if u look at character development,story and acting shawshank comes out on top.If for some reason u aint seen this film watch it now... it truly IS the greatest.and remember hope is a good thing maybe the best of things.....and no good thing ever dies....and nor will shawshank.6.58x10^96 is what i give it out of 10	
 Beautiful in its restraint.		10

 Better than expected	This was an awesome movie. I didn't expect it to be that good, when I first started to watch it. First time I saw it I fell asleep. It must have been because I was tired. Because now it was a wonderful movie. And if anybody from Mt. Vernon, Iowa reads this. It's great to watch it as we were supposed to do it in a class there last year but weren't allowed to because of the rating (R).	10
 The Best Film I Think I've Ever Seen!!!!!!	I can't even go into words about how this film moved me.  The themes of hope and friendship are the powerful strings that tugged at my heart through out. A flawless masterpeice with excellent performances by Freeman and Robbins. For years, I've heard a lot of talk about this movie.  Damn, I'm glad I finally saw it.  10 out of 10....to say the least.	10
 Excellent! Definitely on my top ten list!	Only those who have been in prison can appreciate best the dreams and hopes that keep folks in there going. Most are merely pipe dreams - never to be realised. I think this flick hits the nail on the head, pardon the cliché. 10 outta 10!	
 You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free	"I have no doubt in saying that this is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a tale of suffering and despair, but also one of hope and redemption - as the title suggests. The truth of life lies within each one of us - just as it lay within Andy Dufresne - all we have to do is find it. Once you know the truth, it will set you free. The message of this film is that there is always hope, there is always truth, and together these two bring redemption - even in Shawshank!"	10
 Ranks right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird		
 Classic!	I'm kind of lost for words for this movie. I saw it last night on my DVD-player and what I saw was brilliance. The story is about a banker Andy (Tim Robbins) who get prisoned for murdering his wife and her secret lover. In prison he says he's innocent, which makes the other inmates break out in laughter. No one is innocent in prison they say. `They've all been f***ed by lawyers.' What follows is a fight for justice. A inmate (George Freeman) who calls himself Red (the other inmates call him that because he's `irish') finds something special in Andy. They connect soon and becomes good friends. What strikes me about the main characters is that hope and belief is something that they always have. Even though they go through some very tough times in prison, they always have that good confidence in themselves. Go see this movie, if you love the concept of feeling free. There's no let downs or grief ending this movie. You have to see it for yourself.	10
 A heartwarming tale of hope and human spirit	Hope, love, belief, friendship, feeling. Watch this film and re-establish once again what is good about the movies. If you don't particularly like watching films, I urge you to watch this and experience something unlike you have experienced before. This, alongside AMERICAN BEAUTY, is one of the greatest films ever made.	10
 Flawless	Any movie that you can see over 30 times and doesn't get old, doesn't become prone to having mistakes found in it and still keeps you anticipating the ending even though you know what's going to happen is a great movie. Flawless is the only word I can use to describe this movie.  From the acting of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins to the screen play by Stephen King, this film doesn't have one flaw in it.  This film has one of the all time best endings if not the best ending I've ever seen.  A definite master piece of a movie.	
 A classic that is under-appreciated.	This movie is definitely on my best of the decade list.  It borrows heavily from a couple movies and makes a fresh, dramatic approach to story telling. Excellent directing, writing, and acting.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are awesome in this film.  This is film-making at its best.  I own the VHS and DVD versions of this film, and I highly recommend this film to everyone.	
 In my top 3 of the best movies of all time.	This is one of the best movies of all time; an absolute masterpiece!  It brings me to tears every time I see it and I never tire of it.  It is a shame that this movie came out in 1994 because Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump stole it's thunder.  Had it been released in '95, '96, '98, or '99.  It surely would have been a front runner the best picture oscar.  I exclude '97 because nothing could have beat the almighty Titanic.  Everyone should see this movie because it is the best example of good people triumphing over evil and that hope still exists.  The ending will put you in a good mood, I guarantee it!	10
 just to say...	I love just drifting through the IMDb just to read others opinions on certain movies, and having checked out the comments on Shawshank Redemption, I'm amazed that some of the latest reviews are from people who have who have only just watched it in the last few weeks. I'm even more pleased that they acknowledge it as one of the best films made, and that it lived up to the hype that has passed via word of mouth. It is a criminal offence that it did not win a single Oscar but at least it not one of those films that will be classed as an undiscovered gem. Career best performances are brought out of all members of the cast: Clancy Brown, Bill Gunton and Bill Sadler will surely never hit those heights again. It may not have been a box office hit but all associated with the movie should feel proud. The cliche is true of The Shawshank Redemption: they don't make them like that any more. Spread the word!	
 AWESOME!	"Ya know, I never heard of the Shawshank Redemption before I came to the IMDB. I looked at the top 250 and saw it ahead of 1994's Forrest Gump and in the number 2 spot all time and thought, ""man, what is this?"" I found out a couple weekends ago and I'm not in the least bit disapointed. It was great, I loved it. I can say nothing that hasn't been said already. Great film, I wish I had seen it earlier. Awesome! Haven't seen it? SEE IT!"	
 nothing out of place. it all fits together perfectly	"this movie is one of only 3 that I have on dvd right now, and I am so glad that I own it.  anyone who is a movie fan of any kind should see this. this is an amazing movie shows what someone can do when they hope.  andy duphresne was a character who had hope and kept it alive for 20 years even though he was in prison for life with a crime he didn't commit.  every aspect of this movie: the camera work, the acting, the dialogue, and the story work together in a perfect blend of drama.  the best part was when red came in for his 3rd parole hearing.  his first 2 times, he had just told them what he thought they wanted to hear.  ""yes, I believe that i'm entirely cured.  i believe that i am no longer a danger to society.""  he was rejected those 2 times.  but the third he was honest, and the outcome was far different.  A nearly perfect movie."	10
 Poetry in Motion Pictures	Getting to see The Shawshank Redemption was for me a lengthy process, but when I finally caught it it was more than worth the wait. In the history of movies there have been many impressive debuts from promising directors. With The Shawshank Redemption, Frank Darabont has vaulted himself into the ranks of Orson Welles and John Huston. There has not been a more memorable movie experience in the last decade, and it gratifies me to see that users of this site regard this film as highly as it ought to be.	10
 Perfect Film		10
 Should you see this movie?	"After hearing all of the comments on this one, such as, ""Greatest Ever Made,"" ""I loved it,"" ""why didn't it win movie of the year?"" I had very high expectations upon seeing it.I was not in the least disappointed. This movie IS all it's made up to be. Yes, without a doubt, you SHOULD see this movie.The story is a thought-provoking one of hope, and how to find meaning in order in the apparent chaos of life. Andy escapes from the prison in an attempt to find himself, after his good friend Brooks, who has been released after decades of living in the prison, runs into bad fortune. Andy's other friend who is also released manages to find himself like Andy did through his help. This is a story of the torture humans inflict on one another and how it is escaped through hope.10/10"	
 Positive, and to the point.	Wonderful, wonderful movie, one of the greatest stories ever told. Terrific acting, and some of the best dialogue that I have ever heard before in a movie.  Brillant screenplay and excellent directing.  Why didn't this movie win Best Picture?	10
 I had heard so much...	I had heard so many good things about this movie, that I just had to see it. I was not disappointed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Period.  Tim Robbins was outstanding, simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman was wonderful and I did not know that Gil Bellows had so much in him.  This movie was absolutely breathtaking.  The scenery, the realism, the characters, everything was simply outstanding.  I sat through the entire movie, spellbound by the whole thing, and then I rewound it and watched again.  I've seen 6 times since, and I always find new and wonderful things everytime I see it.  I loved it.  It was amazing.  This movie is not just about prison, but it's about friendship.  A 20-year-long friendship between two inmates.  I recommend this movie for anyone who needs to find out what real friendship is all about.  This is truly one of the best movies ever.	10
 Hope is a good thing, Brooks was wrong...	This is my favorite movie of all time. It is about one man's struggle of trying to cope with his life in prison sentence for a crime he didnt commit. This movie make prisoners look like true human beings, not just savages. You really learn about each of the characters. Morgan Freeman gives a great role as Red, who stands by Andy in every instance.	10
 The greatest movie ever made	The greatest movie ever made.  The script is amazing.  Tim Robbins is amazing.  Morgan Freeman is amazing.  The rest of the cast is amazing, particularly the guy who played the villain in Highlander.  The film is just amazing and it is tragic that it was overlooked by the academy.	10
 a classic	too bad it came out in '94 with gump and fiction.  deserved to win some awards.  compelling flick based on a s. king short story that proves he is not a hack.  (Check out Different Seasons which also has The Body (Stand By Me) and Apt Pupil.    The movie follows the short story well with a few embellishments. Good casting, though i think tim robbins might have been an alternate choice.  star quality deliveries by morgan freeman and bob gunton. in an era when we see much garbage find its way to the screen, swhawshank represents what movies should strive to achieve.	
 Really astounding		10
 The Greatest	This film sortta runs along and while your watching you dont know why your watching but you cant stop and then when it finishes you think WOW and have the funny feelin in the pit of your stomach and all up your spine, the feelin you get when you know you have watched a cinema masterpiece, i only wish i had been able to see this in the movies rather than on vhs, but it will soon become an addition to my dvd collection.The acting is superb and the storyline just gives you hope	10
 A superb production makes Shawshank a must-see!		
 Easy to like		9
 This movie is better than the novel	That's my feeling when I finished reading the novel recently. Frank Darabont obviously made a lot of major modifications. The ending scene is one of them. Forrest Gump is good. Pulp Fiction is good too. But this movie is even better. And I'm glad that I saw it in the theater, not on the videotape.	10
 In search of excellence	The Shawshank Redemption never made it to the big screen in Sweden, at least not what I heard of. And I really can't understand why. It is excellent. It's a calm and unsettling story of a man's (Robbins) life in jail, of the friendship between him and his fellow lifer, Red (Freeman) and the disgusting life in a corrupt prison in the 50's and 60's. Excellent performances, great camera angles and one of the very best endings of any film.Stephen King wrote the story. Why should I be surprised? His novels and short stories make for great films - but most are turned into crap, like It. This one, however, is one of the best movies there is.	9
 Forget the rest...		10
" The ""Rocky"" of Prison Films"	This is much more than a prison film.  This is a film about how the human spirit can conquer the most unspeakable abyss and come out clean at the other side.  In addition, the story at the heart of it, of Andy (Tim Robbins) and Red (Morgan Freedman)is simply a story of two men's friendship -- something seldom explored in cinema, and rarely as well.  Lastly, the theme of hope echoes and throughout the film and reverberates in the viewer's minds like an aria against hard prison walls.	10
 One of King's, and possibly one of the, best.	I read Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption as part of Stephen King's Different Seasons, and loved the story.. to see just how much one person can go through, and not only remain sane, but keep his morals about him, even in the purgatory of a corrupt prison. The book was incredible. But the movie took it one step further, with incredibly well chosen actors and a beautiful sense of the book that is hard to set to a movie, as well as lines that I still remember at the drop of a hat. Incredible, and one of my favorite movies of all time.	10
 One of the Best!	Hey, I have to say that this movie is one of my favorites.  It is up on my top 10.  Anyway, this movie is amazing.  The story, the acting, and anything else you can think of make this movie a classic.  Morgan Freeman (plays the character red) did an excellent job on his role.  I think he was totally robbed when he didn't get the Oscar for best supporting actor.  To get back on the movie, if you looking for a good one to watch, you have to see this. The movie is wonderfully played.  Also hats off to the great job Tim Robbins did playing his main character Andy Dufresne. If you haven't seen this one, your missing out!!	10
 Not just a prison movie but a movie that gives hope	After seeing this movie for the first time I was stunned.  Living in Maine i was very interested in the whole story.  The prison featured in the movie is very similar to our own Thomaston State prison.  This is not just a good movie, but a great story as well.  It keeps you wanting to see Andy set free throughout the whole thing.	10
 Wow	I first saw this movie on TBS one night, and wasn't all that interested in it at first. But as the movie progressed, I found myself totally glued to the TV. This movie is quite possibly the best movie I've ever seen. Every single thing in this movie is perfect, the acting, chemistry, plot. Its all so wonderfully done. The ending of this movie was really great.  Its really hard to describe how good this movie is. Just go get it, you'll never regret seeing it.	10
 Fantastic.	I'm not going to elaborate on what has already been written by others - except to say that the popularity for this film is enormous.  I don't think I know ANYONE who didn't like it - it will be recognised as one of THE films of the 90's.	10
 I hope...	"This movie was deeply moving.  I have seen it about six times so far and cried the first four times I saw it.  As a person who has at times felt as if I was sentenced to ""the hole"", I could relate to Andy and to Red. Perhaps that is one reason the movie has touched so many people.The message and heart in this film is profound.  When Red said, ""I hope....."" at the end of the movie, I was hoping too."	10
 A Heartfelt Masterpiece	OK, so I am a huge fan of Stephen King as well as of the cinema itself, and it took me almost 5 years to finally see The Shawshank Redemption.  I think I was one of the few people on the planet who did not see this fantastic motion picture.  Everything about this film exudes greatness, from the performances of Freeman and Robbins to the masterful screenplay, cinematography, cast and especially the direction.  I agree with most people who fume over the fact that films such as this one (perfect in every sense) rarely, if ever garner an Oscar win.  Its a shame that the big budget over - hyped (and often mediocre at best films) win all the awards while a gem like The Shawshank Redemption comes up empty.  You never grow tired of watching this film and its introspective ending is just perfect.  If you are one of the 4 remaining people who has yet to see this masterpiece, find 2 hours of quiet time and watch it.  You will thank yourself afterwards.	10
 It was much better than Cats...	What amazes me about the Shawshank Redemption is that I can watch it over and over again without losing interest.  Normally for me, even with movies I enjoy, once is enough.  However, when I'm channel surfing and I flip across Shawshank, I almost always leave it on and watch it to the end.	10
 It's just BETTER than other movies...		10
 heartfelt comments of the best film that i have seen of its ilk	my comments of this film will be brief. it is a quite simply a rewarding film in which the acting is very moving and the actual storyline is superb iwas engrossed in the film from start to finish. it was a drama of what life can throw back at you in the extreme.not been a writing man i will close with the words i think describe this truly great film.      moving,thought provoking,and one of the best films of its kind.	
 This film is like an excellent, five-course meal.		10
 I dedicated a lot of time to this comment, but I still hate summaries.		10
 Incredible		
 One of my all-time favorites	The Shawshank Redemption is one of my all time favorites. Robbins and Freeman in particular, but everyone else as well delivers an outstanding performance in this one. Few films, if any, captures your mind like Shawshank does. I just hope my DVD copy don't wear out...	10
 The Best Prison Film	I must say that this is the best prison films of all time. I couldn't believe that this film didn't win any Academy Awards. This film could have win at least one or two. Also, I thought that Tim Robbins could have earned an Oscar nomination. He gave a superb performance. But the one who was powerful in this film is Morgan Freeman. He gave one of the best performances that I have ever seen in film. It was heartwrenching. I like that tagline: Fear can make you prisoner, Hope can set you free. Frank Darabont did superb filmmaking in this film. By the way, I found out that Allen Greene, the person that Frank dedicated at the end, was the director's agent and his close personal friend. If you want to see a film that takes place in a prison or dramatic films, then see this film. You will never regret it. It is the best prison film since Midnight Express. SEE IT!	10
 One of the Best.	"Highly reccommended.  Best if you watch by yourself.  I cried at the end, and I never cry.Love the friendship between Andy and Red, great performances by both.  The plot moves along perfectly, I felt what the characters felt.  Rivals ""Seven"" for one of the best endings I have ever seen."	10
 The fact that this movie didn't receive any major Academy Awards (nominated for several!) is UNFORGIVABLE!	If an alien who knows nothing about the Academy Awards were to suddenly land on earth and then introduced to the Academy Awards and asked to watch the nominated movies for 1995 and then shown the results, she would have absolutely no respect for the Academy Awards.  Shawshank Redemption is pure genius at every level: acting, script, cinematography, character development, and on and on and on.  Movies don't get much better than this!The moral of the story is that there are great movies and performances out there that have not been properly recognized by the Academy, so make sure an award is not the only criterion you use when searching for a truly great film.	
 Masterfully done.	This is one of the best movies around. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are great in this movie. I'm fifteen, and the only part of this movie I didn't appreciate is the part about the homosexual rapist gang. That part I can do without, but the rest of the movie is flawless. Rent it, buy it, steal it, borrow it, do whatever it takes to see this movie.	10
 Robbed of its Oscars!!!		10
 The Best Movie of All Time!	This film is by far my favorite movie to date. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have great chemistry. Once you watch this movie a second time you see how all the small details that you may have seen as insignificant fall into place. My personal favorite is how the rock hammer was in the starting pages of the book of Exodus from the bible.	10
 Truly unforgettable!	I've seen this movie only once, and I think that's the main reason why I like this movie very much.  I have not been able to forget it.  I has remained in my mind ever since I saw it.  When I saw this movie, it made a tremendous impact on me.  This is a beautiful movie about triumph and the power of friendship.  Among other things, this movie contains terrific performances.  Perhaps the best performance is that of the great Morgan Freeman, as a prison inmate.  And of course, Tim Robbins also shines, playing the lead character.  There are so many memorable scenes in this movie.  One particular scene that stands out is the moment when Robbins' character breaks free, and you see him standing in the rain, shirtless and with his arms stretched out.  But what is the most memorable scene is the ending--a fitting ending to this touching and haunting story.  If you haven't seen this movie, definitely do so. This movie is so powerful that you only need to see once for it to move you.  This movie is definitely one of the best movies ever.	
 Movie that you remember	This movie is a work of art , it is a movie that makes you think about how great it is to be alive and free , and how other peoples may have a struggle each day to stay alive and free ,  in the mind of themselves ,for a start .	10
 it deserved an oscar	This is one of my fave movies because its so beautiful. The acting , the story and the filmmaking. This is how all movies should be made...with heart. The story is so simple but its shaped and made a master piece.If you have not seen this movie, and you are 15 or 55 years old,I'm telling you that you are missing a lot.I give it ********** out of ********** because it moved me so much, the way its showing the human nature, the good and the ugly side of it.	
" ""Good for you, Andy."""	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are in a dynamic role in this film. I could not imagine a lot of innocent people inside a gigantic prison of history. When I saw Clancy Brown first time, looked so tough, he's big too. I also like Clancy's role, too. He should be a great fighter. What is good for Andy Dufrense (Robbins) is that he makes an unbelievable escape route to run away from prison, finally.	
 A wonderful film and a terrific story !	The story is excellent and the actors all perform well. Never a boring scene. Good drama. Some scenes are even funny ! The plot is superb. I thought Stephen King only wrote horror-stories, but I guess I was wrong !If you see this movie on video, sit down and watch it all and LISTEN !  You have to pay attention! And then you'll love it !	10
 A Cinematic Triumph		
 Great cast, great crew, great show		9
 Probably the best movie ever made	Incredible.  That's all there is to say about it.  Tim Robbin's turns in a fantastic performance as does Morgan Freeman and all of the supporting cast. The story is captivating and the characters are well drawn.  All screen writers (aspiring as well as established) need to review this movie periodically to remember why they love movies.  Movie scores do not get any better than in Shawshank.	10
 A very good (subjectively) review	In 100 years there will be 'Casablanca.'  There will be 'Citizen Kane.' There will be '2001, A Space Oddessy.'  There will be 'The Godfather.'  And there will be 'The Shawshank Redemption.'  It is amazing that this much overlooked film has in six years reached the stature of a Hollywood legend, not only in my estimation but in the opinion of almost everyone I've spoken to about it.  This movie has gained a larger audience through word of mouth than it had the entire time it was in the theaters.  This is quite simply one of the three best movies I've ever seen.	10
 A movie with all the good stuff--tears, laughs, action, thrills, and a wonderful theme....HOPE.		10
 Another great jail film	I've seen this film and,as I like this kind of movies I decided to comment about it. The main character believes he doesn't deserve the guilt and try during twenty years, to find a way to escape. But the best thing of the film is the friendship that he developed with the other prisoner. A friendship that remained after they got out of the prison. Is really interesting to see this movie and think a little bit in the destiny that our lives can take someday.	9
 Praise for the King of thrillers	A great film for those who enjoy prison-escape-type films and also for Stephen King fans. Brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Jacobs Ladder) and Morgan Freeman (Se7en) emphasize the intricate and clever plot. A must for everyone who's even just slightly fond of watching movies !!	9
 Now here's a movie that's enjoyable over and over again		9
 One of the best	This is a rare movie that deserves a 10 - My reasoning; that I would not change one single, solitary thing about it, period.This is arguably my favorite movie of all time.  It fails to become boring despite repeated viewings.	10
 Survival and Triumph		9
 2nd best movie ever	"This is the second best movie ever, with only ""Heat"" beating it out. Stephen King is a great writer, this being the second best novella in ""Different Seasons,"" ""Apt Pupil"" being the best of the four stories(I haven't seen the movie yet).  Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins work well together, and Thomas Newman's original music is great.  ""Hope Springs Eternal."""	10
 An excellent movie.		9
 A tale that will stay with you forever.	There are few movies that are never forgotten. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films, that always stays in the back of the mind.  Andy Dufresne is a character that the viewer finds themselves caring about from his first appearance.  Everyone knows a Red or a Brooks.  The triumph of the human spirit comes out. When the movie ends, it leaves you with a sense that you just endured a great journey.  There are few films that actually allow the viewer to feel as if the actions happening to the main actor, are happening to them.	
 On my top 10 movies of all-time List	This is one of the greatest films that I have ever seen.  This is a great story about one man's struggle for hope.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are exceptional as you really begin to feel for their characters.  Every time I see this movie, I have to smile at the ending, and in a way I'm shocked, even though I know what's going to happen.  All in all, a great viewing experience, and #2 on my list of the greatest movies of all-time.	10
 Great Plot. Great Acting. Best Movie Ever.	I really don't like Stephen King very much, but every once in a while he really surprises me (Stand By Me and Shawshank Redemption).  I also am not a very big fan of prison movies either, but this definitely is the exception. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both outstanding in this film.  Their characters are completely convincing.  This is the best film of the 1990's in my opinion, and my favorite of all time.	10
 wonderful!	"i love love love love love this movie!  I dont know how many movies i can say that i've walked away from feeling completely overcome with happiness and satisfaction, but i know this is one of them.  this is one of my favorite movies!  i can't remember the last movie that i cried with happiness at the end.  ""Different Seasons"" is a great collection of King stories, and two of his best movie adaptations have been taken from it: shawshank and ""Stand by Me."" i thought it was nice to see a movie that relied on something other than sex and violence, and makes the viewer feel so wonderful afterwards! a must must must see!"	8
 Why you should see this film.	This film is purely exceptional in every respect, and as such is in my opinion the greatest film ever made.  The performances from lead characters Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are brilliant in every way, they are both moving and totally believable, tacing the viewer on a rollercoaster of emotions before leaving them in a ending that is unforgettable.The story of Andy Dufresne's tenure at Shawshank Prison is an inspirational story, and whether you want a great drama, or just an entertaining night's viewing this film is a must see!	10
 Simply told can sometimes tell it all...		
 A beautiful and inspirational film	This film is a beautiful story about what faith and hope and passion are about.  The struggle between the desire for something more and the resignation about your lot in life.  On many levels this film challenges you to both seize the day and overcome fear and limitations about yourself. All without a preach-y tone or a moralistic attitude and with lots of interesting characters and action.  This movie also offers insight into the truth that can be found in a real friendship.I highly recommend this movie to anyone.	10
 DAN WAS HERE		
 Not a word wasted	"If you haven't seen this movie, skip down to the next comment, because a SPOILER follows. This movie has been aptly (and deservedly) praised by others, so I'll comment on just one thing.  Watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"" two or three times and witness the superb foreshadowing, even just within the dialogue. Example: when Andy, appearing depressed, rambles to Red about what it would be like to be outside prison and in Mexico, Red brings him back to reality by telling him that the idea of ever leaving prison is ""just a bunch of shitty pipe dreams.""  Then Andy actually escapes by crawling through a sewer pipe.  Brilliant, just brilliant."	
 Overwhelming triumph of the human spirit	Few films capture the triumph of the human spirit the way that The Shawshank Redemption did.  Not only was it an original true-to-life story, it added a touch of comedy and a heart-warming story of friendship.  At first, I expected little from this movie (granted I was 12), but it has quickly grown into my very favorite movie of all time; and it competes with Schindler's List and GoodFellas for the best movie of the decade.  As the 90's come to an end, we see a familiar theme in cinema: destruction and armageddon (literally); it is good to see a reversal in a beautiful film from promising young talent (Darabont).	10
 Superb!	"This movie is one of the best I've ever seen, and it deserved all the Academy Awards it received. The only other movie that has made me experience so many different emotions during it's running time, has to have been ""Forrest Gump"". Because ""The Shawshank Redemption"" made me smile, it brought tears to my eyes, it made me laugh, and it made me curse at the injustice that takes place. And the acting-chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is nothing but excellent. Yep, this movie is great, and nothing but great! If you haven't seen it, you definetly should! And IF you HAVE seen it, you probably agree that it's a wonderful movie!"	
 The best movie ever.	I don't know why so many people saying that this movie is not so very special. Maybe it's because they don't have seen it multiple times. This film gets bigger every time you watch it. I have watched this movie more than 10 times. And my opinion is that this is the greatest movie ever made, and that you have to go and see it. NOW!	10
 one great movie	it is great to see that this movie is in the top 5. this is where it belongs.  one of the greatest movies of all time.  what made it great was they showed how two had struggles of their own in prison.  one wanted to get out, and does after 19 years,  and the other makes parole as an old man and almost feels he serves no purpose in the outside world and feels that jail is where he belongs.  this is one of my most favorite movies and its hard too see how some didn't like it 10/10	10
" Probably the best ""surprisingly good"" film I´ve seen!"	"I didn´t expect much from this film before I saw it. It had OK stars, the plot sounded pretty familiar and it was originally a Stephen King story. Once I started watching it I thought: ""Hey! This is pretty good!"". And it got better as it went along. The story was was a perfect mix of high drama and ""feelgood"" quality. It didn´t matter it was long and the story went along slowly. It was all build-up for the amazing ending which caught me by surprise. Somehow the film has a sense of being more than it seems at first, it´s really an epic story of one man´s determination against the system (or even his given destiny!). If you´ve never seen this film, go see it -you won´t be disappointed!"	9
 This is the kind of movie that inspires.	Very rarely does a movie come along that inspires people to hold on to their faintest hopes.  'The Shawshank Redemption' is just such a movie.  Have you ever felt like all hope was lost?  Tim Robbins plays a wrongfully convicted man who very easily could have let his hopes die, but instead decides to patiently plot his escape to freedom.  Excellent performances make this movie an incredible can't miss.	10
 Best adaptation of a Stephen King work.	In my opinion, this is the best adaptation of a Stephen King work ever done. It is totally involving from start to finish, and has one of the most satisfying conclusions I've ever seen.  It is one of those intriguing films which cause you to work backward in your mind from the climax to figure out how it all happened.	8
 My favourite movie - EVER!	"I've seen some good movies in my time (The Godfather part1 + 2 come to mind), but, I can honestly say that none have moved me like this. I love the sence of hope that it gives anyone, and the fact that despite everything else, Andy Dufrense, still has hope. ""Get Busy livin' or get busy dyin'!"" A friend of mine recomended it to me, as the greatest movie he's ever seen. I have to agree.>I just loved it, and with Hollywood would try harder at making good movies as opposed to trashy, shallow, movies that are aimed at the lowest common denominator.Rating out-of-10? Guess!"	10
 This movie rules	If you haven't seen this masterpiece, you need to watch it.  If you look at the voting, 47.3% of the voters have given it a 10.  I'd give it a 12, it's the best movie I've ever seen.  This movie is hilarious at times, but parts of it can make you cry, it ends on a perfect note and has a great cast.  I've seen this movie multiple times, and like it more every time.	10
 The Best Movie Ever	OK.  This is definitely my favorite movie of all time.  The acting by all actors is superb, especially the roles of Dufresne and Red, played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  I have been a fan of the story by Stephen King ever since I read it in high school.  When I heard that Frank Darabont, who also directed a short King film (The Woman in the Room) in 1983, would be writing the screenplay and directing I was ecstatic.  This film could not have been adapted better by Kubrick or King himself.  Can't wait for The Green Mile, Frank.	10
 Surprising	"What praises can I sing about this movie that haven't been sung already? However, what this movie DID do was surprise me.  I don't know whether I should have expected the movie's ending or not, but all the same it did give me a bit of a shock.  While some of the things have been seen before many times (the bible-thumping hypocritical warden, for one), I was pleased with some of the lines from the movie (""Trust in the Lord...your ass belongs to me.""), and delighted with how the movie was wrapped up so neatly.  See this movie not as an artsy, thematic flick, but see it as an excellent, expertly done story, and you will agree with me when I say it's one of the five best movies of our decade."	8
 Great, great, great movie	This is by far and away the best movie I have ever seen.   If you haven't seen it, do so.  (If you don't know the movies outcome, definately see it!).Everything about this movie is outstanding.  What most people notice first about great movies is the fine acting.  Not only is this film's acting superb, but the script, the costumes, the scenery, the directing...everything...just outstanding.  Rent it for the first time...rent it again...I recently sat through TNT's double presentation, and it still had me totally absorbed, even the second time around.	10
 Truely a magnificent motion picture.		7
 The best movie, ever!! Two thumbs up + eight fingers 10		10
 Lived up to hype!	I did not see Shawshank Redemption in the theater and was hesitant to see it because everyone told me what a great movie it was. Usually when that happens and I see the movie it never lives up to the hype, SR not only lived up to its hype but surprassed it. Anyone who didn't like this movie either has no heart or no brain. It's a movie which forces you in a gentle way to think and to feel.	
 Unforgettable!	Okay, the first 20 minutes you think this is a regular movie you have seen a hundred times. But then you are wrong. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie you`ll never forget. Morgan Freeman, not to mention Tim Robbins, both make this movie unforgettable!	9
 One of my favorites	"This movie was amazing in so many ways.  Rarely do movies based on books do the book justice, but the movie was inanely accurate.  The casting was flawless and the actors could not have done better.  I don't think the phrase ""Brooks was here"" will ever leave my subconscious.  Every character has so much depth to offer the viewer, it is an amazing look at the human race.  Certainly not a movie to take light-heartedly."	
 A movie that turns you inside out with emotions	I'm not a fan of violent prison movies and I certainly don't watch them twice. Shawshank Redemption is the first exception to that rule. I have to admit, that I hated the few violence scenes and the shooting, but in this movie it was necessary to convey the message of hope. Although I think that this is a wonderful, touching movie, I think it's also a fairy tale. Everything that happens to the main character is an exception, rather than a rule which weakens the movie. Other than that, it's a marvelous story about friendship, survival and hope. Watch and see for yourself how a person survives hell on earth.	9
 Breathtaking, amazing, leaves you in awe.	What can I say? It is well worth the viewing. Breathtaking. >Leaves you in awe. You laugh and cry, and feel glad to be alive >after this movie is through with you. One to own and watch over >and over. I highly recommend	10
 Good not great prison flick	Interesting study of wrongly-convicted Robbins sent to jail and abused by evil warden and (initially) fellow prisoners.  As film develops, Robbins turns tables on everyone.  Understated  performance by the lead; Morgan Freeman, as a fellow prisoner, actually drives this flick.  Didn't see where this differed from half a dozen other good prison movies, but that's why they make all those flavors.  Very satisfying resolution.	8
 A movie that is the epitome of a masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption came out better on screen than it was in print. Brilliant performances by Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and a stellar supporting cast leaves a lasting imprint on the viewer. With a superb score and dynamic lighting and sets, this movie should be THE example by which other movies compare to and work by.THUMBS WAY UP!	10
 Best Picture of All Time	This movie is truly my favorite film of all time.  It certainly should have won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1994.  Unfortunately, Forrest Gump and Tom Hanks were out and about that year as well, so Shawshank took a back seat. It never should have.  This is the most well-acted, scripted, directed and filmed movie I have seen to date.  From the narration to the awe-inspiring ending, this movie is, quite simply, perfect.  I've not been able to say that about another movie before or since.	10
 Worth seeing more than once.	The Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite films of all time because it triumphs in capturing human feelings through it's acting, music, scenery and many moods.  Although the story takes place in a bitter prison, we all can relate to the feelings of dispair and the bonding of true friends and the hope that it brings.  A masterpiece.	10
 Very few things in life are better than meeting your best friend by the blue waters of the ocean.		10
 It is the story, not he who tells it...		10
 Superb - This film is a modern day classic		10
 Why wasnt Robbins up for an Oscar??	"This is a wonderful movie, thanks to Tim Robbins. His role as Andy Dufresne is just amazing! I usually don't watch prison films but this one just pulls you in and doesnt let go until the end. Morgan Freeman is very good in this but I still think it was Robbins that clinched it as a top rated movie. I can't believe horror writer Stephen King came up with the story for this. What an amazing man! Now I see why they had to slip Rita Hayworth into the movie. I wonder how she'd respond to Morgan's little comment about her when they were watching ""Gilda""? :-) If you havent seen this film, please do ASAP.. it's worth it!"	
 Morgan Freeman is one of the greatest actors of all time.	"Especially in this film.  He can break your heart or make you laugh,  and that's before he speaks.  He will have you cheering at the end when ""Red"" gets  in front of the parole board.  I watched this only because someone told me it was great.  It didn't look like a movie I'd like.  Prison dramas aren't generally my thing.  This one is different.  The first half is brutal and at times difficult to watch, but it helps set the story in motion.  You really feel you are there with Andy and Red.  One of my favorite scenes is when the prisoners are on the roof of the prison drinking beer.  You have to see it to understand what I mean.  There isn't enough adjectives to describe this film I can only say that this one is definitely a must see. This one is right up there with ""Amadeus"" as my two favorite movies of all time.  Please do not miss it."	10
 An underrated movie, maybe the best in the last 15 years	"Why I loved (and still love) this film? There are three main reasons? First the writing is exceptionnal, I haven't noticed a flaw in the scenario (every scene seems logical when you see the film again). Then the actors gives the best of themselves (Morgan Freeman delivers maybe his most poignant performance), but what is remarkable in this movie, is the quality of supporting actors (without them the film wouldn't have worked so perfectly) And finally like I underline above the film shows its full potential only when you've seen it (a least) twice, then you realise the complexity of the story, in fact they could have made two films from this one: One about Red (the old con), one about Andy (""the fresh fish"") and his struggle to endure life in prison."	
 the story plays on a lot of different levels	story was excellent. i like it when i can relate to a man who is in prison--even though i haven't been to one. my guess is the author's connected me through human emotions and the basic human condition to his characters. acting left nothing to be desired.i particularly appreciated symbology of the film: cigarettes were money, perverted sex was the norm, corruption from the top down, where's my life going? it doesn't sound like a prison film necessarily.	10
 Spell binding	I went to this movie on spec when it first came out.  Little was I to know that it was to become my favorite movie of all time. From the very beginning shot of the prison, to the last shot of the beach in Mexico, the movie had me in every emotion possible. Fear, joy, laughter, sadness, despair and hope. The acting was great, Freeman was robbed for not getting a deserved Oscar for this movie. It is one of those rare movies which you can sit down to over and over again.	10
 10/10		10
 The best King films omit the gore		10
 A classic	This movie was very entertaining. The acting of morgan freeman and tim robbins, were exceptional, as well as the other actors. Even though very violent, it's extremely entertaining. The script was very good, and had some humorous lines, which were hard to notice. This movie is one of the best ever, and should have one for best picture, best actor and best director. One of Stephan Kings best novels, to become a classic motion picture.	10
 True Movie Power		
 Greatest Movie of All Time	"What can I say that hasn't been said.  The beauty of this movie can hardly be put into words.  The more I watch it, the better it gets.  Mr. Darabont did a beautiful job of directing, I'm anxiously awaiting ""The Green Mile"" now.  The little scenes are what makes it beautiful.  Andy on the roof with his smile and the aerial shot of the prison while the music is playing.  I don't want to spoil anything, but the quotes are what will stay with you. After seeing this film (way too many times according to those around me), I've adopted my particular philosophy from it.  As Red says, ""Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.  That's goddamn right"".  See this movie and vote it back up to #1 on the IMDB list."	10
 The best of King films		
 I cry every time I watch this film. This movie is perfect.		10
 The best movie ever.	In my unpretentious opinion, The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie have ever made. Tim Robbins is great in that. It's a movie where you can find friendship, hope, unfair situations and reward. It's a tense movie, where you are together the players, with their feelings and emotions.I really suggest you to watch it. You will not get disappointed.	
 Wow.	Without a doubt, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the absolute best movies that I have ever seen.  Seeing a movie with characters that seem so true to life that I could actually care for them was a rare and very welcome experience for me.  The film was made in such a way that you didn't really know how it was going to end, but what an ending indeed.  I thought it was one of the most rewarding endings to a movie in recent history. I don't know how this movie was passed up for an Academy Award for best picture, or at least a nomination, amazes me.  Well deserving of its rank of #4 in the top 250 movies of all time.	10
 Movie that gets better with each viewing!	First time I saw this, I was blown away. Second time, I was amazed even more. The movie sucks you in and doesn't let you till the awesome end. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as well as Tim Robbins, and the rest of the stellar cast. Hard to believe Morgan started his big screen career 12 years ago. I think if he started acting in Hollywood when he was 20 instead of 50, he would have quite a few Oscars under his belt.Why does this film get better and better? Probably because you can find new things in each viewing. Knowing what will happen allows you to look around and check out the surroundings. You can see little things that contribute to understanding the story better.SPOILER ALERT!The best part? The very end when Andy Dufresne escapes and shows that with determination, that a person can do anything they want including getting away from a prison after digging a hole in the wall for 19 years.SPOILER END!Overall, this movie is one of the best of all time. Now I will go back to anticipating The Green Mile with Frank Darabont directing and starring Tom Hanks.	10
 the greatest	i have to say that i had to be coerced into seeing it.  my cousin told me the title and that totally turned me off.  but after finally seeing this masterpiece i could have shot myself for thinking the way that i did.  this film quickly became my alltime favorite. when people had asked me before what my favorite movie is, i had a few.  but now it is hands down my favorite.  i could watch it 10 times a day and still want to watch it one more time.  even though i'm only 16 i know a good movie when i see one.  i am so disappointed in the academy for not giving it any awards.  but then again they also didn't give jim carrey a nomination for the truman show.  so anyone out there wants to see it, do.	10
 The Best Movie Ever Created	"How can someone not love this movie? Not only does Stephan King create the best plot and story line, but the actors such as Tim give the effect to make it a great. The story is perfect , its also honest. Morgan and Tim made the best pair of cons. And Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown made the best ""bad"" enforcement duo.Complete 10/10 and a great movie for any collection.Although if something like a guy getting his head beat in by a night stick or some guy crawling through a sewage pipe up to his chin in crap , if stuff like that makes you a little sick , Id suggest pop a gravol and tuff it out princess its not that bad."	9
 One of best films ever made	Stephen King's original story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption' has long been one of my favourites, and when I heard it was getting the Hollywood treatment I was suspicious (after all, Stephen King's Hollywood track record isn't exactly outstanding). Then I heard Morgan Freeman was involved, and thought, 'Sounds good!' I was living in England when the film was released, so had to wait until several weeks after the U.S. opening before I saw it. I took my husband along with me: he's not a huge King fan, and I think that the prospect of a two-hour-plus prison film based on a Stephen King story wasn't hugely appealing: but we both came out realising we had seen a truly great film. Strangely, British movie critics (on the whole) gave the film a much better reception than did the American ones, and right from the start SHAWSHANK has been more highly thought of there: the British film magazine EMPIRE has recognised its quality from the start, and in its recent tenth anniversary issue picked it as one of the ten best films of the 1990s (with detailed reasons). To me it's one of the ten best films I've ever seen: it's one that repays multiple viewings, and the two central performances are outstanding. I'm now eagerly awaiting the film's DVD release.	
 One of the best movies ever made!	I am a huge fan of Stephen King, so I had read the story. When I saw it was being made into a movie, I was skeptical at first, as many movies do not live up to the stories or novels they are derived from. Well this one was far better than the story.	10
 A Great Film	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman headline this movie based on a story by Stephen King. Robbins is Andy, a banker falsely accused and convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover. When he arrives at the prison he is expected to crack under the pressure of prison life, but he surprises Freeman's character by surely moving through as time passes no matter what the prison throws at him. He begins making inroads with both the prisoners and the guards and warden.He sets up a tax service that all the guards from the prison and surrounding prisons use. When a lead surfaces on the possibility of Andy being innocent the warden who has used Andy to set up illegal accounts to hide money, has it snuffed out so he can keep Andy inside. This set Andy on the final course of action in the movie. The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic movie with great performances  from all of its actors. A definite movie to add to any collection. See it as soon as you can.	10
 Popular? Yes. A Great Movie? No.	I am a great fan of Stephen King's books. But not his movies. The critics are right. That includes Roger Ebert. It includes Maitlin's Summary. It includes the Academy voters. If you like horror movies over classics then this is a must see.But it is run-of-the-mill prison fare otherwise. Anyone remember Michael Caine? It is not that this isn't entertaining. It's just simply that this film doesn't belong in the top 250.	10
 That Was Goddamn Great!	I Saw this movie just today, on a small television in a High school class room. I saw it in three rows, which was actually extremely annoying while I had to wait till the next day to see what happens. I have never seen those pupils so quiet, IT REALLY IS AN AMAZING FILM - GREAT acting, great scenic play and directing in one of the best films in my memory. If you haven't seen it / go see it	10
 A comment of the best film ever.	A great movie in all categories, the best I have ever seen. Morgan Freeman have never played a role like this one. He is outstanding as Red. It is also the best movie Stephen King has ever been a part of. This is a must see.	10
 Powerful and compassionate	I don't think this film is the number one of all time.  But than, it might be.  I placed Casblanca and The Godfather higher because they haven't dated. Let's see how well the Shawshank Redemption does in twenty years.  That said, this movie is a staggering experience.  While I didn't experience it in theatres, I was impressed by the cinematography.  The performances are uniformly flawless.  I can't believe that Hawthorne beat out Robbins to a nomination.  The direction and story also make this magnificent.  But what makes it moving, is it's theme.  In the end, it's about hope.  Not an 'action' quality, but an important one.  It doesn't preach, but teaches.  The music score still haunts me.  I rank it as number one of 1994, and one of the best of the decade.	9
 My all time favorite	I must say I'm very surprised at all of these positive comments.  I'm shocked at the #2 rating. Simply because very few people I know have seen the film. When I run into the ones who have, we end up discussing it for a long time. That's the power this movie has.I have no reason to connect to the characters. I'm simply a young woman and nothing more. I've never been unjustly accused of a crime and/or thrown into prison. Yet somehow this alien situation becomes much larger and universal. You connect no matter what your circumstance is.The only disappointment I had was that I didn't get the chance to see the film in the theaters. I avoided renting it because I thought it would be boring. Please do not let that sway you. This is one of the most exciting movies I have ever seen. It's my favorite movie.	10
 No comparison	I remember when this movie came out.  It seemed like a ridiculous title, and I was more into Forrest Gump then  spending any hard earned money on this movie.  At the local multiplex, my date coerced me into going anyway, and it was one of the greatest cinematic experiences of my life.  It's like the first time you saw The Godfather, or Star Wars.  It has gradually become my all time favorite, and for two main reasons: One: to the new viewer, it may appear a rough prison movie, but what lies ahead is the enchanting tale of hope, and the enduring bond of true friendship, themes that do not appear in too many modern films.  The second reason is that after multiple viewings, i have yet to tire of it.  It grips me each time.  Perhaps it is the subtle introduction, or the mesmerizing ending.  This is the only movie I would ever dream of giving a perfect score...............	
 Best Movie Ever!	The best movie ever.  Morgan Freeman should have won the Oscar and Tim Robbins should have been nominated. The greatest sin the Academy of Motion Pictures ever did was not give this movie at least one oscar win.  0 of 7 is pathetic!  the film should have won every award it was nominated for	10
 One of the best	What can I say that hasn't already been said.  Not much I suppose.  The first time I saw this movie tears swelled in my eyes at the end,  a sign that tells me that a movie is great.  It has quickly moved to the #2 movie in my top ten list just behind Pulp Fiction.  And even though Pulp Fiction is my favorite I think Shawshank should have won best picture.  4 out of 4 stars, two thumbs up and all that jazz.  It gets better with repeated viewing too.	10
 Best all-time movie		10
 Worth its number one rating		10
 One of the best movies out there	This film combines great acting and intense plot to form a truly powerful movie. I does not matter what genre you like this film will make you feel for the characters. The best Stephen King movie by far. When watching the film to really get into it watch it without your friends around.	9
" ""Shawshank"" The Best Ever"		
 A Stephen King Sleeper	"I regret that I missed seeing this one on the big screen.  Unfortunately, I avoided it because Stephen King wrote it, and I had stereo-typed it as a horror flick.  I only decided to see it on VHS (without reading a review) after seeing its incredibly high ranking in the IMDB Top 250.In fact, this is an amazing story of inner strength and human spirit, more from the side of King that gave us ""Stand By Me"" than the side responsible for ""Cujo"".Very deserving of the Best Picture nomination."	
 A great movie with a gazillion different intertwined themes		
 Beyond Oscar-worthy	I can't add very much to the previous descriptions and praise of this movie; I just want to say that it deserves its #1 standing at IMDb and I hope it holds that place forever.  A brilliant film that speaks to the humanity in all of us.	10
 The best movie of all time!		10
 As great today as it was in theatres!	I was lucky enough to have seen this movie in a theatre.  I consider myself lucky because not only did I not want to go that night, from what I've read, very few people were able to catch this great film in its true form.  I'll never forget the moment the movie ended.  I was stunned.  My friends and I did not move and spoke scarcily on the drive home.  The Shawshank Redemption is a rare type of movie, one that not only contains all the elements of a great film, but makes you feel happy to be alive when its over.  If you haven't already, please see this movie.  And if you have, please watch it again.  I know I will!  A much deserved #1 with IMdB users!	
 From Stephen King's most surprising story, comes this near-poetic tale	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is nearly poetic, but misses slightly because of its straight-forward telling.  That isn't a flaw really.  It's just that considering some of the powerful human emotions and grandiose spritual scenes displayed, the film could have been legendary.  Still, this film is destined to be a classic and rightfully so.  Stephen King hasn't written another story that was better (Title ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" in the book ""Diffrent Seasons"" which also contains ""The Body"" which was made into another great movie, ""Stand By Me"" starring River Phoenix).  Tim Robbins and especially Morgan Freeman are outstanding.  Drama rarely gets muchs better than this and the solitude of human existence is depressingly displayed here.  Wonderful, wonderful!Oh yeah, Morgan Freeman's explanation for being named ""Red"" is probably one of the purely humorous things you'll ever hear."	9
 Pretty good, but not a masterpiece!	The only reason I rented this title was because I've seen its rating in the IMDB. Well I was hoping for a thrilling experience, a work of art at least. C'mon you raters! This is simply a good film! It's ok to watch, but if you were hoping for something better than good, then you will be disappointed. There are so many better films than this! Now, talking about the film, Tim Robbins was not the ideal match for this role and Morgan Freeman was ok for a nice old man in a Midwest bar, but definitely not for a murder convict. In general the atmosphere in the jail was laughable. So many good men, you would believe it was the Sunday mass.	8
 Just a few words in respect for the best movie ever made	I can see it again and again, this is without a doubt the best movie ever made! I love everything about it, and if you have'nt seen it yet, I must urge you to run to the nearest video store and get yourself a copy.  I'll bet you'll love it!	10
 My Favorite Film	This film is about one thing and one thing only: HOPE. Hope will get you through anything!Oh, and if you haven't already done so, don't bother reading the Stephen King novella from which this film is based. It foreshadows the ending a little too much and takes away that anxiety you get as you near the end of the film.	10
 A Very Spiritual movie	One of the best films ever made.  I thought it was very spiritual, in the sense that I learned a very powerful lesson that has helped me in my daily living.  Never give up hope. Acting is superb, directing is great, story is wonderful.  Highest recommendation.	10
 Without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen!	There are a few mistakes in this movie, but nothing real significant. The dialogue, and Morgan Freeman's monologue were perfect; went perfectly with the flow of the movie. This movie has the best finale of any movie that I've ever seen.	10
 The most satisfying ending in Cinema	"I just watched Shawshank for the nth time tonight (it was on TNT), and realized why I enjoyed the movie so much: it had one of the most cinematic, enthralling, and satisfying conclusion in movie history.  Not that I am dismissing the great story, honest and absorbing characters, and memorable scenes (the scene where an entire field full of inmates seemingly hypnotized by Mozart's opera music comes to mind).  The ending where all of the warden's sins were conveniently exposed may sound contrived in other movies, but brilliant writing filled with dry wit carried the scene through marvelously (Red: ""I'd like to think the last thing that went through the warden's head - other than the bullet - was how in hell Andy Dufresne got the best of him"").  And the way the last scene was put together, where Red's narration of 'hopes' melts into a scene where his hopes comes true (when he actually crossed the border and reunited with his old friend), was just magical.  It makes me glad that my girlfriend pushed me into watching it (""But it's just a stupid prison movie!"" I lamented).  How I was wrong!"	
 One of the greatest movies ever	I am 14, and I saw this movie just an hour ago. Although I am naive and still a child, this movie was a great movie that makes you think. It is one of the(if not)great movies of all time.	10
 A Classic Piece of Human Art	Here is a Film that shows you how vicious, and how humane, humans can be. Andy and Red are 2 of the most honest and memorable characters ever made, next to Dr. Strangelove and Charles Kane.  If u want to see real human drama at its peak, see the Shawshank Redemption at least 2 times.	10
 How did I miss this in the theaters????	I find it hard to believe how I missed this movie in the theaters.  A friend of mine told me I should see this movie when it was taken off the new release rack.  I looked at it and just shuddered.  He had to rent the movie himself and drag me into his dorm room physically before I saw it.I can't believe how good it was.  He paused it for 10 minutes in the middle so he could answer the phone and I went nuts.  I couldn't wait to see the rest of it.I can't wait until this comes out on DVD.  Until then, I will settle for my VHS copy.  Go see this movie.  :)10 out of 10	10
 after the long drought, i feel the first drops of rain	The amount of time that has past since I last saw a movie as interesting and faithful to the making of film has been more than I can remember. After that extensive wait, my thirst for a film as engrossing as The Shawshank Redemption grew to the point where it did not even register anymore. This film though, has broken the wall of disinterest I've held for cheesy, hi-tech, flashy cute flicks that have littered the cinemas as of late. The character development, cinematography, and script for The Shawshank Redemption shine through the bleak cloud that I see surrounding Hollywood these days, as it concerns itself with special effects and big name actors bent on budgets and wages. A rental that I so wish I had seen in the theaters five years ago, the camera work and display from Freeman and Robbins is a relief to view, and eye-opening connection to movies that is so rare. It's one film that tugs at all your emotional strings, and even plucks at the brain a little.	
 Excellent fare - Oscar material	Freeman's performance was excellent. The scene near the end with the parole board was priceless albeit a bit contrived. The predictable ending would have been more convincing had it been filmed in a less-remote location. Chances of Freeman's character finding that particular scene at that particular time was just not convincing. Nonetheless, too nice a film not to see again and again.	10
 greatest movie yet	This is the greatest movie of all time yet to be made.  If you have not seen this movie, consider yourself deprived.  You have not lived your life, until you view this movie.  Nuff said.	
 A new masterpiece!!!	"This movie, based on a short stoy by Stehpen King, is easily one on the best movies made in the modern era of Hollywood.  It incorporates a touching story of friends and hope, top-notch acting, excellent directing and most important; a screenplay worthy of high marks.  With beautiful photography and a story that is best described as ""uplifting"". this is one of my favorite movies EVER.  The best line in the movie goes ""it all comes down to one thing; get busy living or get busy dyin'"".  A rating of 10 out of 10 was given."	10
 I'm no expert	How many times have I seen this movie?God only knows! One thing is for sure though,apart from Dead Poets Society,this is the only film to still make me laugh,cry and when i've finished watching to somehow approach life in a more positive way. No.1 Film?I am no expert on cinema,i just know that people *need* to watch this film so that just for a little while all the s**t makes sense. Cheers for reading.	
 A terrific film with great insights!!!	This film was great - and that's a poor way to describe it. IT was fantastic!!! You see into the lives of Andy and Red and all the others in Shawshank. Not only do you gain insight as to how the prisoners live, but also how they work and live with one another, and how badly they are treated at times, by both fellow prisoners and by the guards. This movie also shows how that in some cases instead of preparing a prisoner for life back on the streets, prison will make them prepared for life only on the inside. The example of this is the elderly librarian prisoner. He has been in prison for many many years, and finally he is let out. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes a good prison movie or just one that seems to be real life.	10
 Truly stunning	I remembered reading Stephen King's original short story many moons before I saw the screen translation, but I'm very thankful that I couldn't remember the twist towards the end.  The discovery as to what Andy's posters were REALLY used for totally changes the feel of the film, and I defy anyone to be unmoved.This is easily the best King screen adaption, and is hardly likely to be bettered.  It really is excellent, and it's hard to know what to praise it for most, but it's perhaps the only film I've ever seen that made my heart soar at the fate of it's main characters as if they were real people.As I write this, The Shawshank Redemption has been voted the #1 film on IMDB, which is a very pleasing surprise as it really is deserved.	10
 Touching	One of the best films I´ve ever seen. In the end I cried like a baby. Don´t miss this excellent movie.	10
 Plot too thin		7
 Terribly underestimated	(Note: my English is not really superb!!!) This movie is absolutely one of the most underestimated movies ever. This great all-round performance has never gotten the recommendation it deserves. I was very happy to discover that I'm not the only one who's deeply touched by this movie. A deserved first place I think. And for everyone who hasn't seen it yet, and can appreciate real quality: you really have to see this one!!!	10
 With time and persistence, you can make it.	I just visited a prison museum in north China, which was a real prison used in early 1900s.  This movie reminds me of horrible dark room, sodomy, and brutal corporal punishment that actually can happen to you in the jail.Whether you are innocent or not, once you are IN the jail. You are all the same. Your are finished. But, Andy Dufresne(Tim Robbins) is not. With hope and his persistence, he escaped from jail after 20 years. Imagine to dig a big cement hole with the small stone hatchet! Amazing.Where there is a will, there is a way. This movie is encouraging.	
 You're never immune to this	I'm one of those repetitive mucks who'll watch the same movie every weekend for three months or until I feel I've had enough.  Shawshank is one of those films I have seen at least ten times and yet, it is still new.  The truth is, you're never really immune to the human drama portrayed by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, both excellent here. This is not a feel-good Friday night flick.  It's about injustice, desperation, the overcoming of that desperation, and the will to live regardless of time or circumstance. Shawshank set no records at the box office and was largely ignored until gradually, it was recognized as the masterpiece it undoubtedly is.  Roger Ebert attributes the movie's financial flop to its unassuming name.I noticed the film is right at the top of the IMDB's Top 250 films list, and rightfully so!!!  Some movies have one or two really glorious scenes.  But Shawshank is one continuing memorable scene.  There is not one line of stale dialogue or awkwardness.  I can't do it justice here, so do yourself a favor and rent it NOW.	
 A Masterpiece A Masterpiece		10
 How is this #1?	"At the time of this review, 'The Shawshank Redemption' is the number one movie on IMDb. Why? If anything, it is probably the most clichéd film I have ever seen with my own two eyes, and yet it is rated as the top film of all time? It blows my mind every time I visit this website.This 'film' was adapted from a novel by the renowned author Steven King. I have not read the book, as I have already been spoiled by the movie, but apparently the writing is quite exquisite. However, Frank Darabont must have missed the entire point of Steven's works, which is to have engaging characters that you are able to sympathize with.The characters are so bland, I might as well be staring at glue dry. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's bromance literally develops right out of the blue after they have one conversation. Pacing? What's that? Later, you meet an old fart named Brooks, who might as well have his name changed to ""I'm going to die later so feel sad-larry"", and the most he contributes to the film is increasing the runtime with his sub-plot about being outside after being locked in for so long. One cannot forget the oh-so-memorable (sarcasm) warden who channels the spirits of every Disney villain without the accompanying song. You can find more interesting characters in a Tyler Perry movie.The worst part of the movie is definitely the passage of time. The story takes place over twenty years or so and yet the only one to actually age is the warden. Tim and Morgan stay in some special cells where they magically do not get older and therefore nobody notices on IMDb. While a competent director would have noticed this as soon as they glanced at the script, Darabont was off in the broom closet shagging the catering chick or something.If you enjoy modern shooters then you are in for a treat. Most of this movie is full of grays, browns, mixes between, and it even has a sewer section just for the hell of it. Just when you thought the movie might get interesting when out of the prison, prepare to be disappointed. Honestly, the best shot of the movie is when Tim is crawling through sh*t, as it reflects on my feelings towards the film.Music can make - or break - a movie. Here, the 'original' score only seems to try and make you cry at the most inappropriate times. The music is too overplayed in films like this, where it takes away from the already terrible experience.This movie is as lame as they come. If you like this, fine. As the phrase says, ""ignorance is bliss""."	1
 if this film is #2 of all time, then i am Jesus Christ returning to burn this trash		1
 How could one movie be so terrible	***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen! I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe. In conclusion, I don't see how this movie even got the Best Picture nomination back in '94, I guess the Academy felt sorry for this film. You should either get busy livin' watching true classics that are below this film on the Top 250, or get busy dyin' watching this garbage.0/10	1
 Impossibly overrated	Don't get me wrong - I liked this movie just fine, I just don't understand how it deserves the *heaps* of rapturous praise it regularly receives from IMDb members, and the fact that is has been ranked at #2 in the hallowed IMDb Top 250 for the past 8 years or so just baffles me. It was certainly entertaining enough, and very well-acted, but also way over-long, and filled with the usual stock characters that seem to inhabit every prison drama (if Hollywood movies are to be believed, prison wardens are mainly just nasty SOB's and the inmates are just the best bunch of guys you'd ever want to meet). I'd recommend the movie as a good renter, but I guess I can't see it as any more than that. I realize I am way in the minority on this, however.	1
 No.	"This film deserves something like a 7 or an 8, but I have been forced to score it drastically in some attempt to right the terrible injustice that has been done.WHO is voting this film so highly? It is a nice film. A NICE film. IT IS NOT THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!! I can only assume it has been voted as such because people liked the ""shocking"" ending and the happiness brought to them by Morgan Freeman's voice caressing their ears.There is also a seriously unpleasant rape scene in there, none of the characters do very much, and there is a particularly depressing suicide scene. How any of this makes for 9.3/10, I have no idea. Can people stop giving films ridiculous ratings, so that people like me have to counterbalance those (undeserved) ratings with mean ones? Please? Just say no."	1
 Overblown	"I was inflicted The Shawshank Redemption in a school trip coach, where a shy girl handed the tape to the headteacher : ""Sir please sir ! Can we watch it ?"". And we did, gosh, we did.  And heard it as well. Spoilers ahead ! A very noisy film - overblown, cheesy, sappy, with ugly slow-motions to make you understand that, hurray, at last the characters are free (and so was I, mercifully), and the bad ones have been punished (and so was I, and so was I...) Yes, at last that does make sense... Next the students asked for Meet the parents - and - would you believe it ? Ben Stiller WAS a relief. Since that moment I've always wanted to watch Zoolander."	1
 A must see movie	It has been argued for years whether this movie deserves its fame or not. Some say that it is overrated and others say that it is the best movie ever made. What I can say is that it is true that this movie is a bit overrated but it still deserves to be called a masterpiece.There is something about The Shawshank Redemption that creates a specific atmosphere and makes you not only watch but experience it. I have read the book and I have to admit that I enjoyed the movie more. The combination of outstanding acting, great directing and well written script makes this movie the masterpiece it is.I really don't have anything bad to say about this movie except for its high place in the IMDB top 250's list. It is an amazing movie but it still doesn't deserve to be called the best as there are many others that are equally good or even better. But still, this movie should be on everyone's list of must watch movies.	9
 This movie shouldn't be rated so high.	Shawshank Redemption is a good movie with great actors, a decent director, wonderful music and a very obvious plot. I think the movie would have been between mediocre and failure were it not for Robbins and Freedman.Its ranking on the IMDb top 250 is a shame. It shouldn't be on a list with other such high caliber films as the Godfather and Gone With the Wind. I think that the re-release of the DVD is the cause of its illogical high-standing.Don't get me wrong. Its a good movie its just not as good as people say. Worth watching especially if your a fan of either of the main actors.7 out of 10	7
 Above average, but not great.		6
 Voted by my son's UCLA film program class as most overrated film ever	Really this film is simply a string of cliches and is mediocre in every way.	
 Ripe off of Escape From Alcatraz		1
" Weak copy of ""Escape from Alcatraz"""	"This movie is clearly a weak copy of ""Escape from Alcatraz""(1979) The scene where Andy drops the grit is directly and without any effort from Frank Darabont to hide the fact that he has little fantasy, copied from Escape from Alcatraz. The sphere that is created in The Shawshank Redemption is meek whereas the sphere that is created in Escape from Alcatraz is thrilling and you can really feel the tension in the prison. The closed ending of this movie is for people, like Frank Darabont, that have little fantasy. The sublime open ending in Escape from Alcatraz leaves room for the viewer to fantasize on what happened to the prisoners."	1
 Racquel Welch's gaping plot hole.	"This film is story driven rather than character driven which means it'll always be liked by people but will never be one of the all-time greats. I have no problem with the plot design - it's well assembled and effectively climaxed. Overall, a well thought out entertaining film. The dialogue and characterisation devices however were cheesy and untrue to the world of the story.1)The new inmates line up for a speech from the warden. One inmate growls: ""When do we eat?"". Unrealistic and unnecessary. He might well have said: ""Please hit me several times so the audience can see how brutal this prison is."" The brutality of the prison is conveyed when crying fat boy gets kicked to death, so this addition is pointless.2)The story had already established freemans and robbins friendship, when freeman leans over to robbins and says: ""We're kinda becomin friends aren't we?"" Can you ever imagine any grown adult actually saying that to another?3)Worst scene of the film: the music scene. The film uses music to symbolise the theme of hope (robbins mind music in the hole, freemans harmonica). This is first introduced when robbins locks himself in the office and blares loud music all over the prison. Yeah OK, willful main character. But when the warden and guards shout for him to turn it off, what does he do? He sits back with feet up and smug grin plastered on his face. The guards bang again and again. What does he do? He leans over to the gramaphone and turns the volume up. I mean, come on, do me a favour. His punishment is a month in the hole, and for a simple reason. If the scriptwriter had shown the guards breaking in and kicking him almost to death (which is what really would have happened), then the audience is left thinking: ""What a fool"". The scene was silly and should've been rethought.Finally, can someone please tell me how he got that poster of Racquel Welch back on the wall after he climbed frontways into that tunnel?I give it an 8 out of 10."	1
 No redemption for pitiful movie	"This movie is more of a drama than action, but that doesn't matter, because it would fail in either case. A viewer can accept the cliché of the wrongly convicted man, but this case is deceptively against the grain. Our society already has a predisposition to acquit any man of murdering his wife, a predisposition to think it is impossible, when the statistics claim the opposite. For that reason alone, this movie is dangerous propaganda, and most often a lie. The characters never become believable, mostly because of the reason stated earlier. Also, because such men don't wind up in prison. The wrongly convicted man always comes from a different background and class. I can't imagine someone finding this movie even remotely plausible. In fact, the viewer has no idea what the ""redemption"" is. Nothing makes any sense."	2
 Overrated	What is this movie is doing in the top ten? Its a good movie. By good I mean - you go to see it and you walk out saying - that was a good movie. Then you may watch it again because you remember enjoying it the first time. On the third viewing you are beginning to tire of it and the characters seem more contrived and you begin to see how the script has some flaws. Still - all and all - its better than most. A great movie (and there are many) is a movie that no matter how many times you watch it you marvel at the script - the performances - the music - all the things we love about the movies. The Shawshank Redemption doesn't come close. Well made, good performances, but not great and not deserving of being on ANY top ten movie list of all time.	5
 Cheap bigotry	"Tim Robbins smirks his way through this cheap rip-off of the >""Count of Monte Cristo"". The anti-Christian bigotry is too much >to stomach -- the murderous warden wears a cross, thumps a Bible >and utters fundamentalist platitudes. Morgan Freeman is very >solid tho"	1
 Horribly unrealistic characters	This is quite far from being the best movie of all time. The characters are black and white in true blockbuster tradition. Everybody is either all good or all evil, and do not at all feel real. The plot is unoriginal (although it has a surprise ending, that's hardly original scriptwriting) The film is extremely cliche-ridden, and I don't recommend it to anyone who appreciate truly great films like the three colors trilogy etc.	2
 A litmus test for liberals?		1
 Average film, marred by Hollywood clichés	I still cannot understand this films continued high regard. Yes, it's a good drama and the acting is pretty solid if unspectacular. But it is the most sickly saccharine and clichéd movie I have ever scene, which often throws logic straight out of the window.The depiction of prison life is pretty ridiculous. Different races all getting on fine, apart from the small group of 'bad guys'. The ending is absolutely awful. If it had ended with red getting released it would have been marginally better. However, to do the typical Hollywood thing of explaining exactly what happens is just rubbish. Note to Hollywood, we can use our brains! I think this film is 2nd in the IMDb Top 250, can someone please explain why? It's a very average film and be warned it will make you sick with its cheesiness!	5
 Clichéd prison movie - why is this at number 2???	When I first saw this movie in 1994, before the hype, I thought it was a passable flick; nothing special and certainly in keeping with the usual schmaltz expected from any non-horror Stephen King work. In fact, with the exception of Morgan Freeman's excellent performance, I found it imminently forgettable. Then, lo, came the Academy Awards with a surprising nomination for Best Picture. Then, even worse, came the belated hype from its legion of fans. I could not understand this adoration of a movie that was as sugar-coated as that other saccharine movie of 94, Forrest Gump. Worse than Gump's unpalatable cuteness, however, was Shawshank's genre clichés: the rape scene, the prisoner's pet, etc. Had no-one seen Escape From Alcatraz or Birdman of Alcatraz? For me, Shawshank is possibly the most overrated film ever made, a fact emphasised by its place at No. 2 in the IMDb top 250.	4
 One of the greatest mediocre films ever made	I really can't explain why this movie does absolutely nothing for me.  It has a great cast that turns in some good performances, and the story is compelling; however, I always feel so empty after I see it.  I get a similar vibe from FORREST GUMP and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT, to name a couple others. I can't really figure out why.	5
 I don't hate this movie - I hate the Fan-base	"In the early '80's, Stephen King read a short story by Leo Tolstoy called God sees the truth, but waits - a man falsely accused of murder is incarcerated and over the course of decades grows to be well liked and respected by the other inmates, and eventually someone shows up at the prison who can prove his innocence. Sound familiar? King promptly ripped it off and re-packaged it as Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. The main difference being that in the Russian original the dude dies in prison while waiting for his release papers to be processed whereas Stephen King had to rewrite it to give it the cheap cheesy family feel-good Disney ending that Americans have been trained to expect from everything.Darabont substitutes melodrama for an actual pulse: Like the scene where Andy crawls through a quarter-mile of Diarrhea and comes out clean on the other side, oh Lordy Hallelujah all things are possible in America! (Jazz hands). And I hate to seem like nitpicking, but if you're gonna crawl through a tightly enclosed tube in a quarter-mile of s**t, you will either pass out from the unbearable fumes and drown in diarrhea, or at the very least, have your lungs filled with fecal matter and experience some severe adverse health effects, but no, Andy is perfectly fine because that's how that scenario would totally play out. Or the ending when Red is finally released from prison - ""Oh I hope I get to see my friend again oh I hope the sea is as blue as I remember"" - And then they meet on the beach and live happily ever after because that's how prison goes -- Thug Life.The movie is indistinguishable from anything else - It does nothing new - no new techniques, story structure, presentation. It is your standard, typical, by-the-book story. There is nothing to distinguish its direction - you could've replaced Darabont with Spielberg or Zemeckis and it would've come out about the same. There is nothing to distinguish it visually - You could've replaced Roger Deakins with another big name and it would've come out more or less the same. It could've been made by any director specializing in over-sentimentality, shot by nearly anyone, produced by anyone, there are no unique or distinguishable fingerprints on it."	5
 Great movie	I really liked this movie.. it really was good and interesting	7
 Get Busy Livin' or Get Busy Trying to Analyze This Film		4
 A Prison Story that will leave you wanting...		
 The Shawshank Redemption = Masterpiece		10
 Unrealistic, I'll tell you why!!!	Spoiler!! How can an overglorified view of prison be so widely accepted. I thought we as a movie going audience had got over the romance of films such as escape from alcatraz. Its the same film. Shy white guy befriends black guy. White guy escapes. Black guy is happy. Everyone who voted high for this should watch Animal Factory by Steve Buscemi. It isnt a great film but it offers a far more powerful realistic look into penitentiary life than Shawshank. kev	6
 #2?	"I like ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" but cannot understand why it is rated so highly.  While it's well-acted, the direction is pedestrian, and the story is derivative.While it should be somewhere in the top 250, rating it above movies like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" ""The Seven Samurai,"" ""Chinatown,"" ""Memento,"" etc. strikes me as ludicrous."	7
 Good but overrated...	"My impression is that since the early ninenties and especially  after ""green fried tomatoes"" was released movies regarding human relations and/or tragedy and using narative as their spine became fashionable..Countless movies followed that i dont care to mention most of them inferior than the original they tried to follow and one of them is Shawshank redemption.Sure it is not a mellow love story but about life in prison that is objectively hard.But somehow the typical ingredients are there.The film is mostly sad and melodramatic and one can even consider it romantic in a way.Despite its strong cast and a good storyline it does not avoid all these characteristic cliches that sadly deprive it from any real replay value.Rent it on dvd and you wont be disapointed by viewing it but the second best movie of all times it aint and you will know this because you wont feel the need to watch it now and then as it happens at least to me  with movies that are really classics...Not a bad movie but highly overrated....3 out of five stars."	6
 Overrated.	Perfectly fine yarn, but those who are ranking it among the all-time greatest movies need to see some more flicks. The cliches are pretty heavy at times, and the moral of the story seems to be freedom _isn't_ a mental state, after all.	6
 A film of Eloquence	I figured prison life to be much harsher, as seen in other films.  This is the films only weak point, but then the story would suffer if the film was like Fight club.  This is a story about a man who loses everything but still survives.  He uses his intelligence to outwit his attackers, and function in prison.  No matter what happens he still kept his dreams alive.  What is a man without dreams?  The word institutionalized is used in this film to describe what the prison does to the individual. Tim Robbins will not have the inner freedom of who he is change to what the prison dictates.  There are many interesting subplots that keeps the viewer's attention.  These subplots culminate into a unforgettable conclusion.	8
 Well-polished cliches		6
 Greatest film of all time. Artistic perfection. Best music I've ever heard in a film.	This is the greatest film ever made.  Everyone already knows that.  (If you haven't seen it, you are missing out on one of the greatest experiences you will ever have). I could write for hours about the masterful direction, the acting which challenged perfection, the incredible writing, etc., but I wanted to point something out that others seemed to have missed. This film boasts the best music I have ever heard in a film. Whoever wrote the music deserves the credit of being the man, in my opinion, who made this film what it is.  I'm actually studying music as my major in college, with film as my minor.  So I just wanted to tell everyone to notice the music next time you watch this film, and you will have a much more enjoyable experience. Every person who contributed to this film is brilliant and I worship everyone who had anything to do with this film.	10
 Whats the big fuss??	Cannot see why this film is rated so highly.  Sure, its watchable and nicely inoffensive, but its not really about much, and nothing really happens. Just a film about a bloke going to prison.  Somewhere along the line I think I must have missed something, because I can think of at least a hundred better films.  Saying that, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are flawless, though the latter's best film will always be the Hudsucker Proxy.  (Which incidentally is a better film.)	6
 The best movie ever made!	The acting is top-notch, the dialogue is superb, and even the cinematography only serves to highlight the first two.  This movie never fails to bring a tear to my eye.  The tears start about 10 minutes before the ending in anticipation.  I've never used this word to describe a movie before, but it is beautiful.	10
 The only movie that made me cry	Towards the end, dealing with Freeman's loneliness, I felt how he was feeling. These are believable criminals. People say these guys are too nice to be hard-core criminals, but people make mistakes. The guys' mistakes were on a big-time scale. One line will remain with me forever : Get busy livin, or get busy dying.Well, Get busy watching or get busy goin';	10
 Without a doubt, one of the best films ever made	"So there I was, relaxing one Sunday evening in front of the TV.  Suddenly an advert for ""The Shawshank Redemption"" appeared - it was on in an hour on Channel 4 (fourth out of five for you non-Brits).  I thought, ""Hey, I remember that film.  It's number one in the IMDB ratings.""  I always wondered why - I remember watching it a few years ago and thinking it was pretty good.  So I thought I would sit myself down and watch the thing properly...  Thank God I did.  That film is absolutely fantastic.  I sat rivetted for the full two and bit hours of it.  The sheer complexity of the plot, the twists, the character development.  The ending.  You can sort of understand why it got nominated for so many Oscars.  As I mentioned earlier I always wondered why this film seems to have spent most of its time at the top of the IMDB chart - not Star Wars, the Godfather, Citizen Kane even. Now I know.  I suppose most of the people who have read this far would know how good this film is - but if not, here's my advice.  Watch this film!"	10
 A hyped film, for my opinion	Well, after all the glory this film has had, I decided to watch it. And for my opinion, it wasn't that great. Was it the hype, I don't know..I just didn't like that much to esteem the movie as #2 in IMDb top 250 list. It was just as boring as Stephen King's book are. Afer all, acting was great, I have no bad things say about that, it's only a bad script, for my opinion. Nowadays, when there's such realistic prison descriptions, as OZ and Prison break, this one doesn't give the spark. For a good prison movie I reckon the following: If you wanna see a good prison movie, you should watch ' Blood In Blood Out ', If you haven't had a chance already. Now, there's a reality check and a great movie, which haven't lost it's best-before date, like this one has.	2
 Pretty boring stuff	"I have no idea, why this movie has received such a good rating. It´s an average prison movie without any highlights. Typical Hollywood stuff. There are hundreds of better movies around. The movie drags, the actors are average. It´s just this typical ""heartbreaking"" stuff and far away from other movies up on this list."	2
 Theatrically beautiful, yet thematically shallow		1
 I am so sorry to who likes this movie but...	It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Out of my top 5 worst movies this would be in at least the top 3 movies I hate. It is just so boring and everytime I turn on TNN or something it is on! By far one of the worst movies ever!	1
 Enjoyable but vastly overrated		
 A Very Good Movie....However	I have seen this movie and think it is very good, Tim Robbins is really good in it and Morgan Freeman as usual is great. It has a lot of original ideas and is deserving of much praise, however i really feel it lacks something that The Godfathers 1 and 2 have. They are just a different caliber of movie no offense to it, its very good. However Al Pacino in both of those films is as close to perfect of a performance as you will ever get. I really feel because it is 35 years old so many people of todays generation has not seen it, I am 20 and own all three and can appreciate the talent by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in the first film and Al in the second with Francis Ford Coppola directing both. I understand that when someone sees a movie and they would like to rate it on this site its difficult to see all the other movies on the top 250, but when you are dealing with the top 5 its not that hard, see those movies and then judge.	1
 The best prison movie ever filmed	"Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were splendid in this look at the horrors of prison life. Great camera work, acting, and a believable script led to a realistic feeling movie. This is only the second King book that made a good film; ""The Stand"" being the other."	10
 Morgan Freeman is the only great thing in this movie	Satisfying, good movie, but the only great part of this movie is the magnificent performance by Morgan Freeman. An apparently inspired Tim Robbins rises above his very mediocre talent and delivers an adequate performance. Ham-handed attempts at profundity in every scene get tiring as is the use of every prison movie device, character, and cliche in the history of hollywood.	3
 Overrated crap!	This and the Fight Club and two of the most overrated movies I have ever seen. Sure this is nice- got lots of nice talk, nice interracial bonding in a prison, lots of sub stories about a crappy Warden etc. Sure its got a plan to get out, plan that ultimately fruitions but come on- people talk like this is Jesus's Second Coming or whatever. This is cliché driven drivel of the highest order. Spend your 2 hours elsewhere.	1
 The Shawshank Redemption	"-Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	1
 This movie bites!	"Okay so many people may be wondering why I hate such a ""beautiful work of literature"" or ""The best story ever told on screen"". Well there are too many reasons to list in my maximum of 1,000 words. So instead I will give a few obvious reasons on why I truly hate this movie. Being a teenager I enjoy movies like ""Mystic River"" and ""Donnie Darko"". You know psychological thrillers. Well this is nothing of the sort. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is what I classify as a Sleeping movie. The name says it all. You sleep while you watch it. It took me about a month to get through the whole entire movie. That is very sad considering the praise this movie received. I pray no one else ever has to go through the torture of watching this horrid movie."	1
 Absolutely awful!	"This movie was an incredible disappointment. I came into watching this movie looking for some deep introspective storytelling, and all I got was a pile of steaming feces. Now one major disappointment (spoilers ahead), was that the characters didn't make ANY fart jokes. Not even once! Now you may call this childish, but I believe that fart jokes are the pinnacle of introspective, existential comedy that really elevates the themes of a plot to another level. Instead, all the jokes fell flat and didn't really make me think about the deep universal consequences of flatulence. Another major complaint was the cast. Yes, I know this is something I cannot change, but I believe the cast would have much better if instead of Morgan Freeman, they cast incredible method actor Dylan Sprouse as Red. I believe Mr. Sprouse would have taken the character of Red to the next level instead of the flat, one dimensional character that Mr. Freeman ""acted"" as (if you would call that acting). The one high point in this movie was the large amount of diversity. I was really happy seeing an Asian, lesbian character as the main character. That kind of diversity is what Hollywood needs. My only wish is that she would be played by a more versatile actor, like Jared Leto or Ashely Tisdale. Overall, this was a disappointment of a movie, and really did not merit the awards it got."	1
 Overrated Hollywood Garbage.	The scene where Tim Robbins crawls through 2 football fields of shits sums up what watching this movie feels like. The fact that this movie is top of the IMDb top 250 list is a sign that people on this site have no concept of good film making outside of the standard Hollywood fare. The movie may well be enjoyable, but in the end it is no more than that, enjoyable, and that is pushing it. The director's involvement with other movies outside of this speak volumes: Green Mile is in a similar mould,whilst The Mist shows his continued obsession with Stephen King. With writing credits on over five different mutations of Young Indiana Jones's, his incompetence is evident. At the end of the day, a Hollywood remake by M. Night Shyamalan of this would probably be more satisfying, and that's saying something.	1
 Number One?	"Really now. I can't say that this is the worst movie of all time, but it certainly isn't the greatest. The mere fact that TBS plays this movie sixteen times per week, thereby forcing you to watch it over and over again, does not mean that it is good. I therefore, call for a ""surge"" of negative reviews to be leveled against this mediocre film so that with the help of Mark Twain and his angels we will be able to oust it from its ill-deserved spot as IMDb #1 movie of all time. Honestly, my fellow Americans, this film is the kind of thing that makes us look bad.Merry Christmas, and to all a good night."	1
 simply retarded	I saw this film only once and I immediately started to hate it from the very beginning. The director did a horrible job on creating this piece of crap! Whoever watched this piece of crap is just weird!! Hopefully nobody has to go through the pain that I had to go through because the only reason that I watched the movie is because at my house we have a movie night and it so happens that the movie my family and me watched this crap!! I wanted to go up-stairs and watch a movie on my TV but my mom said no, so because of that I had to watch crap!! I am sorry to anybody who liked this film but it was just plain retarded. Do not be offended if I upset your feelings though!! Sorry!!	5
 !BORING!	I do not know, what to say, I am just bored. Many people say that is the best Movie? False	3
 Seriously, its not THAT good	After seeing how high it was on 'best film' lists I thought it must be something great, unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. Sure, it was a touching story, great actors and of course a great ending, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Shawshank Redemption was visually boring and seemed to drag on for hours and hours without reaching any type of plot until three quarters into the film, and the plot itself was pretty unrealistic, sorry but what are the chances of him meeting a man, who knows the man who really killed his wife? ...unlikely. I must admit, its not a bad film and i'd watch it again just for the ending, which I didn't see coming at all. But I still can't get my head round why anybody would consider this 'the best film of all time' because it most certainly isn't.	4
 An overrated and less believable take-off of Cool Hand Luke	"This is supposed to be better than every movie but The Godfather? Well, maybe I could think more positively about it without such ridiculous comparisons, but this is an average movie at best. I guess my biggest problem with it is that it is so completely far-fetched. You have a few characters supplied solely to provide the ""sad"" moments, and everything else is just built up to provide a fulfilling and completely happy ending. Now I'm no prison warden, but I would look behind my tenant's posters (more in case they've tunneled into each other's rooms for a little lights-out action).Anyway, as I thought about it more, the movie started to remind me of another classic prison flick, Cool Hand Luke. Unfortunately for Shawshank, Tim Robbins is no Paul Newman, and whatever stiff played the warden is no Struther Martin. Perhaps more importantly, though, is the way in which Cool Hand Luke presents a much more believable series of events, with no fairy tale ending. Luke's omission of the whole prison-love thing is even forgivable thanks to the inclusion of a classic car wash scene. One does not need a prisoner who happened to be roommates with a prisoner who happened to kill the wife of a man who happens to be a prisoner to create drama. It's a truth Shawshank dearly needs to learn."	5
 Voter Fraud!	This movie provides positive proof that the IMDb website has security holes. Somehow the family members of the filmmakers hacked the system to grossly inflate the votes for this movie. How else to explain the No. 2 ranking of a film that probably does not belong in the Top 2000? It is an entertaining prison yarn but there are at least twenty prison movies that are superior to this and the filmmakers had the good sense to borrow from these (I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang, The Great Escape, Cool Hand Luke, etc.). In fact, the same director's The Green Mile, which is also based on a Stephen King story and set in a prison, is a better film. On the acting front, Robbins and Freeman are always watchable.	7
 ~Get busy watching decent movies or get busy believin the hype~	"I'd heard so much about this film, everyone who told me about it, sang its praises. My ex boyfriend said he'd cried at the end. It's even ranked #2 in imdb's top 250 movies. So you can imagine that as I settled down to watch this film, I was expecting something out of the ordinary. Unfortunately for me, it was *very* ordinary. Ok sure, there's some great twists and some parts keep you on the edge of your seat. But the pace was slow and dragged in parts, *SPOILER* just like Andy's possesions when he escapes. A few rare films I've watched, American Beauty for example, have made me go ""wow"" afterwards and stayed with me long after the film has finished. Due to all the hype, I was expecting to feel the same after watching ""Shawshank"" but all I feel is that most of the film is instantly forgettable and cheesy. I suspect that most of the people who have rated this film a 9 or 10 haven't had the opportunity to see many films that haven't had the ""Hollywood"" conveyor belt behind them. My advice to them is to give smaller, low budget films a watch. You may be pleasantly surprised."	6
 pretty, but...	I thought Shawshank was a gorgeous movie, wonderfully shot with beautiful production design. That said, I have a hard time watching the film. It drags-on for too long. I think the filmmakers were aiming for deep-thought provoking pacing, but I just got bored. The film moves slowly just so you can see how beautiful it is; personally, pretty pictures are not enough for me.	6
 Overlength Weakens Promising Production	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" has so much skill which went into the production that it is regrettable that it's overlength undermines its attributes. Episodic, slack and slow formatting stretch the narrative far beyond what its material requires. The result is a fair film, with some worthy touches."	4
 Everything rings false	Why this film is so highly rated is beyond me. First of all, where is the redemption? The characters do nothing that can be construed as redeeming (except for the one played by Gil Bellows). They simply survive. Someone who also doesn't like the film compares it to a fairy tale because it's unrealistic. This is an insult to fairy tales. Fairy tales are beautiful and deep, with complex motives transmitted throughout the centuries, the traditional good-bad dichotomy and a clear moral conclusion. The Shawshank Redemption is dull, with some basic and carefully explained symbolism (because apparently we're too stupid to get it otherwise) and, contrary to traditional notions of morality, the hero's sidekicks are some nice criminals. Of course, prison staff are cast as the bad guys and their boss is portrayed as a hypocrite speaking of the Bible yet acting in an un-Christian manner. Can you say anti-Christian bigotry?	1
 a bad movie		1
 Amazing?	Hi guys everyone. My rate is 9 point. I don't understand to the best film is this. This film is very well but I watched more good films than this film. I think raters are stupid.	9
 Cool	This is movie is too lit cool killing and anything u can think of	9
 King is one of the best...	King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.	7
 nice	Good this is actually a lovely movie could watch it 1000times again	7
 Awesome!	One of the best movies of all time!I watch it every time I see it on TV.	10
 some birds aen´t meant to be caged	"The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them."	9
 Best Prison Movie	If you like crime or prison films watch this. Has the highest film rating on IMDB (2020 February).	10
 you should definitely watch a great movie	I can say that it was the most beautiful movie I have watched. I watched it many years ago and I can't write anything other than saying great. If you do not watch it, I recommend you watch it immediately. I could not stop without writing a comment	10
 Quite simply the greatest movie ever made!	Injustice, betrayal, friendship, hope, love, brotherhood, loyalty, revenge, justice, this movie has it all 10/10	10
 One of the best movies of all time	Anytime this movie is showing on any channel I must watch it- in fact, I've lost count of how many times I've watched this.What an amazing movie, that puts life into perspective. A true masterpiece that sits amongst the classics in my books.	10
 I love this thing	That was the best film I ever seen. Thanks for all, I just can't stop crying	10
 A masterpiece no doubt, but..	You may think 10/10 is a given, but the way I see it 10/10 is perfection. This movie is NOT perfect. It relies too much on the ending. The first 2 hours of the movie ( great as it is ) is lacking complexity. The remaining 20 minutes fools you into thinking it's the best movie ever made. But I am here to tell you It's NOT!I love this movie with all my heart but I just don't think it deserves the number one spot.	9
 Congrats	Nice film, all of this comment its just needed to activate my account i guess.	7
 No	No thanks this movie sucks æalalalslslslslslslsldkfkgkgkgkgjgkgkgj	10
 One of the greatest films ever.	I love this film to bits, even though it can be hard to watch.	10
 Stinky	I don't get why this movie is so beloved... Seemed very cliche and predictable. Maybe it's a 90's thing?	4
 Amazing film !	Don't miss it! Such an amazing acting, extraordinary screenplay and what not?go ahead and watch it guys.	9
 BEAUTIFUL VERSION OF THE STORY	It gets better the original story of Sthepen King. Amazing adaptation.	9

 THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER	What can i say...all these reviews speak for themselves...	10
 Really Great Movie Must Watch	No words needed to describe this movie everything is composed really beautifull just watch	9
 Hope is a dangerous thing!	Did you notice that the supporting actor (Morgan Freeman) had a lot more lines than the main actor (Tim Robins)?this movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.it was about how hope can shape our way of living and our purposes in life.it was about how easily we get used to our life( Brooks) how stupid little things can make our day and we almost never notice them(the scene that Andy was playing the Italian music in the office) and the most important lesson that this movie taught me was when Andy realized that he became a criminal after when he got into prison!truly beautiful!	10
 Great	This film is a really good. Stephen King is a great author.	10
 Best cult movie	This is the worlds best movie. Never seen any other beautifull movie than this one. Best acting and story. Must watch movie	10
 :D	Any movie narrated by morgan freeman is a sure hit	10
 Dayum	This is the kind of bad  that I'll still watch after 30 years.	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	When I watched this movie for the first time I knew anything about the movie, but I had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, I saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor.	10

Thrill that I have experienced in the end doesn't match with any of the actions films that I have ever watched in my entire life.	10
 great movie	Best movie Ive ever seen...and i love it so very much	10
 I dont care about it but its a good relaxing movie!	I dont know whats so special about this movie that made people idolize it but i have to admit: Its well written, directed, acted with a nice relaxing music that surrounds this story. It is a good movie that you can see again and again but its not the ultimate inspiration for me and it didn't touch my soul. I give high rating though because of all the above i stated.	9
 Simply amazing!!!	This is a great example of how a great movie should look like. A very good story, perfectly played characters. My favourite movie of all time.	10
 Great movie!	The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul.	5
 Thanks	A very good description about a realistic film.Long will be in the first place	
 Excellent	One of the best films I've ever seen is a masterpiece.	10
 rtc	The Cost of Bondage tells the stories of the world that two prisoners, Andy and Red, set up behind bars. Andy Dufresne is a young and successful banker. He is tried for the murder of his wife and his lover and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Shawsank Prison beatings, torture, rape, all kinds of situations are happening, but Andy is committed to life and optimistic. This attitude shows the people around him. When Andy opens his hopeful perspective, he convinces all prisoners that your bars are a bile-free life. Andy will also have a friend who will partner with these bubbles: Red. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an adaptation of Stephen King, starring the film. In 1995, the film was nominated for seven Oscar nominations, including the best film nomination	9
 why do they call your red its because i,m Irish	Saw this film and it was excellent entertainment i liked brooks and felt sorry him when he was released as he had became institutionalized and he had only seen a car once and now life is also busy and he ends up in a shop packing bags for customers and his manager is a bit of a to him well i wont tell you what happens if you have never seen the movie before anyway the rest is about a convicted banker who has been detained for 30 years after killing his wife and lover but there is more to the story then this its just about folk trying get by on a day to day basis in prison and having to put up with sadistic guards and other prisoners who want to jump you at any chance in more ways then one	10
 This movie is so nice	This movie is an amazing movie. It's not comparable . Friendship is an amazing thing.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption - Stunningly beautiful - 10		10
 Always been a fav	We watch this when its on tv but i notice where they take out certain words so if you see it watch it on dvd! This is one of those movies that make you feel like you live with the characters and that's why the end is so redeeming to watch.	10
 Kinda overrated but good	Shawshank Redemption was directed by Frank Darrabont,was written by Stephen King ,was played by Tim Robinns,Bob Gunton,Morgan Freeman and more.It tells you the story of banker and his pal in prison,the movie teaches you about frendship,how prisoners conditions are,prison life,how can sometimes guards,managers and court officers get even more cruel than actual prisoners,and prison it self.It's a really touching and inspring movie,but it's really obvious why this movie even didn't win any oscars,because in same year there were Léon,Lion King,Pulp Fiction,Forrest Gump and Ed Wood.I think this is a really great movie,but I don't think it's the best movie of all time.Acting was OK.Cinematography was OK too.Directing was good.Script was wonderful.Most of the people love this movie because of the script that's the reason I liked this movie too.I would give this movie:90/100	9
 Its ok	I like the movie and its ok, it isnt that much my taste but it was fun watching it	5
 ?	Dont get why is this greatest here, lol okbut i mean it is a movie after all	4
 Best ever	What can someone say about this one that isn't already said!	10
 Best movie ever	This is how movies should be made, this is such a great movie and I will recommend to everyone.	6
 Hello	I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.	10
 Awsome	This is just world class!! The acting is brilliant, the story is brilliant and the time went to fast. Seen it lots of times	9
 Really good film	You cant really critasis this film, it's a good all rounder and a hard hitting story line	8
 peace full movie	Superb movie , good relaxation movie, climax is too good , movie goes very realistically,awesome movie	10
 Truly the greatest prison movie ever!	So worth seeing in the theater thanks to fathom events and 25th anniversary plus Stephen King turned 72 recently! I admit I've been on the fence about enjoying Shawshank Redemption for a while but seeing it in the theater and re watching after not seeing it for a long time, I cried, I laughed, felt sympathy, and was very immersed.Truly remarkable and well deserving of every good opinion even after I was on the fence about it, I love the movie a lot now; Tim Robbins embodied such a glorious character! Frank Darabont made such a crafty, dark and heart wrenching experience! Fathom events is excellent, I am glad I paid over $13 dollars to see such drama perfected film.	10
 amazing film	I've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.	10
 Incredible	I should have watched this one many many years ago, when I heard of it for the first time.This movie is amazing!	10
 One of the best movies in history	A classic movie that you can watch over and over again. Brilliant performances by all actors and actresses.	10
 Pure Hollywood fantasy	It is the performances that stand out in an overlong, sentimental and cliche film. The acting in this film is nearly flawless. Tim Robbins' understated performance is outstanding and Morgan Freeman is his equal. But to what end. Acting alone can not save a film that is overlong, (It feels like a 20 year sentence) has a hokey plot and cliche characters. Bob Gunton's insufferable Warden Norton and Clancy Brown's Captain Hadley, are as cliche as you can get. The Shawshank Redemption is a typical sentimental Hollywood fantasy, that takes itself way too seriously. As opposed to some of the more lighthearted and brisk Hollywood fantasies, which are far more easier to sit through..	5
 My review		10
 Amazingly Powerful Story!	The Shawshank Redemption is amazingly powerful story about two friends life in prison. The characters Andy and Red are fundamentally good men in a hostile environment. This is a quietly narrated movie, by Red (Morgan Freeman) and gives an up close, raw depiction of lives served in prison and the ongoing trials of several inmates. This film is a compelling story of redemption.	10
 Nothing but Greatness!!	A film which has every emotion packed in. Tim Robbins is fantastic. Morgan freeman is the typical Morgan Freeman, amazing actor who is in my eyes an all time great which we will not see the likes of again.Mark Rolston(Alien, Rush Hour, Lethal weapon) and Bob Gumpton(Patch Adams, Broken Arrow, Ace Ventura) play the bad guys you hate to love.The Shawshank redemption is a film that can be shown in cinemas till the end of time and will sell every showing.	10
 A movie that will stand the test of time.	A story about friendship and hope. Every minute of this movie will keep you intrigued and wanting more, a movie you will never want to finish. There are two movies to me that are perfect 10's, Goodfellas and Shawshank Redemption. Enjoy.	10
 Cleverest Film Ever Made	"This is the cleverest film ever made. Clever is defined as something that is marked by wit or ingenuity. Throughout the film there are numerous clever moments. Warden's arrest for example is one of these moments. As he hears the police sirens he looks over to the safe. The camera pushes into the knitted sign covering the safe (where he keeps his criminal acts) that reads"" His judgment cometh and that right soon..."" Warden opens the safe and takes out the bible inside (Andy's bible). There is a note written by Andy inside reading ""You were right, salvation lay within."" Warden opens the book and it is revealed that this is the location Andy kept his rock axe to escape. Within lays salvation...The simple decision to not show the jail break until after it happens would be something Hitchcock would look down upon. This decision reduces any suspense this scene may have. Yet for this film it is so fitting. This decision highlights the cleverness of the escape rather then the escape itself. By having Red narrator the escape we realize how Andy had this planned the entire time right under our noises. And boy is the escape clever! Every thing Red says makes sense within the story. Right down to Andy asking Red to bring Rita Hayworth to him. The film cleverly sets everything up so that the escape is more satisfying. It's almost as if the film itself is written and directed by Andy Dufresne, one of the cleverest movie characters ever written. The structure of the film keeps you invested by the simple cleverness of it. It is constantly switching conflicts while all building to the third act of the film, the main conflict.The direction and cinematography is pure cinema. The entire film is visual storytelling. Even when Red narrates he adds new information but it is all reinforced by the brilliant visuals. This film has so many moments that only the cinema can truly capture. For example, the scene where Andy plays the Italian record to the inmates over the intercom. Only cinema can capture the awe and mysterious trance this music has on the inmates who haven't listened to music for years. With the elegant words of Red mixed with the stunning visuals of an entire court yard of people stopping what they are doing and looking up, we see the hope, something most of them lost, twinkle in their eyes.I remember the first time I saw this film. My Dad told me this was his favorite movie, yet he would not show it to me until I was older because of some of the violent scenes. That didn't stop me, one day I secretly watched the film when he wasn't home. The film blew my mind, it was one of the first times I realized the power of cinema. But most of all the film gave me hope. It gave me hope like how Andy gave all the inmates hope by building a library, by playing an Italian record, by helping a few prisoners get their high school diploma or even simply by getting all his fellow inmates cold beers after a day of hard work. These acts all gave the prisoners hope as it helped maintain Andy's hope. This movie gave me hope. It helped me get through high school and I have no doubt it will help me get through the rest of my life. The filmmakers do what Andy did for his fellow inmates, they provide the viewer with hope. And in closing I hope that you see this in this clever picture."	10
 good movie	This is an excellent movie, whether it is direction, or cinematography or editing, each and every frame looks brilliant. In fact it is a trendsetting film and I would like to watch it again and again. And last but not the least the background score is also awesome. The background music and the story are weaved together in such a way that it doesn't look that these are two different things. It's like they are made for each other. Each and every character of the movie has given an unforgettable performance and I appreciate each and every technicians' and artistes' hard work which they have put into this movie.	10
 All time best	I think if u see this movie first time, surely you will fall in love with this movie.Excellent work... 👌	10
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen	Tied for the best movie I have ever seencarflo26 November 2003Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.	4
 Goose bumps	You won't regret seeing this movie. Even if you love movies such as Fast and Furious, you will like this one. It's impossible not to like it.	10
 Great film	Referring to Tay Ninh, everyone must immediately think of a sunny and windy midland land with a hot heat, but not so that Tay Ninh does not create for itself its own beauty, from famous places. famous sights such as Ba Den Mountain historical monument nearly 1 km high, where the source of Caodaism - Tay Ninh Holy See, the famous Tay Ninh specialties not only in the country but also spread to the country You like cake soup Trang Bang, and especially the dumplings dried desserts and salt in Tay Ninh.Proud to be one of the children of Trang Bang district, Tay Ninh province, Nhu Binh Salt Cake Factory has been maintaining and promoting the quintessence that the ancients left through the products made from rice paper. drying dew and salt ....	10
 like	Morgan is soo good actor i like him.	10
 The definitive feel good masterpiece	Based on the King short story 'Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption', this Frank Darabont masterpiece has etched itself in the minds of viewers ever since its release as one of the most beloved films of all time. In the beginning of the short story, its alternative title is revealed to us: 'Hope Springs Eternal'. This in essence is the message that the film is trying to convey to the audience, and what a wonderful way it is revealed!	9
 That Good	"None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said ""That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!"" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... ""HOPE"". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just ""comes together"" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"""	9
 One of my favorite movies! Classic	This movie is one of my all time favorites. Undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Story, cast, screenplay all are great. The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. The amazing casting of both Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins is amazing, and couldn't be more accurate. It was narrated by Morgan Freeman, who is the best narrator in Hollywood, I believe. Actually the film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It will change the way u think about things around u. Surely, It will teach you one thing that it is easy to take away a man's bread, even his freedom, but impossible to take away his hope.I can say with confidence this is the best movie I have ever seen - or ever will see. If you haven't watch it yet, just GO! Watch it! Now!	10
 One of the best of the hollywood	When I first read the reviews of this movie I was stunned but later I thought why not to atleast give it a try and I think it was a great decision . I never thought that Andy which felt like a cry baby would do things but he did it .ActingActing is the bestComplete masterpiece reallyFilmographyI think can't describe it in words .ConclusionIt brings tears of happiness and also give all of us a hopeJust don't waste your time reading reviews just see it . It will be one of your best decisions of your life .	10

 Reason Why This is the Best Movie of All Time	"Hope. The central message of ""hope"" in this movie is so strong and universal, it's hard for anyone not to appreciate it. One of those movies that when it's on, you have to finish watching it. If you only watch one movie this lifetime, make it this one. :)"	10
 AMAZING STORY, AMAZING MOVIE TOO	Trust me this one of the movie that u must be watched before dead. I really love the story. Thanks for stephen king!!! Good acting too. Everything about this movie so good. In fact from me thing rating movie should be 9,8 :)	10
 The best!	Everything that a good movie can have is there is this movie.	10
 The best movie of all time	Best movie i have ever seen. This movie is completely different from the rest of the movies i've seen. The actors were outstanding. They gave their 100%. Dramatization was on point. 10/10	10
 A movie worth watching	A movie worth watching, you should not miss, take 2h to see this movie offline, extremely attractive.	9
 One of my all time favorites.	This is one of those movies that I will watch whenever I come across it. Fantastic acting and a surprisingly suspenseful tale. Highly recommend this movie for everyone.	10
 Very Nice	"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen.

 Awesome movie!	Storyline and actors are soo good! All i can say is the whole movie was unexpected!	10
 Greatness	One of the all time great films. Morgan Freeman's acting is superb, Stephen King's work added to the excellent screenwriting and directing has offered a film that would rank top 25 on any list.	10
 really good	I think this movie adds really good emotion it is breath taking and overall very good film.	10
 good	Great!! good movie.......................................	5
 amazing	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 Must watch movie	Finally you would be happy after watching this movie	10
 Completely Misunderstood Storyline	"The plot line here is a complete adaptation of ""The Count of Monty Cristo,"" by Alexander Dumas. You're even told that in the middle of the movie, in case you hadn't noticed the parallels.A man is falsely accused of a crime, and, unable to prove his innocence, is sentenced to life in prison. There, after some time, he makes a friend who teaches him how to stay sane and how to escape. It takes Edmund Dantes 20 years to dig his way out of the Château d'if, but as soon as he escapes, he collects a secret treasure that's been stashed away. He uses the money first to buy revenge, then to buy freedom.Andy Dufresne, similarly imprisoned unfairly, tumbles his way to freedom over 20 years. He ""finds"" the fortune that he helped the warden amass, and gets his revenge on both the prison guard Hadley and warden Norton. He then takes his wealth and buys the freedom and comfort he had dreamed about.For those who might disagree that this is the ""real' story line, why else was the Count of Monte Cristo the only library book book mentioned by name throughout the movie, and the only book out of hundreds when the library donation is first received to be singled out. Andy even says that it's a story about a prison escape.And, as was Edmund Dantes, I wouldn't say that Andy Dufresne found redemption; he found what he was looking for: justice."	10
 Movie of century	Just the masterpiece . The game of actors is so high level. Very sad that now we cant watch something like The Shawhank. Everything in this movie is perfect . Anything remarks . Thanks for this movie Frank Darabont and all actors	10
 A classic	One of the rare occasions where the movie is as good if not better than the book.	
 Must watch	One of my all time favorite....with a spectacular twist that made us so obivous	10
 Should watch it ones in the year	My second loved movie about life friends and how to be stronger	10
 Overrated	This is certainly not a bad film but it is Also completely overated in my opinion. This story has been done a million times and How the wardens didn't notice he was chipping through the wall everyday to escape is beyond me. The acting throughout is very good but i am shocked to see this number 1 on the chart.	6
 Eh...	I have never seen it but Im not sure how good it is.	5
" ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"""	"The movie which gives hope. The movie which is a hope. It's timeless and points out that the time doesn't matter but what we do in that time matters. ""Get busy living or get busy dying."""	10
 Shawshanked	Beautifully narrated ane executed on many levels. Gone, so I thought, were the days when a movie could completely captivate an audience on dialogue alone. Thank you for this masterpiece.	9
 Um dos melhores que já vi na vida	Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.	
 One of the greatest movies of all time	Fascinating story of a banker who was wrongful imprisoned for the murder of his wife and befriends a fellow prisoner. Beautifully directed and masterful acting. I highly recommend Shawshank Redemption.	10
 not good not bad	Time pass movie. not worth the time. production was poor and cast is unprofessional.	9
 World's best movie	Amazing cast,beautifully carried from beginning to end,this is gonna be best after 100 years i bet....	10
 Thought it was ovarrated, turns out it kinda was	"You might be having seconds thoughts about watching it if you are like me(That means you don't like average things that people treat like they are the greatest.)Being the 1st movie on IMDb list is a huge responsibility.I liked this movie, I really did. But I was kinda dissapointed because I was expecting so much more from this film.So I'm going to say that watch this movie without thinking ""This better be the best film ever made."" Because it isn't. But it is an amazing movie that deserves its reputation to a certain degree.Watch this and make people watch it. But don't expect people to treat you like a cinema genius after just watching this movie."	8

 Best Movie Ever	The best movie ever for me.The best movie ever for me.The best movie ever for me.The best movie ever for me.The best movie ever for me.The best movie ever for me.	10
 nothing special	Saw this movie after seeing imdb top rated movies and doubted what s wrong with those people who consider this movie as a masterpiece.the movie is so plain i understand it is a old movie and a feel good one but keeping it number 1 above pulp fiction or prestige movies does nt make any sense	4
 Masterpiece?????? no, a bit overrated	It is a good film as any but I do not see why critics and fans treat is as if it is better than the Godfather 1. I know everybody got their own tastes in films but to me this movie has got a lot of flaws that most fan boys tend to overlook. Some like the movie because it makes them feel good, gives them some kind of hope. The story is okay, the performances are okay even the cinematography but there is nothing special about them	6
 nice la	Good movie i really experienced sad emotions while i was watching it. Jk i laughed at how the Morgan handled things and i strongly do not support that.Casting was done poorly.Overall a bad film that got a lot of attention.If u want to whip and sorrow watch this junk and enjoy it i guess.Nothing more to be added, mediocre attempt at filming.	10
 Good movie	One of the best movies i have seen. It shows us a lot about how we should live our lives and it really made me rethink about everything.Every scene is iconic in this movie and i don't really have anything else to say, because this movie can make you feel different emotions, from tears to very huge smile and satisfaction.	10
 must watch	"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	
 the Best movies of all time ???	I was taken aback ... excellent performances .. very good the Final ... Impeccable performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A Of the best stories taken to the cinema of Stephen King, does not bore you In no second keeps you on all the time. Undoubtedly one of The best movies I saw. It is undoubtedly to be among the Best movies of all time	10
 One of the best screenplays to date!	Hope is all that matters in the worst of the conditions that arise upon us. This is a story about patience and hope. Perfected to one the best screenplays the mainstream movies have ever seen. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman did an excellent job in giving life to the characters. This one stays on the top of my best movie lists.	10
 Very good		10
 The best place ever, Shawshank	"I've never seen a movie like this in my life and I must say that it has been a great opportunity to watch this movie. Having seen this film made me damn realize that there's more into life. I thought life would just be measured inside the four-cornered walls I used to see inside the university and schools I've attended for the past few years of my life. This movie taught me one thing -- ""Keep moving, there's hope."" This movie is a must-see and should be incredibly shown to the world."	10
 What's not to like	Just a all around good movie .. When I get time ill wright more on this review . But for now all you need to know is that it's worth the watch. the first time I watched this movie I just seen the ending and told myself that I have to watch the rest so I know more about it .. To date I have seen this movie more times then I can count .	8
 Classic	One of the best movies ever made. The actors are brilliant , Director und Screenplay A+.The suspense is how should always be in such movies.I personally like the end at most.Morgan Freeman play very good his role and Tim Robbins he should make more acting i almost forgot him as a actor and he is so talented,at age but look at Freeman.I recommend this movie to all.It's one of those movies you shouldn't miss.	10
 Perfect!	For the kids or who will see this film for first time. I would like to recommend you that you select the right movie. It is worth to watch! If you had to paid for watch this movie, pay for it. This movie will brought you to the Andy's Life and his adventure which make you enjoy every second of movie. Dark against Light. Don't hesitate to watch this film, you will never regret.	10
 A Redemption	I came to see The Shawshank Redemption after watching hundreds of films before but it was never too late. Most i can say i was too connected to the bond between two men in redemption that i forgot to notice the notability of the work the motion picture and how its made, didn't check the light or sound engineering or much else. Rare are the films that grasp attention like it does.	9
 This is a famous and popular movie all over the world. It has received many awards.	The story is about a man called Andy. He works at a bank. One day, he gets arrested for murdering his wife and her boyfriend, although he is innocent. He spend time in prison and has so many problems. He meets a man who was given a life sentence, and they develop a great relationship. They never give up trying to get free.I cried when I watched it for the first time because the story was so dramatic. The characters in this story have various backgrounds. Some enjoy their life in prison and the others have no hope and fun. Andy gives me hope. It is so important for us not to give up. YOu should watch it.	9
 Simply amazing. The best film		10
 A great film	I think i have seen this film 100 times. A fantastic movie. The script was well-written. The plot hits all the right marks at the right time. This is a film i would recommend to anyone studying film or script writing. One of the best films ever made in my opinion. The writers ability to write such an engaging story with not many characters is amazing. The film at first didn't get much positive reviews initially but over time people have come to recognize what a wonderful film it is.	10
 Wow	I saw this movie as a child and it changed the way I watched movies. It was the first movie I saw that actually made me love movies, and not just enjoy the story or distraction offered by a film. Just incredible. Watching it again as I get older does nothing to diminish the movie and its story. In fact, it only helps to strengthen my love and respect for this movie, the actors, the director, and every single person who was involved in the creation of this masterpiece.	10
 Not my No1	I love this movie, but for me this is a one time watch movie. It has the element of a surprise, as the important part, so for me one watch is enough. Also, the movie is not timeless, there is nothing more that it will make think about, like the Godfather. The Godfather is definitely a movie No1 on my list at least. It's a classic.	8
" ""Hope is a good thing"" I HOPE you watch this masterpiece"	"Where to begin with the shawshank redemption, well first off it's my all time favourite movie and has been since the first time I saw it. The compelling story of friendship and redemption follows Andy Dufresne being sentenced to two life sentences for a crime he did not commit as he forms a beautiful friendship with Red, played by Morgan Freeman. The acting from the ensemble cast is extraordinary, With career defining performances from Robbins, Freeman, Gunton, brown and Sadler. The story is beautiful and always brings a tear of joy to my eye, mainly due to the incredible music composed by Thomas Newman. If you haven't watched the shawshank redemption, watch it. You will love it and ""that's God's honest truth"" overall a feel good masterpiece that is number 1 on IMDb's 250 greatest movies for good reason. Because it's the greatest film I have ever seen."	10
 Get busy living or get busy dying	I'm sure all people are familiar with a feeling when you want to watch a film, all your friends have told you about, but you don't know if it's any good, and in the middle of watching you are just catching yourself on the thought that you are enjoying this masterpiece. I've got this feeling while watching the Shawshank Redemption. This film is just perfect (for me) in any way. Truly masterpiece. It just makes me happy to know that there are such films in the world. Hope is a good thing, if not the best. This film is a hope. Sure we all know that the there are only a few men so extraordinary as Andy, but it still gives us hope that we can also reach our top. That we could the Andy. 10 out 10	10
 Great all together!	I enjoyed this movie in fact it is on my favorite to watch list and my youtube channel. All of the actors were great and the director really caught me up with all of the action. If you have not yet watched this movie sit down get some popcorn and enjoy. Parents need to know that The Shawshank Redemption is an Oscar-nominated 1994 movie based on a Stephen King story about a man sent to a maximum security prison in Maine in the 1950s who shows the other inmates perseverance and provides a sense of hope and optimism in the bleakest of places and under the most difficult of circumstances. The gritty world of Shawshank Prison is populated with sadistic guards, a corrupt warden, and predatory fellow inmates. Prison rape, while not graphically shown, is very strongly implied, with references and body positions suggesting forced anal and oral sex.	6
 One of the greatest movies ever made!	In this movie Morgan Freeman has delivered his greatest performance in his legendary career. Awesome right? but that's not all.Shawshank Redemption is without doubt the best movie of its decade and one of the best movies ever made. Killer plot, great directing, great cinematography, amazing acting and in the end you are left stunned, touched and you will fall in love with it. If you do not like this movie something is definitely wrong with you.This movie not winning any Oscar is simply disgraceful.In conclusion if you haven't watched this movie than you are missing a lot.	10
 The Best Movie of All Time.	"Once again, another year (or Christmas) goes by and this movie is thrust onto the television screen for all to enjoy. And what an enjoyable movie it is - as I've seen it countless times now.The major theme that runs throughout this film is hope. The main character Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, is the one who shines a beacon of hope like an Olympic athlete carrying the torch to the cauldron, and this starts from time he enters Shawshank prison. The other main character, Red, played by Morgan Freeman, said he took to liking him from the beginning as ""he strolled, like a man in a park without a care or a worry in the world, like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say...I liked Andy from the start."" And Andy even inspires Red to ""hope"" for a life outside of the prison walls and to join him in a free life on a Mexican beach by the Pacific sea.And the theme of hope is also enforced by a darker side. The prison librarian, Brooks, played by James Whitmore, who has been a resident for 50 years, is given parole and leaves prison to ""enter"" life outside of the four walls. And upon realising that he can't come to terms with the pace of life and no family or friends to turn to, he loses hope, and ends his life. I think that this theme is the magic that most people like about this movie. It's the glue that joins the friendship between Andy and Red. And its the thing that viewers, like me, can relate our life and experiences to.Even after so many viewings I still feel that this movie is powerful and a revelation to pretty much every person. Its pretty much a powerful contemporary tale of a Biblical story. A story about hope, friendship, loss, betrayal, contempt (particularly what the antagonist prison warden Norton brings), brutality, injustice, crime and so forth.I think that this movie deserves to be played on a yearly basis, particularly on Christmas day. It's a modern day retelling of a Biblical story. I believe everyone should see this movie at least once."	10
 The Shawshank Redemption is excellent!	The Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film following the story of a man who was wrongly accused of murdering his wife and sentence to life in prison. I highly suggest this movie to anyone, from a general audience to filmmakers. If it weren't for Red, played by Morgan Freeman, I don't believe the protagonist, Andy would have made it through these brutal times. In the ending, after being neglected a trial when it was proved he wasn't the murderer, he escapes by digging his way out of Shawshank prison. This film is very suspenseful and inspirational! A must see for all.	10
 One of the most iconic movies you will ever see!!!	This movie is by far my personal favorite film of ALL TIME!!! It is a classic and will always hold up over the generations. Adapted from a novel by Stephen King, this film tells a story through amazing direction, acting and writing. The Shawshank Redemption will suck you in and feed on almost every emotion you have, then spit you out wanting more. The next best movie to this would probably be The Green Mile (also adapted from a Stephen King novel). I should probably write a longer and more eloquent review, but you will just have to trust me and watch this one. I NEVER watch a film more than once, maybe twice. I have seen this one over 20 TIMES!!! Do yourself a favor and get hooked on it like I did! You won't regret it ;-)-J-	10
 One of the all time bests!	This has to be one of the all time greats of the movies. The amazing story-line and the brilliant acts by Time Robbins and Morgan Freeman left me speechless and emotional in the end. Morgan Freeman's narrations at regular intervals are always triggering something inexpressible...The story teaches us many things like the difficulty of prison life, the desperation of those prisoners for their freedom and the abundance of 'TIME' they have in contrast to the out-side-world, etc.From the beginning to the very end, this sensitive movie does attach the viewers to it and, I must say, such movies are very rare in numbers, specially nowadays.	10
 The best ever	It's and will always be my Favorite movie ever. It just can take you to the forever thinking in hope. Just finished watching for the 19th time and still interested about every little detail about the characters, story and everything. It's the kind of movies that really touches you that can make a difference in your way of thinking. all I can tell is that if you are thinking about watching this movie, you have to prepare your snack, buy an HD version, close all the lights and really enjoy. it just makes you curious about freedom for example. some scenes have to be replayed times and times again. I really enjoyed watching the great Morgan Freeman best performance ever. It's really recommended if you are feeling depressed or down. also on of the most thing it's gonna affect you about is the Friendship, Really glad to watch such a great movie.	10
 Perfect Movie	"If you wonder if there is a perfect movie, then don't, cause this is the ultimate movie that we as humans can do .And yes there is a few other movies that are perfect . I don't think if there is anyone hate this movie, simply because it hits on a multiple nerves 😊 .Spoilers .. spoilers.. spoilers..""There are places in this world that aren't made out of stone. That there's something inside... that they can't get to, that they can't touch. That's yours. HOPE .""""Remember Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies""""Get busy living or get busy dying.""Finally, it's not only about Hope, that's just one thing ."	10
 it is the best		10
" An easy ""10""..."		10
 Not as much as i expected.	When i didn't saw this movie, i thought it'd be cool as IMDb top rated movie. But i don't think to be this movie IMDb top rated. It's nothing but different than a prison break story. Actually, there's some inspirational quotes in this. movie what led it to be top. But i didn't find it much cool.But i loved some of it's part. The corruption of the govt. people make me amazed.The acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were appreciated. I only got a message from the movie is there's still hope until my death. As much hard as you can, you'll be able to grab your success. It happens in our real life. It was a good thing that patients can give you every thing you want in your life. You just need to get stuck with it until you get it.	10
 Not Bad, Just Overrated		6
 Amazing	"Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption. The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing.No action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other.The Shawshank Redemption and To Kill a Mockingbird are the best movies I have ever seen. I do not judge it by it's technical merits - I don't really care about that. I have read that Citizen Kane or The Godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. They may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like The Shawshank Redemption to touch the soul."	10
 Probably Not #1	Whilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average. Boring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.	8
 Superb	This movie was amazing story, it takes us look at the other side of prisoners in prisons and how they feel when they return to society. Many people are ignore how they feel when back to society. There are so many thing we can learn in this movie. For the fans of Morgan Freeman, he did a ggrat job in this movie and other actor is very good also. Moreover,the film tells us that the truth will always win, although it requires a long time. Many things are not unexpected from this film. So for those who are bored with films that have a simple story, this might be a recommendation for you. You must focus to the movie when you watching it to get the meaning of the story. The story is very slick and classy.	10
 I don't understand the high rating	I cannot understand why this movie is so highly rated. The Green Mile was better than this movie, by leaps and bounds. This movie was mildly pleasant at best. It has a typical happy ending. It has the kind of wrap up reminiscent of a romantic comedy. It doesn't seem very authentic, men in prison are miserable or unrelatable. The main characters truly come off as insane. No movie starring Morgan Freeman was every truly a great piece. He tries too hard to be profound, and it makes him look like a dumb smug ass. I don't have anything against him though. But he'll never be Denzel Washington. He's like bad luck. Maybe it's based on a book that was much better, haha!

 awesome..........................	"what an awesome movie it is? Worth watching it. All time favorites... Whenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as ""The Movie"". When I say ""The Movie"", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title. Because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison."	10
 The movie is good	It's a rhythm that is well thought out. When we look at the same actors, it is easy to forget the time span of the film for more than 20 years. Such a great measure in reality, time will be too slow, will only be amplified in prison. It's not like the movie is not interested in these moments. Still know, this is just a plan in the sweet time to get there. In return, the monotonous life of prison makes it more exciting. It seems that this is a moment that will never be forgotten.

 One of the Most Inspiring & Motivational Movie!	This is one of the Best movie i have seen in my life till date! It actually shows you how to live a goddamn life. There are many messages lying in this film and the best 2 are known to you all. It actually showed me that life is not what we think it is! Its about going down Hundred times and getting back Thousand times! Life is always should be considered as Fighting with the Storm(sometimes it may be Tornado!). But once the storm is over, you won't remember how you made it through, or how you managed to survive. You won't even be sure, whether the storm is really over or not. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in! That's what this storm's all about! It makes you totally a different person! So always Keep your Hope constant and Get Busy Living the Goddamn Life on your own! :)	10
 Perfect.		9
 Loved the plot and conflicts in this movie	Loved the movie, watched it several times now and always see something new. Great human conflicts. Clever plot. Acting was superior. Catch myself thinking what it must be like to be in a prison every time I watch it. Could not do it. The movie draws you in and you can't help feeling like you a part of it. The interaction of the characters had so many levels of emotions tied to them. Can't imagine what people must feel when they are innocent and end up in prison Horrifying thought on so many levels. The ending was great, but I wanted to see more. wanted to know what their future was like. wanted to see it. I love the fact that the movie actually brought you to the reunion of the two main characters and how it played out.	9
 Best movie ever made .. redemptive	"i was visiting my college friend in his hometown,, during our college time we use to bunk classes to watch movies,, first ever Hollywood movie that mesmerized our mind was ""Fight Club"", we had never experience anything like that movie before. so we were talking over coffee discussing movies one evening, so he asked me do you know number one movie on IMDB250 chart list & i replied Godfather of course, he replied no dude you are wrong ,, something new replaced it ,, it called Shawsank Redemption ,, i was like,, what???? never heard of it? he told me he bought a DVD of the movie & ask me to watch it.. first of all i should tell everyone that i am big Morgan freeman fan..but i have never seen Tim Robbins in any role before, As the movie flow with the essence of acting & direction ,, i was falling in love with every scene. after the completion of the movie i can surely say this was the best motion picture ever. i would suggest watch it once & you will fall in love with it to watch to again"	10
 Best movie of all time	"When this movie was released it was a ""flop"" in the cinemas. That doesn't stop it from being the best movie of all time. In the start it is just getting into the story. It is dramatic. Then the story gets into the prison, where Andy finds it hard to fit in. He then befriends Red, Morgan Freeman. As they bond Andy imports various tools to help him to, spoilers, escape from prison. If we go back a bit we get to the saddest bit in the movie. When, spoilers, Brooks dies. He had a bird called Jake at the prison that he let free. When he got his parole, he went to work for a grocery store. The problem was, he had been in prison for too long. He didn't remember how to live in a world outside the prison. One day, he couldn't take it anymore. he carved into the wall ""Brooks was here"" and hung himself at the spot.After Andy escaped from the prison, he let Red know where he was headed. When Red got his parole, he went to follow where Andy was. It was a long journey, but he made it. It ended at a scene where Andy was working on a boat and Red walking up to him.To sum up, this deserves to be the most liked movie all time. It wouldn't be up there in the best movie of all time with movies such as The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Apocalypse Now. Apart from that, it is my favourite movie of all time, over all of those movies."	10
 Opinion	"Astonishing. Simply perfect. This is by far my favorite movie and I'm sure that every single guy/girl out there who ever watched it or will ever watch it will ""fall for it"" just the way I did. I never really liked long movies, but this one made me resist 'till the end and believe me, people, it was not just me. All of my friends and all the people I know that saw this told me the exact same thing. So just stop searching. Andy's struggle is a lesson. A very important lesson to anyone. Anyone can find something to learn in it. So just watch it, please, and rate 10 stars and then share your opinions so that more and more people would watch it and share and so on."	10
 Amazing example of Story Arc	An amazing piece of film. Penned by Stephen King and directed by Frank Darabont, this one sneaks up on you, takes you to the lowest place of the human spirit then takes you in the exact opposite direction. Totally snubbed by the Oscars, but one of the greatest films of all time. Told in the narrative style, conducted by Morgan Freeman, we get a picture of the prison system of the 1940s-1960s and some of the wildly unique characters who inhabit the walls of Shawshank Prison. Shawshank, is a frequent and oft referenced institution of many of Stephen King's stories (both written and on screen) and every time i hear the name in any of his works it makes me think of this story.	10
 A classic	In 1947 Andy Dufresne is jailed for life for the murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison where he tells his fellow inmates he is innocent but as fellow inmate 'Red' says; everybody in Shawshank is innocent. Red has already served ten years and is the guy to see if you want something smuggled into the prison. Andy asks for two things; a small rock hammer and Rita Hayworth! Soon after Red provides him with one rock hammer and a large poster featuring Rita Hayworth. Life in Shawshank is not easy; the guards are brutal and some of the inmates are worse. Andy survives though and things get better when he is able to help the meanest of the guards avoid paying tax on an inheritance; soon he is acting as accountant to the whole prison and helping the corrupt warden squirrel away large sums of money earned by prison labour. He is able to use this position to improve the life of prisoners too; a few beers for a work party, improvements to the prison library and education for some inmates. All the time Andy professes his innocence then one day after he has spent almost twenty years behind bars a young man comes to Shawshank; the man tells the story of how a cellmate at a previous prison claimed to have murdered a man and the woman he was with leaving her banker husband to take the blame. Andy believes this may finally get him out of prison but there is no way the warden will let him go; he is too useful and he knows too much that won't stop Andy though.This film, based on a Stephen King short story, is rightfully considered a classic. There are no scenes that felt unnecessary from start to finish the story moves at a good pace. We see both the good and the bad inside the prison; there are scenes of brutality but also scenes of joy such as watching the prisoners enjoy the simple pleasure of having a cold beer of a scorching day it is details like this that make the film special. There is also the joy of seeing that Andy will not break and his greatest triumph coming just as it looks as if he has finally reached breaking point. The cast does a great job; Tim Robbins is great as Andy and the always reliable Morgan Freeman is on top form as Red; theirs is one of the great portrayals of a screen friendship. It isn't just the likable characters who are well acted though; Bob Gunton is subtly unpleasant as the hypocritical Warden; quoting scripture one minute profiteering, and much worse, the next; Clancy Brown is also great as the truly unpleasant Captain Hadley; the senior guard who brutalises the inmates. After the suffering inside the finale chapter where we see Andy's escape and revenge makes this a feel-good movie despite what we've seen before. This is definitely a must see film.	10
 Yes it is a great film, but does it deserve to be number one?	I watched this film several times and I am fascinated with it today as I was then when I watched it. Everything is top of the line. Acting, plot, camera, everything.Plot involving jail in 1940s is really an interesting plot and characters are really colorful. I think that was one of the films when Morgan Freeman came to fame. Other actors are fantastic too. This story is timeless and it will probably be watched many times over and over again by many people in the future.However, I am not sure that it deserves to be number one on IMDb top 250 films of all times. I would put Schindler*s list there rather then this film. But that is just me.	8
 Grate Movie		10
 Good Movie	"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"	10
 A movie that touches the heart...	This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting of the main protagonists - Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman - are brilliant. The movie is about hope and redemption. It is also about how uncertain life is - how circumstances can lead a person to disastrous consequences through no fault of his own.Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy Dufresne - a banker who is sent to jail for murdering his wife - was as natural as ever. Morgan Freeman as a seasoned convict Red who goes through a transformation during his time with Andy makes you feel for the man. Bob Gunton will make you hate the evil hypocritical warden with all your heart. Overall, everyone has done a beautiful job with their roles.This film touched a special chord in my heart. I never tire of watching it. If you love the drama genre, this movie is for you.	10
 A Cage Bird	It is so funny how the justice system is back then and even now. They try to impose the max sentenced allowed without the fact or on some false or beefed up charges. But the final say is never theirs because you can never keep a bird that is meant to fly free caged for very long. I like that fact that Andy never let the best get the best of him. H.O.P.E. (H)aving (O)nly (P)ositive (E)xpectation.. never losing site that anything and everything is possible even in the hands of the law. Hoep changes everything. In the Andy got the last laugh, all the way to the bank then to an island looking at the beautiful blue ocean and repairing his boat. Like I said, you can never keep a bird caged for very long.	10
 A Must See Film	"I remember watching this for the first time in my Highschool Film as Literature class in the year 2010. At that moment, it became one of my all-time favorite movies, nearing the top. I had no clue who Frank Darabont was, but it's amazing how much you can respect someone without even meeting the individual. The direction, the acting, the set, EVERYTHING was impeccable! The symbolism in just the smallest things pushed the story even further. I'd encourage everyone to read biographies about this film to know and understand the true intensity of Mr. Darabont's ""Shawshank Redemption"". It's not a surprise to me that many have given this a 10 out of 10 rating as I have. If you haven't seen it, go see it. Then read the biographies."	10

 well this has to be one of the best		10
 about best movie	in my opinion this movie will never be old fashion always has something new for people.great performances of actors and wonderful story make this movie one of my best.I am not able to forget i can't compare this movie with another movies never and never Ne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.	10
 Best of all time?	So is this the best of all time? For me personally no, but its def in the top 20, and I think this is probably true for most people. It is the most consistent highly rated movie, that's why it is the best. The friendship between the two main chars is the star of the movie. You will probably like this movie regardless of what age you are or your typical movie preference. Pretty awesome writing. This also shows that you don't need to spend 200m to make a good quality film, just get a good story, good actors and good screen writing. There is a huge trend in Hollywood now that you gotta spend huge to get a good return, they can learn a lot from The ShawShank Redemption	10
 A Different Kind of Stephen King Story.	This is an outstanding movie from beginning to end. The cast was picked with excellence and the characters were made so that the audience would care about them. Even though the middle of the story was a bit slow, it began to drag when it started building up the plot for the climax in the middle. Stephen King does not usually write novels as a drama and when he does do it, it is critically acclaimed. It is amazing how much though was put into making this story, with the back tracking to reveal major plot points and how this happened. Morgan Freeman's narration is excellent in this movie too, his character is one you won't forget because of how strong his performance is. Over all this is a fantastic movie. If you haven't see this yet I recommend you do, this movie is one you won't want to forget.	10
 A masterpiece which deserves to be seen by all the world.	Well, for at the start of the movie we have a story that catch our attention. Since the first minutes are arising in our heads series of questions that have no answers until it reaches the unexpected ending and even then you're left with some doubt and you must let your imagination fly. Was or was not he? Highly recommended at any time, is not heavy in any occasion and for all the publics, it could seem too large for some people but as i said is not heavy at all anytime. I give a 10/10 because of the amazing interpretation and the history.Ernest	10
 Best film ever made(for me)		10
 Great Movie	And one of the saddest in the world! Andy really had a hard time of it. This is one of those films where I always wonder if I got stuck in jail what would my life be like? What exactly would I do? How would I live and how exactly would I survive. The only current TV show that brings back those emotions is Orange is the New Black. Feeling isolated and stuck.The breath of this film can be summed up in a few ways but most of the human spirit and the will to survive against all odds. Hope is the answer and name of the game in this film. Trying to control your surroundings even though control is the least you have.	10
 Earned every bit of its rating!	Easily one of the best titles out there. It is a great mixture of comedy, drama, suspense, mystery, and basically any genre that you can mold into this! If you haven't seen it or wish to see it, then I would not wait any longer. This is a must-see of all movies. Morgan Freeman imposes a classic character that is recognizable in his other roles, but clearly deserves the most praise due to the immense hype over this film. Lost best picture only because of the other great movies in its year, but would have been a killer any other time. Saw a behind the scenes about it and director did not even think it would be this well received.	10
 Hope and Friendship	One of the last places you would expect to see a movie about hope and the deep bonds of friendship takes place in a prison. This drama is a worthy top 100 film, and I believe that is where it will stay for many years to come. There is a fair amount of explicit language throughout the movie, so for those that cannot tolerate language, this may ruin the redeeming qualities of the movie for you.One quality I look for in a good movie is to get lost in the film, to the point that I begin to feel the emotions of characters. Here you will find a bit of everything, hopelessness, hope, love, and anger. Put it this way, if I had only three movies to pick to watch the rest of my life, this would be one. If there was a reading rainbow list for movies, then I would highly suggest you pick up a copy and watch this movie. Hope you enjoy	10
 Excellent Movie	"The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 USA drama film, written and directed by Frank Darabont and starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman (both are great actors for me). It is ranked #1 in IMDb's ""Top 250"" list and is considered one of the best movies of all time.For me It's a great movie, I really don't understand how this movie couldn't have win an Oscar, although we all know that it is more fake. Recommended for everyone to see it, has a little of everything, you can also realize sometimes justice is not done correctly.Many people'll claim that The Shawshank Redemption is the best film ever made, and it is difficult to argue against it, however, everyone should watch this film at least once or two in their lives."	10
 under appreciated @ box-office but worthy IMDb rating	for those who like to watch prison life style and how every friend counts in that situation. A wholesome package of Entertainment. yes the time line of this movies seems to move forward slowly many times but every time a heart touching conversation makes it worthy again. At least one time must see the movie of course if you have time and you like this kind of movies . this movie is about how a person can get in prison because of a silly decision and how rough prison life can be. obviously in that case making friend is not an easy task , but making enemy is a pretty easy one but the result of that is not a pretty one.then again this movie is about how a man lives in this kind of a situation and how he makes friends , how he takes care of his conscious and above all how he survives this .....	10
 A Classic Movie	This Movie is one of the best Movies i watched.Tim Robins leads a Great Character as Andy Dufrense.He is Amazing Through out all the Movie.Although his friend Ellis Boyd(Morgan Freeman) have best lead character.He helps him to escape from the Prison. The movie is about how a Innocent Man got to Prison.When He realize that he is innocent he planing to escape from that prison.There is no action, no special effects - just men in prison uniforms talking to each other. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him	10
 This is the one of the timeless classics	I love this movie. It truly is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. A timeless classic. It gets the full 10 from me. It sends us numerous messages and has hidden meanings. Its so beautifully laid out and filmed. It teaches us a lot about ex convicts also. Yes, they may have did wrong to go to prison but some can't handle the outside world the way they used to. It has all the emotions embedded in it. Funny, sad, happy, deep all of those emotions and more. I would definitely recommend this movie to everybody I meet. Its beautifully shot to capture the essences of every character and their feelings and emotions. The writing is spectacular. As a writer myself I like to look at the writing and acting. I'm also an actress so those are the two qualities I focus on. The story line is extremely important. If it doesn't make sense then it ruins the movie completely. The acting in this was sensational. The storyline was genius. Definitely worth the full 10 out of 10 rating that I am giving it.	10
 Greatest movie All-time	Anyone that has ever experienced hardship through no fault of their own will agree. First movie I have ever seen that draws tears with a happy ending. VERY INSPIRING. I even named my son Andy because of this movie....GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING...that's god damn right! Anyone can get caught in their own personal Shawshank..This movie is a great guide on how to deal with bad luck. Weather the storm and never lose hope!! The ending with Red is great! It is impossible to say what my favorite tune is...Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time. The brainless trolls can watch the big budget films all the want.. If you are a Shawshank fan, another great movie to watch is The Way, Way Back.	10
 superb crime movie	"Darabont constructs the film to observe the story, not to punch it up or upstage it. Upstaging, in fact, is unknown in this film; the actors are content to stay within their roles, the story moves in an orderly way, and the film itself reflects the slow passage of the decades. ""When they put you in that cell,"" Red says, ""when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. Old life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" Watching the film again, I admired it even more than the first time I saw it. Affection for good films often grows with familiarity, as it does with music. Some have said life is a prison, we are Red, Andy is our redeemer. All good art is about something deeper than it admits."	10
 Awesomeeeee	Awesome movie. Loved loved loved it. I love everybody in the movie. This is my all time favorite movie. I loved morgan freeman in it. It really showed how life can be when u get locked up. Then it also shows what happens to the men who have been locked up for a long time. They don't know anything or anybody else besides the people and guards they was locked up with. I liked how they put a different spin and view on it.They let people see how things use to go on in the jail from a very very very long time ago and how men didn't want to leave because jail was all they knew. they didn't know much about the outside because it had changed so much. If i was them i don't think i would want to leave either. i loved the movie. i bought it and i watch it everyday.	10
 Proof Hollywood can still manufacture timeless entertainment	"Pain, death, love and hate have never been personified the beautifully on screen. Storyline, story-arc and character-arc are alive and well in the creative light of this picture. A welcomed reminder of good triumphing over not just evil, but the time good needs to find it's foundation, grow, live and learn under evils presences to survive. Quoting fellow IMDb member Tim Cox ""One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate.

 Frank Darabont's masterpiece		10
 I can certainly see why this is number 1.	"This movie is a masterpiece. You may have seen some good movies but few can compare to this one. This is the plot. In 1947 a wrongly accused banker named Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is sent to Shawshank Prison for murdering his wife. He meets the corrupt Warden, Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) and the brutal corrections officer, Captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown). He also meets the prison fixer Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) who was also incarcerated for murder. Andy and Red soon become good friends. Then one day while tarring the license plate factory roof, Andy helps Captain Hadley organize his money in a way that the government will be unable to take any taxes. Hadley tells the other officers about it, including Warden Norton and Andy is soon doing tax returns for all the guards in Shawshank. Life is becoming better for Andy and his fellow inmates, when he pushes for more books for the prison library. Meanwhile the old prison librarian Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore) is paroled from Shawshank. But Brooks can not adapt to life on the outside and hangs himself. Then things get worse when Norton tries to get more money from illegal activities using Andy. In 1963 a new prisoner named Tommy Williams (Gil Bellows) arrives at Shawshank and reveals that he knows the man that killed Andy's wife. Andy tries to bring this up to Norton, but Norton puts Andy in solitary and has Hadley kill Tommy to keep him quiet. Now Andy has just about had enough. In 1947 Red got Andy a rock hammer, which he used to dig a tunnel under his Rita Hayworth poster. When he was released from solitary years later he uses it and escapes Shawshank. He turns Norton and Hadley to the police, who arrest Hadley. Norton on the other hand kills himself. In 1967 Red is paroled. He fears he will end up like Brooks but he made a promise to Andy to help him set up a hotel in Mexico so Red travels there where the two friends are united. This film is great for a number of reasons. The friendship aspect between Andy and Red which grows over a long period of time. It also addresses the issue of rehabilitation and if prisoners who have been in there a large portion of their lives can ever be rehabilitated or if they just become adapted to prison life so much that they falter if sent to the outside world. Overall it's just a great movie so I hugely recommend it."	10
 Simply Amazing	This movie is simply amazing, no doubt about it. I found it moving yet funny in parts and it brought a tear to my eye. I would really recommend this movie to anyone because each person I have recommended it to has enjoyed it immensely and begs to watch it again. The ending is one that is very shocking but it all makes sense, making you want to watch it again to see how the ending could end in this way. Red was a favourite character of mine, not just because he was played brilliantly by Morgan Freeman, but also because this character brought humor to the story with a slight sad twist towards the end. I loved this movie and it will remain one of my favourites for a long time.	10
 Excellent movie! One of the best that Hollywood has to offer!		10
 My verdict	One of the best films I've ever seen. Great inspiration from everyone. Shows life how it was . Even when life's that bad you don't have to have it that way. Great star Morgan Freeman . Plays a character RED which is heart warming. There are some sad times of the feature but it wouldn't be a box smash without all kinds of genre included. Such a great script and great camera work. I love the fact Andy is a nobody then becomes the highlight of the prison for putting his foot down and stepping up to the mark that everyone else was to scared to cross. Great plot. I have seen this over double figures and still see new bits as its a lengthy film	10
 In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder,		10
 By far a master piece	One of, if not, the best movies I have ever come across. A very heart warming and inspirational film that never ceases to put a smile on my face no matter how many times I see it. Fill with memorable scenes and dialog. Acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman alone make this movie a great gem. The story is focused in a prison, but the focus of the film is hope, patience, redemption ( as in the title), and friendship. The movie contains a lot of symbolism, but it identifies itself quite clearly. I urge you if you call yourself a film fanatic to go watch this movie if you have never seen it. It has some the best characters to it.	10

" ""I feel like I have touched the God infinitely."""		10
 Masterpiece	This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story is not that original, I've seen other movies with a similar story. It's the way the movie is portrayed that makes this movie a masterpiece. The cast is great and you really feel with Andy the whole time.In the beginning Andy really had bad luck. To have your wife being killed at the moment you found out she had an affair. It's was also really unfortunate that he was near the crime scene with a gun. He seemed guilty. His first years in the prison were also very hard for Andy. At the moment he's doing better, I felt better. Then the story continues to have an unexpected turn. The better Andy's life was going, the better I was feeling. I was very glad to see there was justice in the end.After you finish watching this movie, you feel really good. You feel like you've went through an incredible journey and it all ended well. I would recommend anyone I know to watch this movie as soon as possible.	10
 Best Movie	What a beautiful movie. I can watch this movie over and over. There is not one thing wrong with this picture. The beautiful settings. The talented cast. And I have to say Stephen King's greatest screenplay. Tim Robbins plays the role of a life time. I love how he plays an innocent criminal as he quietly escapes from a prison and returns to a normal life. Morgan Freeman was powerful. His wonderful sounding voice eases the audience through out the movie. A story of a friendship between 2 convicted murderers over 30 years. I also love how elements of horror were added to this movie to have a true feel to a Stephen King movie. The part where the guy gets dragged back into the cell is more haunting then any horror version of that same shot. This is a must watch for everyone. No matter where you catch this movie. Beginning, middle, or, end, it is worth watching. <3	10
 Deserving of the #1 spot on the top 250.		10
 A must-see movie		10
 One of the best I've seen so far	I have just finished watching this movie. It is amazingI really did not think it was going to be this good. After hearing so many great reviews from friends and relatives alike, I've finally decided to watch it. I love it.The story is amazing the main character Andrew is a pure genius. He manages to build a library in the prison, do taxes for prisoners, guards, and warden alike, comes with perfect escape plan, and exploits Warden's corruption, fakes his identity, and finally gives a gift to his friend Red.I thought the performance were amazing too. Morgan Freeman is just amazing at every act he does. Other actors were pretty damn good as wellwell-deserving 10 out of 10	10
 A powerful, wrenching experience	This film, if it isn't one of the greatest of all time, at least I can say it is one of the greatest I've ever seen. This is a must-recommend, because to be honest, this is one of the many movies a movie lover must see before they die. It is not just a great film, but a great experience. And it is quite the experience! Morgan Freeman gives the performance of his career in this film. I give props to the director for making him narrate the film as well. He is just that great. Tim Robbins give a very underrated performance in this film. Freeman stole the show, but there was a certain subtlety of Robbins' that can't go without being recognized. Either way, both these men give their full effort into this film. There is a great atmosphere around this film as well, it's a subtle tone, as this is a subtle, (But great) film, but it changes when it needs to change, and it knows exactly when. As a matter-of-fact, what makes this movie great is that it knows exactly when it needs to do something powerful, thoughtful or sentimental, and to be honest as a moviegoer, that is all I can ask for.	10
 Sleeper King		8
 One of the greatest film achievements.	"I was born in the 90's so I did not grow up watching The Shawshank Redemption. 2 years ago or so I decided to watch it. I was blown away. It moved me in a way that few other movies have. It is a masterpiece. Imagine if your life was taken away from you and all you had was your thoughts about what you did, what you have done, or what you were going to do. Wouldn't it drive you nuts, wouldn't it make you want to give up hope in life. That is the key word in this film, ""hope"". When Andy suffers during that whole time he is at Shawshank prison, you feel for him yet you keep thinking that it will end bad for him and his friend Red. As their relationship grows, Andy's plan to escape grows and soon he fines hope that he will escape that God awful place, and then he does and you cant help but to ball your eyes out after realizing what this man had to do to reach his goal. And then the last scene with Andy and Red symbolizes that this film is for the weak who strive to be strong. The writing, acting, directing, cinematography all make this one of the greatest films of all time."	10
 A seriously good movie...!		9
 Two decades in a masterpiece !!!		10
 To make it short	"There is nothing to criticize about this movie. It is made as subtle and touching a movie can be. It never goes into emotions more than necessary. The music, the story, the acting, everything is perfectly orchestrated. It is delicate and beautiful in all the sense of the term. It is such a shame that Morgan Freeman didn't got an award, it would have been well deserved. Stephen King wrote again a masterpiece, like the Green Mile, from the same author and the same film director. Frank Darabont execute this story more in a tone that reminds me ""Out of Africa"". The prison is a character by itself, all the actors including the secondary roles are just perfect. Watching this movie remains us the true meaning of hope, and that everything is possible. But what are you doing here? Rather than reading reviews, just buy it, rent it and see it. It is one kind of a unique movie that you will never forget."	10
 A banker convicted for the murder of his Wife and her Lover experiences a brutal and corrupt prison and attempts to change this.	A wonderful film, truly one of the best ever made and deserving of its place among the top films. There may be problems but the clever story line and brilliant actors will distract you from that. Tim Robbins has a good role as Andy Dufresne, the banker convicted for the murder of his wife and her Lover. Morgan Freeman has an absolutely brilliant role with his portrayal of Red, the experienced prison Fixer, in an example of excellent casting. The film shows the corruption within the prison system and has excellent characterisation. The idea of leaving prison is questioned throughout the film, as the characters wonder how beneficial leaving prison will really be. The film is certainly quite violent but the storyline more then makes up for this. The ending is delightful to watch but I won't spoil it. You should watch the film yourself.	10
 Amongst the greatest films ever made....PERIOD	I have often wondered, before seeing this film,how on Earth in became the No.1 rated film on IMDb. I felt it was certainly overrated as there were some masterpiece films that I believed deserved a higher rating, such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Original Star Wars trilogy, Godfather Parts I and II as well as other classics like the first Matrix.However, I finally watched the film and I was completely stunned. I just never expected the film to contain so much emotion and so little of worthless action. This film is one of the best films ever made and I believe it certainly does deserve a No.1 ranking on IMDb.The acting in this film is just superb, especially by Morgan Freeman. I mean, this legend, is in some of the best films ever made like Shawshank Redemption, Se7en and the Dark Knight. Morgan Freeman is simply unbelievable in this film and the relationship between his character, Red and Andy was just superbly filmed. It actually gave me tears****SPOILERS****When Brooks was finally released from Shawshank, he realises the outside world is too much for him and commits suicide. This scene was just so sad it left me crying. The same when Red was released, I again started crying. The scene were Norton kills himself was totally surprising and a shock to me, realizing that Andy had truly defeated him and there was nothing for him to live for.The ending scene where Red and Andy reunite after all those days, or years, was just breathtaking and I was glad the film ended the way it did. I've heard people complaining about the ending, saying that it was too long and extended, but I strongly believe this ending worked perfectly well.****END OF SPOILERS****Overall, if anyone hasn't seen this film I'll tell you know....GO WATCH THE FILM....You won't regret it.	10
 Everyone say it's the best film but it really is one of the best film!	Everyone says the shawshank redemption is one of the best films made but i can't disagree. Everything about it makes it the film it is the sound , setting and the narrating by Morgan freeman. The film is a crime drama and we understand at the start of the film that Andy dufrense is a intelligent man and seems very quite at the beginning of the film, he seems a though he thinks a lot.We then get to understand Andy better when he becomes close friends with red who is has been at shawshank for many years. we are then shown as a spectator Andy experience in shawshank from fighting of the rapists which then ends up with the main one getting transferred to then helping out Hadley with his financial issues to then becoming a friend of warden Norton. however this all changes when Andy finds out the warden can help him to get out of shawshank because he can prove he is innocent but the warden refuses to do this which turns out to be a big mistake for him as we come to see one of the best scenes of movie when we find out Andy had escaped from shawshank but not only doing that giving the FBI all the corrupt documents that Norton was involved in which then leads to the FBI coming to arrest Norton.we then see red walking along the beach and smiles at Andy as he is walking up to him.It's not just the story than makes this a great film. the sound which was used in the film made it even better the music used was just right for each scene and was one of the best parts about the film also. if you haven't watch the shawshank redemption yet i would recommend it.	10
 My No.1 Film of all time	Yes it might contain some clichés and be somewhat predictable but this film is an absolute masterpiece and it is a clear leader at the top of my list of best films of all time. It is only a travesty that it didn't win the Oscars it deserved because of the hype surrounding Forrest Gump that year (not knocking FG because it is a great film also). This is the only film ever that everyone I meet agrees is a brilliant movie. If you are just coming out of the jungle or have been locked in a basement at the hands of a crazed lunatic for years and you somehow are one of the few people on the planet who hasn't seen this movie then you have to change that right now ! Watch it and Love it.	10
 Highly Enjoyable - Very Accurate To The Facts	This film is one of the few remaining masterpieces that hasn't needed, nor will need to suffer the indignity of a poor remake.All throughout the film you feel truly connected to Andy & Red. From the trial in court, getting off the bus, through to Red finally getting his parole at the end.The genius of the tunnelling through the walls, covering them with a poster, to the ingenuity of swapping the books and shoes over with the incompetent warden.Very well directed, amazing actor's at their best.Highly recommend for anyone wanting a good film.	10
 Good but not as good as IMDb users make it out to be		8
 A 142 minute sermon on hope.		9
 One of the BEST films ever made!!		10
 No surprise why it's the highest rated film on IMDb		10
 Absolutely amazing! You will laugh and cry	I only need to write a few words. This film made me laugh, cry, cheer and feel warm inside. Not a lot of films are capable of doing that. The acting is brilliant and so believable. It's quite a long film, but rightfully so. You are actually left feeling like you want more. Even writing these words down makes me want to get it out and watch it again. It is always a good time to watch this film. You will not regret it.I'm actually surprised it hasn't got a full 10 stars.To the director i would say, Thank you for making this film!If you haven't seen it, watch it, right now. It doesn't matter what time it is...go! seriously go now!	10
 Sentimental but Solid	Shank's a layman's classic. Talk to friends and family and the name comes up as a favorite. The film has a tight structure and a nice rise in tension, and we like the cast of characters. But what makes this a favorite is a gimmick. At the finish-line of the film we feel that rise of exhilaration where all is made equal. The antagonists meet their ends and the heroes escape unscathed. The entire structure of the film moves us and captivates us...Andy, the perfect victim, faces guiltless punishment with little complaint and furrowed hope. Freeman's character smiles in his wise way as counts the weeks he knows he deserves. The film's theme of hope becomes apparent early on, and is not distinct from other 90s dramas. Even so, it works with the film's tensions and transfers that hope to the viewer in an unusually effective way. Sure, its 90s sentimentality, and its not great cinema. But its like a potent glass of wine, and can take our minds off our own problems and drop us into that ever-circling illusion of hope that spurts from arts of this sort.	8
 The best movie I've seen	This movie beyond doubt the best movie I've ever seen.. The plot , the acting , the setting are just amazing. Having said that I do have some negative comments. No , negative isn't the word , perhaps just my opinion on some parts of the film that could have been done better.The first thing that comes to mind is that I thought some bits were a little too predictable. At some points during the movie I guessed what they were going to say and I was right on the money. I didn't get just get the same idea I mean I guessed word for word what they were saying.The second thing that bothered me a little was the ending. I don't want to give anything away but the way 'Red' found it so quickly , I mean of all the fields and brick walls in Bruxton, also the way he found Andy on the beach was just ... I donno I guess I was a little disappointed but I guess they had to make the ending like it is , the film is long as it is ( eh , I guess I'll have to check the spoilers little square thing now ).But hey , who am I to judge.Well I guess that about sums it on the negative points that I thought this film had. I'm not going to state any good points because I'll be here for weeks.	9
 Technically speaking, this is the ultimate cinema achievement		10
" Great movie, but ""The Best Ever""?"	"The Shawshank Redemption is based on a short story by Stephen King. Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is imprisoned in Shawshank Prison for killing his wife and her lover. Inside, he befriends Red (Freeman), another inmate, and keeps making changes around the place, which worries the prison warden.I watched the film when I found out that it had beat ""The Godfather"" to the top position on IMDb's Top 250 movies list. It was great, but I don't quite think it deserves the Nr 1 position. Don't get me wrong, the film is more than worth watching, but there's a lot of movies out there, just as good as this one and there's nothing outstandingly special about this one. It's great, nonetheless, and I can strongly recommend it.9/10"	9
 1990's Movies: A Poignant Film	"The Shawshank Redemption (1994) I've seen this film in its entirety now. Initially, I was afraid it would be a violent prison movie with very little meaning and would have very little to move me to tears. But it did. The film was Oscar worthy but it was a film that lost that year to ""Forest Gump"". Its release on VHS made the film very popular. Cable television airs the film frequently and it's even the stuff that film screenplay classes study as a sample of brilliant movie. Based on the short story by Stephen King ""Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption"" it tells the story of wealthy banker Andy (Tim Robbins) accused of murdering his wife and her lover. The time at the start of the film is the 1940's and by the end of the film it's the 1960's. Andy has been sent to Shawshank, a notorious prison (in Washington state or Oregon) where harsh discipline is provided by the Warden (Bob Gunton) and by its captain of prison guards. The elements of a prison movie are indeed here (nightmarish conditions, cruel punishment, gay prisoners raping straight/hetero prisoners) but it becomes a prison movie at a higher level with its theme of redemption and humanity, hope and perseverance. The bond between Morgan Freeman's character and Tim Robbins is perhaps the most poignant relationship of any two men portrayed on film. The prisoners have lost hope and although not bitter, become very comfortable with prison life and know no other type of life. This was the tragedy of the prison librarian who after decades of prison life, could not cope with the real world that had changed after his release. His suicide is extremely depressing. The ""bad guys"" turn out to be not the criminals who attempt to rehabilitate themselves but the hypocritical and cruel Warden. Andy is innocent as proved by a later inmate's confession to knowing the true culprit (played by Gil Bellows) but the Warden is too bent on keeping his image of having always done justice and keeps Andy in prison. The grim aspects of the film are nevertheless lightened by humor, good writing, nuance in character and scenes that have such power and subtlety. The scene in which Andy plays an opera album (Le Nozze Di Figaro by Mozart, duet ""Sull'aria from the 1968 Karl Bohm album with Edith Mathis and Gundula Janowitz) is so moving and so touching. Andy's subsequent escape and the table-turned justice when the investigation into the corruption of the prison leads to the demise of the administration.This movie ranks as one of the finest made in the 1990's, with excellent writing and fine acting. It's a movie that has become a classic and that continues to hold audiences enthralled."	10

 A Unique Film That Has That Lovely Feeling		9
 An Epic Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is just an utterly moving motion picture that makes you really have a feel for the characters in this movie. It truly will move you in some sort of way, because it is very deeply emotional at times. Morgan Freeman did an excellent job as always and really put on an amazing role in this movie. Tim Robbins truly stole the show with his Grade A performance. If you have the time to sit through this very long movie, then you should definitely see The Shawnshank Redemption, because it is a motion picture that will make you feel in dept emotions for the characters in the movie, it is by far a classic and one of the best movies of the 90's.	10
 A brilliant film any way you look at it	Darabonts film about an innocent banker and his troubles inside a maximum security prison with a tough warden (Gunton). Andy (robbins) befriends an inmate whose friendship gives him hope and is the backbone of the film, Morgan Freeman plays this role superbly in what i think is the actor's best performance of all time. This is Freeman's film, though Robbins is great in the lead and Gunton is a hell of an antagonist. Everything about this film is perfect, so i can completely see why its the 3rd best film of all time on IMDb. I am a big fan and have watched it 5 times and wouldn't mind on seeing it again later down the line. IMDb Rating: 9.2 MY Rating: 10/10	10
 The Ultimate Art		10
 The journey	When the movie starts also starts your journey through what is pure in this life: friendship, hope, courage.This movie is a piece of art from which everybody takes what they need. It gives us understanding of hard work which will be rewarded. It shows that true happiness is what we are working for all our life.Isn't it wonderful, that true feelings and inspiration can visit us just by watching a movie? But don't be mistaking. You aren't just to watch the film. You have to receive it with your heart as much as you receive it with your head.I guarantee that each of us will be smiling. Just like they did.	10

 A must watch		10
 A true masterpiece...	The Shawshank Redemption is honestly one of the greatest movies ever.I was too young when i watched it for the first time and i didn't get much,so i watched it again some months ago.At the end i was left with a feeling of freedom and perhaps redemption.This movie gives you hope,which in my opinion is very importand.It is a movie about human dignity,about always trying to be a better person.The Shawshank Redemption is meant to change the person that watches it.I give it a 10,although it deserves much more.Apart from these,Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are absolutely excellent. If i had to describe their performances with one word that would be overwhelming.Let's hope more movies like this come out.	10
 One of the greatest films of all time.		10
 This movie is perfect.		10
 The movie is better than the book	That's normally pretty hard to say, though the fact that the book is a Stephen King novella (150ish pages +/-) makes sense why the movie is better. Not bashing King here, just saying most of the movies based on his work tend to be pretty decent and novellas aren't meaty enough for my taste. Most the time when I finish a novella I wish there had been more substance.As far as the movie goes, I'm sure everyone else has mentioned why it's so great. If you love this movie check out the book, they're pretty much dead on besides a few details. Unlike other novellas of King's e.g. Apt Pupil ... the extra details in that book made it so much better than the movie.	10
 Needed to be free of shame!		10
 best movie ever	The story is about a banker (andy) innocently serving a life sentence of prison for the murder of his wife and all the incidents that come about in there. I really admired the character of andy who still has the hope of living in a free environment.His a very smart fella with lots of plans in mind about the future yet inside prison. Undoubtedly it is the best movie i have ever seen. The scenes are very delicately chosen. SO many intuitive points in this movie that i recommend multiple watch of it. I really liked the acting which was so natural.It was like a real story.I'm still amazed that why hasn't this movie received any Oscars. I thank the director for such a great movie.	10
 Greatest Soundtrack and Story	I was turned on to this movie by my late uncle Ed. He is forever captured in my memories every time I see this wonderful movie or hear the soundtrack. The Harmonica and orchestra is so intense, it just lives with me forever. Our favorite track was Zihuataneho, it is where we will meet in heaven. Thomas Newmann has created so many beautiful soundtracks, but this is my all time favorite. The greatest ending of any movie, it just lets us know that in the end, justice will be served... When I think of this movie my favorite line is get busy living or get busy dying. Tim Robbins and the warden, am I being obtuse.	10
 One of the most moving Films ever made		10
 Inspirational		10
 Magnificent is the way to describe it.	Yes this is simply a magnificent piece of work which remains powerful and moving and probably always will.It's been 14 years but who can forget such a masterpiece.This is a movie about how strong the human faith and spirit can be.Even in the most difficult moments we have to remain strong and believe in justice.This is what Shawshank is all about.I have never read the Steven King novel but he definitely should be proud that a director such as Frank Darabont has the passion and desire in making a powerful and faithful adaptation to King's work.A moving film with superb performances from all the actors but the real credit goes to Tim Robbins as the wrongfully accused Andy Dufresne whose spirit and will help him find freedom and Morgan Freeman as Ellis 'Red' Redding who serves a life-long sentence but hopes he can be freed from guilt.Throughout the movie we witness much suffering,injustice and sorrow but that's what makes the characters so pleasant and worth sympathizing for.Andy's desire to become a free man again is truly a magical but also difficult adventure.But he never loses his hope and that is what helps him succeed.The final scene when Andy and Ellis meet each other outside the steel cage prison is phenomenal and touching.It is a real shame that a movie so great didn't win a single Oscar although it had 7 nominations.А real unfairness cause this movie is indeed better than Forrest Gump.In conclusion I'll just say that Shawshank is a timeless masterpiece and deserves to be in the top 10 greatest films of all time.	9
 Amazingly Amazing		10
 Stunning. The best movie i have ever seen	The shawshank redemption is the greatest film of all time, in my opinion. Having read great reviews for the film, i was determined to watch it myself. And that was probably the greatest film decision ever made by me. I will never forget the engrossing intensity of this masterpiece, it will stay with me and many others for years to come.It centres around a wrongly convicted prisoner Andy Dufresne and another nicknamed Red by his friends. After Red sees the wrongful imprisonment he becomes Andy's best friend and they create an unbreakable bond that is the core of the film. Years go by in Shawshank prison and the pair live with the tortures of shawshank. The neglect, the murder and the horror.But Andy changes this. He does extraordinary things for the inmates. HE befriends the guards, builds a big library and helps people with their problems. He saves them from institutionalisation.In the end an incredible series of events allows Andy to turn these factors on the prison and to get the responsible people imprisoned themselves. Andy escapes and leaves for a new life abroad. Red is released soon after and follows him. The ending sees them reunited.This is a definitive tale of how the human spirit can be denied nothing.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 Perfection		10
 This is simply one of the best movies ever with superb acting	"I simply do not know how some people out there voted this movie anything less than a 6 or 7, but a small percentage had the audacity to vote it a ""ONE""! There are always that small percentage. Sometimes I believe people vote down other movies in some attempt to get THEIR favorite movie into a certain spot. The fact that people put that much effort into doing so amazes me. I'll take the time to comment on a movie and give my 2 cents worth of opinion. This movie was a classic the day it premiered and the 2nd place showing overall demonstrates that without fault. My hope is those who voted it down somehow obtain a clue."	10
 Well deserved place in the top 250 movies of all time	This movie is well deserving of #2 of all time, if not it should be #1. This movie has #1 most votes cast for any movie, and as anyone should know, the more people that vote, the more accurate the rating should be. As of now May 24th 2007, there is 255,456 people who have rated this movie. 150,715 rate it 10/10.This movie is not over-rated and remains my favorite movie of all time. Why? I can pop this movie in at ANY time and thoroughly enjoy it. There is no other movie that does this for me. And thus will most likely remain my favorite movie of all time. If you have not seen this movie yet, what are you waiting for. BUY IT NOW. You will certainly love it.	10
 NO.2? Should be NO.1!	"This film was so deep. Suicide, murder, innocence, friendship and of course hope.I watched only a bit of this film at one point and thought its alright. But i looked at its rating being no.2 and thought ""really"". I was then desperate to see what makes this film the top of the nineties. Watched it with my family and it simply blew me away. The way it was sad was happy just realising that Andy difference (who was arrested for murdering his wife and her lover when drunk) was all this time innocent after spending 19 years in shawshank prison. its the police that show who are the good guys but in this its the other way round and the way it was done was exciting and intelegant.The scripts was fantastic, the acting was sensational and most of all the story was one the best ever explained in a film (infact the best ever).we all have our opinions but if you think this film is rubbish for no specific reason then there is something wrong with you."	10

 Not bad, but Seriously Overrated		7
 a decent movie but not my Number 2	"I saw this movie mainly because it was rated so highly in IMDb. It was a decent movie but it should not be number 2. It has Morgan Freeman and his wonderful voice so that's certainly a plus. The messages of the bad guys getting it in the end is nice as well as keeping one's hope alive in adverse circumstances. I didn't really think the gestapo like guard, who is able to kill anyone on a whim, was very believable. Even convicted felons have loved ones who would want answers. Besides, guards know that one day the tables may be turned on them and this usually tempers their cruelty. Vicious guards are usually ""dealt with"" by the inmates, so I don't believe a guard like this could last long, and certainly not over 20 years. And how is it that the warden and chief guard are in the same job at the same prison for over 20 years? I don't really buy the massive kickbacks the warden was getting continuously either. Prison labor in the USA usually involve trash picking, farming & soap making for institutional use and license plate stamping. These are not highly profitable industries. Neither was I too thrilled by the subtle cynicism aimed at the Bible and those who read it. Lots of convicts ""get religion"" and it is generally a good thing. Also, the quick series of mini-scenes leading me by the hand through the resolution (baptism by sewage, screaming headlines, screaming sirens, arrests and suicide) seemed fairytale like. At least you can say that the movie raises awareness of the fact that there are wrongly convicted people in prison and that savage inmates beat and rape each other. I did like the demeanor of the main character, Andy, our victim cum hero. A mix of being quiet, brooding, deliberate, cautious, willful, sly and subdued. This is a nobler hero than what you see in many Hollywood movies. And Morgan's performance as Red reminds us that, felon or not, inmates are still quite capable of humanity. So in general, I didn't mind watching this movie. It entertained me. I just wouldn't include it in my list of best movies. I would not want to watch it again."	5
 An Underrated Masterpiece		10
 Didn't really do it for me, I'm afraid	"I remember when I first watched this film being surprised at how highly regarded it was by my work colleagues (and by many other people too), so I must have missed the point. Can someone really dig his way out of prison in the manner that ""our hero"" did? I thought there was generally a policy that people were moved around from cell to cell over time; and what about the suspect premise that he was able to keep his escape tunnel hidden with posters - which no-one ever checked behind! How did he keep them in place whilst he was in the tunnel? How did he dispose of the material he dug out? Surely it's all too far-fetched. Am I being too pedantic; should I really just be acknowledging the film's uplifting storyline? Some people I spoke with told me that it was based on a true story - it's not .On balance, I far preferred Mr King's ""The Green Mile""."	
 Overrated	This is by no means a bad movie, but it's certainly not as great as many people claim. I have watched it a couple of times already now and I just don't see what's so brilliant about it. The story is good, but not excellent. The acting of the biggest part of the cast is good, but I really can't identify myself with Andy, the main character. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, while being innocent. Though, he just doesn't do it for me. You would expect me to feel sympathy for him, because of his situation. To a certain degree I do of course, as I do with anyone who is done injustice. But that is not enough, that's why I think this movie is overrated.	7
 this is the greatest movie of all time	This is the best movie of all time. It has a great cast in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. This is the greatest movie based of a book I have ever seen. Every character filled every role to the best they could and they all did great. When you first watch this movie you think the story is about Tim Robbins character but when you watch it a second time you actually see that its a story about Morgan Freeman. I love this movie and always will. Watch this movie its the best there ever was. Also Tim Robbins should have won an Oscar for his performance in this movie. I give this movie ****/****. This truly is the best movie of all time, it is definitely better than The godfather.	10
 Patience doesn't mean to submit	"One of the most satisfying movies ever. Anyone who has seen this film is being gradually overwhelmed by the injustice towards a single man; and while the scenario unfolds a grim, but also an unpredictable future, the hero reveals at the end his so far unrealistic stance in everything inside the prison. Redemption is not a utopia on this film. A scarce thing to see in the majority of today's movies. It perfectly reflects an every day person's point of view in assessing things and his life by ""get busy living or get busy dying"". And although it contains some dramatic characters, it gives the final sensation to the audience that hope can really change things, no matter the costs involved. A sensation that is amiss from today's movies, which try to present a realistic ending or character. Movies were not made to be totally realistic and this movie proves it magically."	10
 Lets keep things in perspective	First of all i enjoyed this film immensely. It was well shot, highly emotive and contained two great lead performances, but the fact remains that this movie is perhaps too overrated in the grand scheme of cinema.It must not be forgotten that this film is an adaptation of a short story and as such the narrative requires a little more depth. One should also take into account the film's cult status as a sleeper hit (which never the less underlines its definite quality) as reason to be cynical over its actual significance in American popular cinema.However, the film is undoubtedly one of the finest examples of the prison genre, certainly ranking alongside the likes of Cool Hand Luke. The relationship of the main protagonists is perhaps one of the reasons for this as is the movies themes and contextual references. As a result this is a fine picture which inspires its audience to question justice and honour in a non too clichéd way.	10

I often saw commercials advertising the film on TNT, but never had enough interest to sit and watch until I bought the movie for my fiancée. I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. This is easily one of the greatest films of all time. I couldn't believe the outstanding job done by all of the actors. I've seen very few scripts on the level of this one, but have never seen so many strong performances from the entire cast.Morgan Freeman is incredible as Red and narrates the action better than any other voice-over I've ever heard. I was very surprised with Tim Robbins. For some reason I still thought of him as Nuke Laloosh and never dreamed he had this kind of acting ability. The story is incredible and the dialogue keeps the entire film rolling. Two and a half hours go by like nothing. I also have to applaud William Sadler, who showed great versatility (watch Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey or Die Hard 2 to see what I mean). The film is intriguing as well as inspiring at the same time. I found myself inwardly cheering for Andy to escape from Shawshank and was even happy when he is shown emerging from the sewer tunnel. His reunion with Red is almost tearjerking. The movie managed to have a happy ending without it seeming to be another unrealistic Hollywood Ending.This film is definitely a must-see. I have seen Braveheart, and though I thought it was fantastic it doesn't come anywhere near the power of Shawshank Redemption. I doubt another cast ensemble of incredible acting talent will ever match this one. Easily a 10 on the IMDb.com scale.	10
 This is surely one of the most incredible movies in history...	This movie can not come recommended highly enough, the fact that it is constantly near to, or at the top of the Internet Movie Database's top 250 poll, is surely testament to this.This is definitely one of my favourite movies of all time. If you are reading these comments, and have not seen this life changing movie (for both the film's characters AND the viewer), i truly envy you.It is one of the few movies that I would wish that I have never seen, purely so I could have the pleasure of seeing it again for the first time and re-living how i felt after the credits rolled. It really is that good.	10
 The greatest film ever made!	"This is the greatest film ever made ..... bar none! It has everything you could ever want in a film and more! The story is quite different to the short story by Stephen King but thats not necessarily a bad thing as the Green Mile followed the book closely and wasn't nearly as good as this! It says if you can to think of a film to compare it to but its in a genre all of its own. Other good prison films I could suggest are ""Against the Wall"" and ""Killer: A Journal of Murder"". Both of these are good but lack the depth of characters portrayed in Shawshank. For a good prison televisual drama then ""Oz"" has to be the best thing to come out of America after the Simpsons, it has the characters and plots to match Shawshank but generally without the feel good factor thrown in."	10
 A Great film, Outstanding Acting and Story! Instant Classic!	This film gave me a great feeling at the end. My mother thought it wouldn't be my typical everyday action movie, I saw the recommendations and had a look at it. I was amazed, and so was my mum. At the end I saw her on the edge of her seat yelling at Morgan Freeman to do what Tim Robbins had said.I recommend this movie very much. It is a sad, funny at times and it is most importantly, Heart warming. For those of you that haven't seen it I tell you now, this is the best movie of the Nineties.Just another thing, I saw Forrest Gump and that was not as good as this. The Shawshank Redemption should have won the Oscars!	10
 Freedom and brave		
 This is my view of The Shawshank Redemption		
 Something about this film caught me	This movie became my favorite movie of all time, before i had even seen the whole thing. Has this happened to anyone else? I had seen parts on TV and that was it. The day i finally rented it, i was practically jittery with excitement. This just tells you about my unique subjective experience with it. After it was over, I wasn't dissatisfied in the least. It is truly a great film all around. It is one of those things where part of me wants everyone in the world to see it, but another part of me feels like my personal experience with it makes it my own. I don't want to write an extensive review and put it under some kind of lens and analyze it. I'll just say that from that day forward, The Shawshank Redemption had profoundly affected the way I view movies and it his been the gateway into my current passion for films.	10
 hope		
 Masterpiece	This film is one of the top 5 in my own ranking. It's just amazing, and if you get the chance to see this movie, don't miss it. In particular, it would be the best choice if you don't want to see the typical super production from Hollywood. The plot makes you think about life, its pleasures and its pains.I took one clear message from this masterpiece film: everything is possible with patience and constancy. Trust me -- you'll enjoy the greatest cinema ever. Enjoy!!

 My lifetime movie	"Spoiler Alert Shawshank Redemption hit the movie world in 1994.It touched the hearts of the filmgoers like no other movie.It is no longer just a movie but has become a vivid legend .I love this movie very much, it is the story of a lifetime.It tells a story that Andy Coufresne, a banker ,who has been convicted falsely of murdering his wife and her lover.But he never lost his faith to be innocent again.Through two turbulent decades of his life in jail,viewing the darkness of jail and the coldness of the world.He learnt to deal with loneliness ,desperation ,unfairness.Exactlly,Andy is the embodiment of an era, an innocent at large in a world that is losing its innocent.But his irony strength and kindness known what he could.Armed with his high IQ ,irnoy will and kind nature to versus the world's cruelty.I admire his strong character and faith,Andy is a person of great determination,who is burdering the greatest insult and facing the fallen from a freeman to a personier.No one can see the beauty of the world and touch the gender of the sunshine but Andy.The movie give the inspiration to us all and a sense of the redemption in our soul.In this movie ,friendship is also brilliant,Red ,a black, Andy , a white, they communicated from the bottom of the heart to corss the racial discrimination.At the end of the movie,we can see that they embrace warmthly by the seashore .A prefect ending in the background with blue sea and white sky.Everything is in harmony ,as beautiful as a rainbow after storm.""Hope is a good thing,maybe the best of the things,no good thing ever dies."" Andy said to us. This is a kind of spirit we need in our way to be self-esteem.All in all,Shawshank Redemption is the movie we need in our lifetime."	
 I like this movie,and Andy,his spirit is my aim for my life!		
 A good film		
 THE BEST I HAVE EVER SEEN		
 its just okay	"Like picasso,chaplin and the beatles the sycophantic veneration of this ""icon"" is a complete mystery.Its a decent film - but it certainly isn't a great one,its no better than escape from alcatraz,brubaker,i escaped from a chain gang, but that doesn't matter to the cinematic lemmings vainly looking for prestige and kudos about a run of the mill film glorified by movie luvvies.Even trailer park trash have got in on the act"" my favorik filum iz da shawshank regemshun"". -thats when i knew the farcical proportions of overrated glorification this film had reached.Its supposed to be about ""liberation,emancipation....blah blah you know the usual poncey guff thats trotted out for meaningless symbolism and metaphor.Luvvies love a movie voice over commentary,aka scorcese - why ,who knows?.But the film does have a potent manipulative power - which was also used by another weakish film -the shining, and that is the pathos laden empowering music score- this is what so brilliantly fools gullible viewers sadly.In the final analysis how can a film be great when it contains a ridiculous scene of a prisoner(robbins) immobilising a whole prison full of violent incarcerated males by playing opera- and yet he doesn't even receive a rightly deserved mother of all beatings"	
 The movie named the shawshank redemption told us a story about a banker called Andy Dufresne who is convicted and jailed for the murder of his wife. His life is changed.		
 This movie tells us a tale that takes place during the 1940's in a horror prison called Shawshank.		
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 The second most perfect non-action film...		10
 Good, but....	I know that other people's votes shouldn't influence mine, either way--but geez, No.2 of all time? What are the IMDb demographics that create that overblown result?I thought this was a very entertaining movie, somewhere around 8 points. But the script is kind of sugary and the characters lack the subtlety you would expect in a truly great drama. The ending reminded me of The Great Escape.There are several good performances that aren't quite able to shake loose the limitations of the script and become stirring.Cute, but not the greatest prison drama ever. I think there must be a lot of teenagers voting on IMDb.	7
 Believe the hype		10
 This is supposed to be good???!!!???		10
 one of the greatest	yes this movie is one of the greatestThis movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need to be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice to his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for the parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was tremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one of the best.prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my perspective has changed about that. I rate this movie 10/10 its the best, the story is great and the director does a great job. well done	10
 One of the best movies ever	"If you haven`t seen this film, watch it as soon as you can. Maybe you`ve had the chance to do it, but just skipped it because you thought it was one more story in prison. Yes and no! YES because most part of ""Shawshank Redemption"" happens in a prison, but NO, it's not like the others. It's much better.The story, you may know more of it in the Plot Outline, is really interesting and the performances are just impossible to forget. There is a little of everything: drama, friendship, violence, love and dream...""Dream of Freedom"". That's the title in Portuguese.My Rate 9/10"	9
 There are some truths everyone agree like this film for everyone a MASTERPIECE	Some truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people. You may not love Lord of the Rings, Star Wars,Braveheart, Love stories, Grease or any big movie but YOU LOVE THIS. LOOK in IMDb it is in the second place but look how many people voted, more than 120000 voted so this is the secret first movie. It stimulates your neurons, something changes inside you. White, black, yellow, American, European, African all people meet in some ways. THE BIGGEST EXAMPLE IS SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, everyone likes it -few exceptions. I sometimes think that we are all humans that are created in a way that we love this movie (or Darabont-director is not human so he made the movie for us to love it)Go talk to others ask about films then ASK ABOUT SHAWSHANK and see the change on their features then catch the smile of people when you talk about SHAWSHANK.Some truths not much but a few are accepted by nearly every people (beginning as finish) (finish as beginning)	10
 Positive Comments	This Is My Absolute Favorite Movie Of All Time. When This Movie First Came Out In Theaters, I was still in Middle School And Thought That It Looked Pretty Stupid, Boy was I WRONG! Some Of the Best Performances I've Ever Seen Given In A Movie, Heart Wrenching Emotion, And Most Of All Hope. No Matter What Never Give Up Hope. This Movie Changed My Life. Before I Saw This Movie I Was A Troublemaker Who Did Poorly In School. After I saw This Movie I Tried Harder To Be A Better Person, A Person Who Always Did My Best. I Believe This Movie Has Helped Me Get To Where I Am, A Happy, Hard Working, Hopeful Person, & That Is Perhaps The Best Of Things. I Would Appreciate Any Feed Back From People Who Appreciate This Film As Much As I Do.	10
 You've got to be kidding me (but I know you're not)...	I am dumbfounded by the exorbitant praise for this movie. It is almost frightening--like a cult.  I watched it last night and was completely underwhelmed.  This did not have have half the emotional charge of a dozen other prison flicks, not to mention other dramatic categories.  Yes, the story was OK, good (not great) acting, but I found it to be largely insipid and predictable.  It just did not grab me like other stories of redemption such as A Christmas Carol or It's a Wonderful Life.  As you can see by my citing these two films, I am not offended by cheesy sentimentality, if well done.  Shawshank simply had nothing new to say or a new way to say it.  The only reason I am writing this review is to demonstrate that there are indeed some people who are not swept away by this movie.  Otherwise, I would not have bothered.  The film simply was not interesting enough.	
 Life in Shawshank		
 good, not best.	I can understand why this film is loved so much, but I can equally understand, although I do not agree, why it is despised. People say it is life affirming, brings hope and happiness, and it does, others say it is sentimental crap, and at times it is. But I've always been a sucker for sentimental movies, ones which have the power to genuinely move the viewer, and not hide under a cheap plot and a tragic death. Being another King adaptation, there is violence, and hardness to counteract the sentimentality, and the prison, although not as horrifying as those seen in Midnight Express and other movies, breaks the human soul to the point that it relies on the prison for survival. Heartbreaking, tear jerking, brutally funny, all phrases used repeatedly to describe this film, all appropriate. A film everyone should love. Great Quotes: Andy. 'I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged' 9 out of 10	9
 My take on the film		10
 Where do I start?	Well... this is the cat out of the bag. Pandora's box opening. Why did I ever find a critique site. I'm one of the most opinionated stubborn sh...uhh so and so's.... in the world.So I guess first and foremost did I like it. No!..........Just kidding. How can you fail to? Its my favourite movie of all time. It has just occurred to me that this may be my first ever sober critique of the film. It's one of those movies confined to the small, smokey, pokey corners of a pub when the issue of greatest film of all time comes up. There's always a 'goodfellas' and a 'Godfather trilogy' and an 'Empire Strikes back' 'Labyrinyth' (?) Voice in the crowd ,(I mix in strange circles) But its fairly unanimous, everyone likes this film. So why?Where do I start. Morgan Freeman...Goes without saying. Tim Robbins...Not sure anyone else could play Dufresne now. Bob Gunton....Born to play evil. William sadler...Under-rated.But it's not really the actors or the Director/photography etc. It's the script. Beautifully constructed. It flows like liquid perfection. Morgan Freeman's VO helps no end. (Brad Pitt described it in 'Se7en' commentry as the voice of god).I had the fortune to watch this before the hype. I got it out on video the day it came out cause I was a fan of Morgan Freeman. I sat there in silence for fifteen minutes after the final credit had scrolled past my screen. It's that good. Breathtaking. (spoiler) When Red wanders across that beach and we see Dufresne there, and the camera slowly pans upwards and away, you know you've been part of something special. I'm not a fan of sickly sweet 'hollywoodised' endings but every now and then they get it right.I should stop now cause I could go on for ever. (The 'record' scene, Brook's parole, the 'beers on the roof', the 'poster', the 'salvation comes from within' rock hammer).I better stop there. Need to take a tablet. See thats why they shouldn't make movies this good.Yeah I quite liked it then.Don't mind and comments/critique/feedback. The e-mails there.	10
 good, but overrated	"This film offers pretty visuals, good-acting and an interesting screenplay.But it´s a movie very overrated among IMDB users, who put it at the 2th place on best movies list.The explanation is simple the old ""fight for your dreams"", ""never give up"" motive, which thrills and delight audiences.SPOILERS AHEAD For me, the movie doesn´t work in this way. At the end, the protagonist is old, he had been raped, bitten, etc. The final doesn´t work for me in a full happy end, the main time of his life has already gone!"	7
 How Great is this film?	I first saw SR in america when i was 12. I walked in on the tariing scene and had to stay up untill two in the morning to finish watching it. I was hooked! When i came back to england i rushed out and bought the Video in order to see the beginning part. it is such a great movie. i have seen the movie about 250 times since then and have read the short story about 100 times. it is so good! if you haven't seen it yet, make sure you do. You are missing out on one of the greatest cinematic treats in history!	10
 A Truly Great Movie	This film is based on one of my favourite Stephen King novels (albeit a 'novella') The original book contained four long 'short stories' one which became 'Stand By Me' (another great movie) and 'Rita Heyworth & The Shawshank Redemption' which has been (full marks to the director& production team)lovingly rendered into a true cinematic masterpiece. Staying true to the printed word, it follows the prison life of Andy Dupree from sentence to freedom with care and sympathy, never revelling in his hardships or flouting his attempts at beating the system. The film concentrates on his will to survive and his hope for eventual freedom. Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman were born to play their respective parts in this film. If neither had ever made another film, it would not matter because this film will always be their mark in movie history. No major action sequences, no breathtaking special effects and no outrageous subject matter. Just a great movie, based on a great story, acted convincingly with great skill by two men who could really be the best of friends the story requires them to be. Superb.	10
 Beautifull,inspiering and an emotional ride of hope and freedom!	I love this film so much,it is my all time favourite movie,and I really dont think any film will have such a profound effect on me.It almost inspires you to do almost anything,and the tagline alone has a mystic and philisophical feel about it(Fear can hold you prisoner,Hope can set you free!).The great thing about this film is that it can represent anything that has happend in your life,good or bad.I think that is what gives an edge to this film,of which many films forget to include!It's quite funny to think that this film was a huge flop at the box office,and that it wasnt untill the film came out on VHS that it really got the world wide recognition that it so truly deserved!Beautifully made,inspiring and an emotional ride of hope and freedom!I absolutely love it,best film ever!!!!!!!!Stu.	10
 TOP 5 EVER !	Wonderful touching story that will make you cry AND feel extremely good inside. STEVEN KING proves that he is one of the best story writers EVER.Superb acting by Freeman et al. Wonderful narrative, music, cinematorgraphy and backward looking story that escalates throughout the film.A work of genious, J	10
 The Greatest Movie of all Time !!		10
 Certainly not #2	I watched this movie today, and while it was good it certainly IS NOT the #2 best Drama of all time.  I hope that more people will sign up for IMDB after seeing this and start to post your user ratings as I would give it a good rating, but certianly not a 9.	8
 MARVELOUS	"This is perhaps one of the best movies I have ever seen and no doubt the best of Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont created a masterpiece.It is a very intelligent story telling us how hard prison life can be. It critics the judgements of innocent prisoners. But the most I liked is that every time there is another interesting story that develops in this prison. At the last third of the movie we can enjoy the big surprise or the dessert. This novel is very nice told and it merits standing ovation. I and my wife rarely see such films. This is quality of film making and today where we are?   8.5/10.If you liked this don´t miss another masterpiece from the same director called ""THE GREEN MILE""."	8
 The best movie i've ever seen	The shawshank redemption is probably the one of the best films ever depicted in cinematic form.  It is the most controversial and sad film I've ever seen; second is American history x.  I loved this film and I thought Tim Robbins was excellent and Morgan Freeman as well.  Let me just say to that everybody should see this film.  I give it 4/4	
 The Greatest Movie That I Have Ever Seen	"**SOME MINOR SPOILERS**I was like some other people in that I have had never seen ""The Shawshank Redemption"" until 2 nights ago.  Now, I just got done watching it for the 2nd straight night in a row.  How anyone can say that this movie is overrated is beyond me; it is almost like they want to say that to be different!The acting is outstanding by everyone involved including Robbins, Freeman, Sadler, Gunton, Brown, etc.  Maybe the most chilling scene is when Tommy reveals to Red and Andy about how he had a cellmate at another prison reveal to him about that time ""he killed that golf pro and that b*tch he was knocking up"".  There was something about that scene in how Darabont filmed it with the lighting and the laugh of that guy.  It left an impression on me.  It also was the turning point of the movie, although you could tell from the very beginning that Andy was not like any other convict.One thing that sorta bothered me was near the end when it was revealed to the press about all the stuff going on at Shawshank, how it was so quick for Norton, Hadley, etc. to get theirs.  I mean how did Andy really accomplish this without giving himself away and how did they not trace his whereabouts or question him?  Oh well, I guess wondering about one thing like that is not too bad.  Normally, there are like 5 things or more that I wonder about in every movie, but that is why it is a movie, I guess.At any rate, don't let the above paragraph ruin it for you...I'm just a weirdo after all...:)  The music, camera angles, lighting, acting, etc. are all outstanding.This is a movie that needs to be watched over and over again and should be treasured.  There is a reason for it being ranked #2 all-time, people. It's that good.  If you wind up enjoying this movie, I recommend another Darabond movie based on a Stephen King work in ""The Green Mile"".  It is a little-bit more fantasy than Shawshank but it is an outstanding movie."	
 Why does everyone think this is so good?	"I've seen this movie two times now, and must say I quite enjoyed it. But when I see all the user comments, consistently expressing how ingenious and brilliant this movie is, amazement overwhelms me.The storytelling is rather one-dimensional and straightforward, something like a story for children. I fail to see any brilliance at all in the plot.(spoilers)What is the deal with the David vs Goliath story anyway? You can beat everyone as long as you have hope and patience? And why is everyone talking about this ""get busy living or busy dying""? Come on, people, that's philosophy for teenagers, you can do better!What if the warden, for instance, would have ordered to remove the posters after one of Dufraisne's wrongdoings? I know I would have! And what if, somewhere during those 19 years, anyone would have heard him digging? I know I would, with the great acoustics such a prison should have, and how silent everything is at night?Bottom line: this story is far from brilliant and really isn't very deep. Within 10 years it will disappear from the top 50 (when all the voters have grown up and lower their score by two or three points)."	
 One of the most overrated movies of all times!!	"Don't get me wrong i think the movie is good. but it's not great i mean there were much better movies in 1994 ""Ed Wood"", ""Heavenly Cratures"", ""Pulp Fiction"", etc. i mean there is nothing special about this movie it's very conventional..... i give it *** 0ut of *****"	
 Religious musings?		10
 Quite simply the most beautiful film ever made	"Although a long film, and for the most part not light hearted, I am able to watch ""The Shawshank Redemption"" again and again and to this day I can't find fault with it. It was a brave film to make because if it hadn't been made and acted so well, some parts could have been very tacky. One thing I like about the film is the way in which it shows the convicts to be normal people who have made mistakes, not monsters. It emphasised how everybody deserves rights, even if they are in prison. It is an emotional rollercoaster for me making my heart break or swell with happiness. That sounds tacky, but it's not if you've seen the film."	10
 One of the best movies ever done	This is a great movie. At first, when I heard that Stephen King was one of the authors I didn't expect it to be this good, I don't enjoy horror movies but later I understood that it wasn't a horror movie so I watched it and I enjoyed every minute of it. Excellent performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins.	10
 JUST PERFECT	A movie about life, about freedom and about friendship. This movie is just perfect. I've seen it a lot of times and I just can't get enough of it. Each time i see it, i learn something else. This movie gives you a different meaning about freedom. Great performances of Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, and perfectly directed too.	
 Andy Dufresne - Christ figure? Just a thought		
 A wonderful piece of work	Proof, along with _Delores Claiborne_ and _Stand by Me_ that Stephen King can spin a fine tale when he sets his mind to it. Even having read the book (this is one case where the movie is better), Robbins and Freeman's performances were so captivating that the ending still took me by surprise. Definitely one of the best.	8
 Excellent, One of the Best of all time	What an excellent movie!!!  This has to be one of the best of all time. Morgan Freeman is excellent as always.  Tim Robbins was superb.  I've always believed Robbins was a decent actor, but he superceded any expectations I had.  The movie is a real feel good movie.  I recommend it for anyone over 15.	
 All-time favorite	I run the risk of disappointing new viewers of this film by praising it as one of my all time favorites. One should view this movie with little preconception, and let it do its thing in its own time and way. People critique it for being slow paced, but time plays such an important part of this film--the pacing is hardly accidental. This is one of those films that is hard to fault for technique or failure to convey intent. About the only way you can object is if you don't agree with its outlook on life. I too, am surprised at how many of my friends and family list this as one of their top films--independent/prior to any cajoling on my part! I'm eagerly anticipating the DVD release of this film--I've purposely kept from watching my VHS copy any more so that I can experience the movie and its wonderful score all over again on DVD.	10
 My All-Time Favorite Film	This film is a masterpiece. It manages to wrench the viewer through every emotion possible. With Morgan Freeman's ardent narration and Tim Robbins' masterful expressions, Director Frank Darabont has taken a short description by Stephen King and crafted it into something that deserves to be seen by everyone.	10
 The best Stephen King movie	Stephen King's stories usually do not translate well to movies (Carrie, The Running Man), but occasionally, a King story is done right (Shining, Stand By Me).  This movie is probably the best of the group.  It's a brilliant story matched with a brilliant screenplay.  The cast was great from the professionals (Robbins, Freeman) to the relatively unknown actors.  This movie is about a man's will to survive even when his future looks the darkest.  One of my all time favorite movies.	10
 Robbins and Freeman excellent with magnificent supporting cast		8
 a timeless classic	quite simply, the shawshank redemption is my absolute, long-standing, favourite film, and i know it always will be.  it is a timeless masterpiece that transcends genres, a film that can appeal to everyone with its simple message - hope is important.	10
 Great film!!	One of the most beautiful movies I ever seen. Everyone has to see it.	10
 The best movie ever made	"This survey proves that the American Film Institute's ""Top 100"" and Hollywood's ""Academy Awards"" are nothing but a fraud.  Like many others, I did not go see this movie in the theater because Forrest Gump was out at the same time, hogging all the publicity. What a shame.  This movie should have swept the Oscars for best picture, best acting (lead and supporting), best directing, best screenplay....etc.I simply could not believe it when I saw that the AFI Top 100 did not include this picture at all.  It is simply the best film ever made.  Given the highly different tastes of individuals, it is rare that you can ask friends and acquaintances what the best movie that they have ever seen is and consistently hear the response: ""The Shawshank Redemption.""  Everything, every scene, in this movie works.  With the exception of special effects (this film does not need them), this is the movie all others should be measured against."	10
 One of the best films of the 1990's		10
 Good, but not great	Okay, i am obviously in the minority here, but i would not place this movie even among my top 100. Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script. But i honestly can not see why this movie is appreciated so well; the cinematography is not that great and i have seen many more emotionally involving/uplifting movies as well, just think of The great dictator, The celebration (Festen), Leaving Las Vegas, etc.. 7/10	6
 Very Touching		6
 the greatest motion picture ever made	This film truly captivates the way hope can set anyone free from their obstacles.  I truly enjoyed this movie.  It is most probably the greatest film there is.	10
 Brilliant.	Simply put, this was one of the most brilliant, unbelievable films I have ever seen.  I had never read the Stephen King novella, but in a way I'm glad I didn't.  I honestly can't think of a single thing I would criticize about this movie:  the acting was amazing, the dialogue incredible, the score moving.  I knew a lot of people who hadn't seen this, and I recommended it to all of them.  Most of them came back and told me how much they loved it and they couldn't believe they hadn't seen it sooner.  This is one of those movies that will be remembered forever by those who have seen it.  Those who haven't are definitely missing out on a superb piece of work.  I enjoy it more every time I see it, and can't believe it didn't win the Oscar (it deserved many!) when it first came out.	
 Words aren't enough, you just have to see it	One of the most wonderfully perfect movies of all time, you wouldn't want to change a single frame.Paul	10
 From Novella to the Screen	"I've read the novella from ""Different Seasons,"" and feel that Frank Darabont's screenplay was an excellent refinement of King's story.  It pretty much sticks with the original plot while eliminating some portions which didn't add much to the story as a whole.  The only part I wish they would have included (that they didn't) was Red's tales of other breaks at Shawshank Prison, if only for the novelty of them. Regarding the movie alone, I thought the grand aerial views of the prison combined with Thomas Newman's score (especially the 'Stoic Theme') were quite wonderful, almost breathtaking in their scope and power.  I would have to say this is by far Tim Robbins' best role to date while it at least is among Morgan Freeman's top three cinematic performances. I have seen this movie several times, and although I'd say the first viewing is the best, I never tire of experiencing the story of Andy and Red, their story of hope."	10
 Top-Notch. Must-see.	This is one of the best movies I've seen. I was never bored, or lost interest, even though it's not an action movie. I'd recommend it for anyone. Proof that Stephen King doesn't just write horror.	10
 The Power of Hope.	"The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film about the power of hope. Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is one of those rare characters in American cinema that inspires one to live with conviction, tenacity, and poetry. The relationship between he and Red (Morgan Freeman) echoes the deep friendship found in the Biblical story of Jonathan and David. Truly a film to watch again and again. ""Get busy living, or get busy dying."""	10

 The second best movie of all time.		10
 Excellent	It makes me wonder how people can bash this movie and then rate such mediocre films above it. One thing we have to remember - yes, it's rated #1.  Why? Because it is rare to find a person out there who hated it. Thus, it makes sense that it is ranked #1 - it has the highest AVERAGE RATING of all films voted upon here.I loved the movie.  And I didn't think that it was that hard to believe that there are men in prison who regret their crimes - much less that there were men in prison in the 60s that regretted their crimes.Incredible that people use this space to rip on the movie because of it's number one status instead of giving it an honest review. Love it or like it, Shawshank is a good movie.	10
 Without a Doubt, One of the Greatest Movies I have Ever Seen	The Shawshank Redemption is an absolutely terrific movie that shows why Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are two of the finest actors alive today.  I predict years from now Shawshank will be held up as a true American classic. This is a flawless film.  My one regret is that I never saw this on the big screen.  (I think the odd name 'Shawshank Redemption' and the fact that it was a Stephen King story kept me away initially [thank goodness for cable TV])  I urge anyone who reads this to please see this movie.  It is the best film I have ever seen about life and hope.	10
 I'd rate it higher, but 10's the top.	Wow!  This is a great film, one which surpasses anything I or anyone else could ever say about it.  Truly one of the best films ever.	10
 Great Adaptation	"This movie was a great adaptation of a great novella.  Unlike many other movies made from books, this movie captured was almost an exact match.A great commentary on how a person's environment can make them do strange things.  I think Andy said something like ""I wasn't a criminal until I got to prison.""Great movie!"	10
 Steven King wrote this?	"Absolutely the best movie I have seen in my lifetime.  I'm a hardcore action fan, but I sat and watched this movie and never checked the time.  This movie is compelling.  Tim Robbins gives a great performance nonetheless, but it is Morgan Freeman's character that adds such emotion to the movie.  I always catch the movie on TNT and I watch it to the end.  The end is fantastic, and it leaves me with tingles (if you know what I mean). Morgan Freeman's line ""Get busy living, or get busy dying..."" is one to remember. He adds so much feeling to the movie, and the entire thing is flawless. There isn't a line or scene out of place in the entire thing.  I sat there thinking hard about the movie for a while, but then I got up and headed to the nearest shop.  That movie was going to be my own."	10
 Perfect	Shawshank may not be the best film of all time, but for me it was perfect. A film is perfect (for me) if it shows a character who wins against insurmountable odds (Robbins). Another essential ingredient for a perfect film is a character who, by his actions, changes the life of another human being for the better (again, Robbins). The last 15 minutes of the film are so gripping: we don't know what is going to happen to Freeman, but we are so involved at this point that any other ending would be unthinkable. I loved this film!	
 Greatest film of all time?		9
 Why it's Number 1		9
 Folks using the IMDB know what they're talking about!	"If anyone has any doubts about how great this movie is...just look at the number of votes, the average of them, and read all the user comments.  It was a crime not to award this movie the Oscar in 1994.  I have used the IMDB for two years...at least...and Shawshank is consistently in the top three; the only exceptions being when one of those over-advertised ""hype"" movies is fresh in the box office.  To anyone who has not witnessed near perfection in movie-making, just rent this movie and think about how you feel as the credits start to roll at the end.  I'd go out on a limb to say that anyone who isn't moved emotionally to a higher level after seeing this movie is probably a robot.In my opinion, it's not the number one movie of all time (please see Holy Grail) but it is a very close second!  And, I believe the AFI should pay attention and make this movie its first amendment to the top 100 of all time."	10
 Simply brilliant.	I rented the Shawshank Redemption after reading many of the comments on this very page, and I have to agree: this movie is absolutely brilliant: great acting, great direction, great writing, and one of the most moving story lines ever. I give it a 20 out of 10.	10
 EXCELLENT. Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film about the human condition and a man's battle to not lose his humanity.		10
 living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank,	"i'm sorry for watching this great film by a pirate video cd, that's the only way i can approach movies like this, because i live in china. in this place, you can only see a hollywood movie like ""true lie"" those having radical actions in it. i watched this movie when all my family were sleeping, for none of them likes this movie, they have no patience to continue watching movie like this with no action. and i really touched, in some extents living in china is somewhat like living in shawshank, you need hope and endurance to keep on, i got a lot from this movie, thanks to the director to tim robbins and morgan freeman,and the vendor who recommend the video cd to me."	
 It's a 10 Plus	Such a gripping story -- innocent people do get locked up, 'ya know -- and it's so very sad...  I loved the end of the movie.  Very realistic, I'm afraid -- I pray it makes criminals think twice before thinking that prison is tolerable - and I wish our criminal justice system would wake up and make some corrections.  People need rehabilitation, not torture.	10
 Very powerful movie	This is an amazing movie.  The acting is incredible and the screenplay and direction are amazing.  Extremely powerful and pretty depressing, it actually has a pretty heartwarming kind of ending and the way everything ties together at the end is simply brilliant.  You must see this movie, definitely one of the better movies I've ever seen.	10
 One of the best films I've ever seen.	I've been watching 15 to 30 films a month for the past 5 to 10 years, and I evaluate a film by its ability to captivate my senses, regardless of how many times I've seen it. I don't have to tell you, then, how much I've adored this film. I suppose, for the sake of public appeal, Forrest Gump deserved the Oscar win, but Shawshank deserved the nomination, and Tim Robbins should've at least been nominated for best actor. What can I say? See the film- it's pure artistic perfection.	10
 OVERRATED! I don't feel sorry for anyone in this movie!	Shawshank is by far the most grossly overrated films of all time. To say that this is better than Lawrence of Arabia, better than Alien, Better then Saving Private Ryan, is just ridiculous. This movie is weak, as are all the characters in it. I'll never forgot the scene where the old man hangs himself after leaving prison and the piano symphony kicks in. Why should I feel sorry for him? Try living in Africa buddy and tell me how hard your life is. This movie is for weak people who love to shed a tear for prisoners and overall just weak people. Now I love the director of this and Stephen King, but im sorry, this isn't a masterpiece, it's forcing the audience into the characters emotional problems that few can relate. Go see the Green Mile instead.Rating = D-VideoGameHollywood.com	1
 One of the Most Overrated Films Ever Made!	It seems that every time a movie comes out with an exceedingly positive and uplifting message or story, the average moviegoer is blind to any other problems or shortcomings the film might have. Every moment of this film feels phony and hollow. The character of Red (Morgan Freeman) is just a vehicle to keep the plot moving and doesn't seem to even exist as a whole person. His narration is embarrassing with its phony regional dialect and forced folksiness. The prison life depicted, while brutal and violent in a few scenes, is overromanticized by the picturesque cinematography and florid music. The plot is fairly clever but, like bad American television, everything that happens is in service of the plot. There's no behavior from the characters that doesn't help bring you to the film's stunningly maudlin final scene. And there are logistical problems, like the fact that you can't make a hole in a thick metal sewer pipe by hitting it with a rock three times. They could have solved this problem by just showing a shot of a clock moving forward. The best character is a relatively brief and peripheral one, Brooks (James Whitmore). Whitmore doesn't seem to know he's in such a shallow, contrived movie and gives the character a realism and three-dimensionality the other characters don't have in his short time on screen. In the montage-type scene in which he's trying to cope with life out of prison, however, he suddenly seems less intelligent and more of a stereotype of a befuddled old man. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne is somewhere between good and mediocre, seeming to force weird expressions onto his face like he just read the character description in the script for the first time. Bob Gunton as Warden Norton is over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional, but it works because Bible-thumpers are often over-the-top and seemingly one-dimensional. He's actually believable and interesting to watch. The prison guard Hadley (Clancy Brown) is realistically sadistic, but his type of comically crude sexual language sounds too contemporary for the time. The final scene is just so unrealistically over-the-top happy and sunny it's an insult to the viewer's intelligence and, I think, ruins much of the film. This film obviously has developed a huge following over the years, but I think that's largely just because of it's sentiment of hopefulness and positivity, and that doesn't necessarily indicate a well-written, well-executed, well-acted film. Some of the worst crap in theatres and on television has a hopeful, inspiring, uplifting message. Of course a film doesn't have to depict a realistic world. In fact, I like surrealism in movies. But it should at least show an interesting version of a world, and to keep any intelligent viewer's attention the characters have to be fully realized, seemingly existing in a world outside of the film's plot.	2
 Gripping and uplifting		
 no way!	It deserve 8-9 stars in my opinion, but no way this better than godfather, no way this deserve to be the top movie ever made in history	1

 Entertaining Prison Movie Isn't Nearly as Good as Its Rabid Fan Base Would Lead You to Believe		7
 Flawed but good.	"I did not see a ""goof"" submission area, so I feel compelled to comment on this movie's fatal flaws.Andy's cell was consistently laid out even right up to the night of his escape as he sat on his bed staring at the Rachel Welch poster. There in lies the flaw. If Andy crawled through his snug tunnel as depicted, with his clothes in tow, how did he get that poster to lay so flat to where it even appeared to be glued to the wall? It was so flat that even the Warden's commotion (rock throwing) in an open-air cell never moved that poster once. Given that, what about the sanitation pipe area that was equally open and subject to drafts and air movements, which would have easily moved the poster. Nailing, tacking, Velcro, and taping are out too. Even if he had tried to exit feet first he would have had to move some furniture, given the height of the tunnel's access off the ground. The guard found nothing unusual in the cell, as if Andy had vanished into thin air!The sanitary pipe leaves a lot to be desired as well. A thick-walled pipe of that diameter would need to be saw-cut in two places and have the section removed in order to allow enough room for Andy's body to fit. Armed with only a rock it would have taken Andy another year to get through the pipe. The director would have been better off installing a manhole access.Last but not least, the wool suit Andy wears in the bank looks spectacular for being crumpled up in a plastic bag only hours before the bank opened. Given the location of his rain soaked prison clothes and the time of day after a 500 yard crawl, Andy would have hastily changed in the rain and that suit would have been ruined. Unless he was packing a London Fog topcoat with him he would have had to make a visit to a dry cleaner and had a two-day wait on his clothes at best. I wish he would pack for me on my trips!""Redemption"" is a good movie, but not a great one."	5
 Why can't I put 0??	This movie is terrible from the awful performance from Morgan freeman to the lazily put together story it was hard to sit through this. The dialogue was trash and the movie looked bland and boring. The poster is the main reason the movie sucks tho because I don't like how like how the poster looks	8
" One of the Worst ""Films"" Ever Made!"		1
 I really liked this film but...		1
 Most overrated film ever.	When i first saw this I came away thinking it was an entertaining piece of movie making but nothing particularly special. I simply cannot understand why it features so highly in many top movie listings. Yes the story is good and has a nice happy ending. Andy is a character who is easy to identify with against the nefarious, sadistic warden. This unchallenging hackneyed dichotomy is helped by Andy's buddies vs the nasty gang who's leader is intent on a slightly different kind of relationship with Andy.The actors all shine and it's well photographed but is simply nothing special, it certainly doesn't warrant it's apparent stellar position in film history. I think it is the most overrated film of all time, no question. It isn't even a standout in it's own genre and is way way too long in it's telling of a tale that is unoriginal and intellectually undemanding .	5
 #2!!!!!!!!!!!!!	the all-time #2 is WAY high for this flick. NO great acting performances(they're OK but not a miracle!!!!) the story lacks logic in parts and the final sequence is a little too much. very good movie to watch a must see anytime but NOT all-time #2	5
 Boring	The movie is about an accountant who is accused of murdering his wife and her lover and as a result is sentenced for a life in prison. The movie is filled with deep meanings but unfortunately it is very boring and directed in a very lame way. Plus the musical score is preety bad and does not spark any emotions from you. In this type of movie an emotional and memorable musical score is very important but somehow the filmmakers did not seem to care.	1
 'Stir Crazy' did it better.	This movie was inspired by the brilliant Stir Crazy starring Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. As an essay on prison life, Shawshank Redemption fails on every level that Stir Crazy managed to succeed on.Shawshank is nowhere near as funny as Stir Crazy. There is not a woodpecker suited bank robbery to be found. There is no Grossberger, no homosexual black man hassling the heroes, no silly mania scenes. There is nothing here that even remotely comes close to emulating its predecessor.The obvious links to the original are still there: Morgan Freeman in the Richard Pryor role and Tim Robbins as Gene Wilder. However, Robbins and Freeman are nowhere near Wilder and Pryor in the acting stakes and we end up feeling disappointed at their lack of conviction (no pun intended) in the roles.	1
 really bad	i cannot believe someone would call this movie great i would give it a 3 but the fact it is the highest rating movie ever on this site makes me go crazy how pathetic can this be this is the most overrated movie ever created made with a low budget it seems all that happens is a guy that went to prison gets raped several times escapes and meets his friend from prison back when he was out ending 99% of the movie was made in prison where all that happened was he gets raped and washes some clothes seriously how can you even compare this near to godfather dark knight etc? ...and the bad director just killed himself at the end his wife gets killed he isn't even sad about it 20 years in prison has some money not that much and is happy how nice	1
 about it		10
 a river of feces	i pretty much hated this movie. its a prison movie, so plot is basically Tim robins gets framed than raped and eventually escapes. Morgan freeman is locked up and i don't know he just acts like a kid in this. i understand he's suppose to be locked up since he was a teen but really he's giving the same performance here as his role as god in Bruce almighty. even though he's miscast he honestly carries the movie, mainly because Tim robins does nothing in this movie. some other subplots include Tim teaching some idiot to read or something, some old guy hangs himself, they deck a roof,freeman sneaks in a hammer and robins makes chess pieces, i'll stop the the point i'm making is this movie is excruciatingly boring. number one on IMDb, are you kidding me? even from a technical standpoint this movie blows. everything is just dull and unimpressive, hell it looks more like a TV movie than a film. i'd describe the tone of this as Disney's take on jail movies. it's to concerned with being safe and classy to accurately represent prison life. everyone's favorite part of this is the ending, and that sucked too. Tim robins apparently escapes prison with a rock hammer, after digging through his cell wall for like twenty years. his hiding place is a poster? really? to make matters more hilarious he has crawls through a tunnel of poop and emerges from a poop lake in a failed attempt to move the audience. Morgan freeman gets paroled by basically insulting the judges, than he goes to a rock in some random place that Tim told him to visit, and than goes to Mexico and finds Tim on a boat. reunited and roll credits, oh yeah Morgan freeman also married his step- granddaughter. that's the dumbest ending ever written. there's so much better stuff you could be watching instead of shawshank like porn or riki-oh.	1
 Dangerous Simplicity		2
 The Prison Of Storytelling		3
 Get real everyone	I wait for the day when this film is no longer in the top 200 of IMDb, as it deserves.  Please, if any film was passed over in favor of Gump at the 1995 Oscars--it was the best film of the nineties--PULP FICTION.	5
 One of the Best Ever	"Is there anyone who does not like this film?  If there is, I've never met them.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film that doesn't sound too interesting when you first hear about it.  A banker who protests his innocence after his wife and her lover are killed befriends a group of prisoners and changes everyone's life for the better.  It does not sound that great to most people, but when you see this film you will honestly come away loving every frame of it.  Tim Robbins is great, Morgan Freeman is greater, and the supporting cast are all perfect.  William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, and Gil Bellows stand out as well.  James Whitmore, who has been in acting since the 1940s, gives his best performance as Brooks and should have at least received an Oscar nod.  If you haven't seen this film go and see it.  I can't think of any movie I'd rather watch on a rainy afternoon, or at anytime for that matter.  Frank Darabont, who had been involved in horror films before this, became a big-time name after this film.  Unfortunately, ""The Green Mile"" is nowhere close to comparing to this film which will be remembered forever.  A great achievement.  5 stars out of 5."	
 The most over-rated movie in history	Sorry, but I don't get it. Below average movie. Why it gets all this praise is beyond me. Shouldn't even be in the top 100, let alone No. 1. Its not even the best Stephen King movie, I mean when you look at the likes of The Shining, Misery etc. There is no comparison. Don't believe the hype (you'll be disappointed)	1
 Good but not perfect	Good but not perfectGood but not perfectGood but not perfect	7
 It is so nice	It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.	5
 shawshank redemption? more like shawshank decompression	This movie was incredibly unrealistic, I hate how the father lied to his son. it was ridiculous and the son was stupid for believing him. the fact that the father turns into a fish at the end is highly problematic. 2/10	2
 hello	I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.	9
 142 Min	Frank Darabont's writing and direction are generally crisp, but Shawshank is a tough watch and audiences could use some time cut from its 142 minutes.	7
 Outstanding movie!	This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.	7
 Quite good	Quite good but nowhere near as good as scooby doo 2 monsters unleashed	8
 Mind-blowing	Absolutely mind-blowing movie. Great script, direction and acting!	10
 Best Movie	Truly deserves the top rated movie.Definitely Must watch	10
 Get busy living or get busy dying!	I really recommend this MP. I thank all the casting, directors, producers, writers and other staff for crafting this unforgettable movie.I give 10/10 for leaving a smile on my face at the end and joy in my heart.Thank you!	10
 One of my top five for sure	Best movie I have ever seen as single part movie, although it is considered as an old movie filming and editing was acceptable.	
 Reading	Cool to look at.the action is out of this world!I want to see it over and over.	8
 amazing movie	Well directed & written. Each character is well played!	
 perfect!	Everything about the movie is perfect. its one of the movie that you have to see in your life.	10
 Good movie	Good movie best movie GoodGood verry good movie good movie good movie	10
 Inspiring and moving	One of the best films of all time. A source of inspiration and emotion. A reminder that no matter how dire life is, hope always survives.	10
 The movie that deserves to be on the 1st place.	Shawshank Redemption is a film which follows the events of Andy Dufresne while he has to live, or more like, survive, at Shawshank Prison.This film has it all. The scenes, the camera angles, the actors, the dialogue, story... It's all tied in in a way that few films do. The movie continues its narrative perfectly, and the actors do an amazing job at portraying the characters.I don't want to do a review with spoilers, but I'll tell you, if you're having doubts on watching this movie, don't.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	The most important thing about this movie is hope. Hope for those who have no hope. Hope for a new life and get rid of the hardships. Hope for create tunnels in the hardships and get rid of them. This movie gave me a lot of hope:)	9
 Just perfect	1994 - year for the classics. The best movie ever.	10
 Not fair to rate this movie !	Simply a masterpiece, i was a fan of Morgan Freeman since long years, but watching The Shawshank is something different, stories, life, prison, concipracy, words said never forgotten...For me, my best complete movie ever with stunning narration and end.. What to say ?All what you need is here..	10
 No words	I actually don´t have any words to describe it. It is just mind blowing, awesome ...	10
 Wonderful	"Amazing,Mindblowing !I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already. I remembered what she said, so I watched it. I have watched it many many times since then and it gets better with every showing."	10
 amazing film	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite	10
 awesome movie	Awesome movie so much lessons for a single movieam just adding word to submit the review	10
 Brilliant	I watched it a few years ago and i dont really remember the story in details, but i remember that i had i lot of emotions here and this movie give you some life lessons.Morgan Freeman is genius!	9
 Movie nice	This is the best movie I have ever seen, watching again and again many times but still feeling intact, thank you author!	10
 Its my favorite	This movie is greatIta my forever movie .. I will watch it always	10
 Awesome movie!	Awesome movie! A small preview of what life means behind of prison accusing you for something that never done by you.	10
 All Time Master Piece - Motivating Film Forever !	One of the most loveable, likeable, adorable movies, which has recall value forever. it leaves a positive impact on the viewer. I was moved by this simple movie which depicts hope, friendship and redemption,	10
 Just Amazing	The movie is really but the 1st half is too slow, the movie is not meant for those who like adventurous movie.	10
 eh	Its was okay i suppose! not really something im personally into	5
 my notes	Well made movie with a great story. very long and dragged at times (2 viewings)	6
 not much amazing	Not too goodtoo boring movie,i have one spoiler but im not give you	6
 Very touching movie	Love this movie. Good for people to know about history.	10
 Best Movie I have ever seen	Wow Its the best criminal prison drama movie I have ever seen	10
 One of the best movies I have ever seen!	I watched this movie just to pass out some good time... and you know what.. i had sore and wet eyes at the end.. i don't know why but the movie's end, couldn't stop myself..	10
 A Masterpiece	The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont in 1994 is the masterpiece of all masterpieces.	10
 Epic	This is the best of all time...There can be no better person for the role of Morgan Freeman and the storyline is just the best...	10
 No words	I cant describe how amazing this movie is, but i dont have to because almost everyone saw it and if you havent... what are you waiting for? Probably the best movie on earth	10
 A Movie About Time	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 A beautiful movie	This movie is an ode about perseverance and hope.I recommend this movie for every people	10
 Bland	Ok sue me for being different but I'm not sure how this slow paced film rose to the top of the IMDb scoreboard.	6
 I just can't forgive these prisoners for what they did	I know it's trying to metaphor some stuff in the movie. But prisoners w/ life sentence? Excuse me? Anyone remember what they had done? THE OUGHT TO SUFFER FOR THEIR CRIME!!!!!!! (Except for Andy cuz he's innocent)	3
 realy deserves 1st	The best movie I saw until 2018.I think the likelihood of making a movie like this is very small.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	A thief, who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology, is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO.	10
 My favorite movie	This is my go to favorite movie of all time, there's comedy, drama and suspense. I've seen a lot of movies over the years but even as time goes on its a movie that never gets old. The characters are all believable and you feel for them in parts. When it gets to the end I always wish that it went on a bit longer but the ending is fitting with the story.	9
 Not as good as the 'Family Guy' parody...	"I don't recall the first time, or subsequent times I have seen this movie, but doing my rankings, my memory of it gave it a 4/10 (3 stars- means I may watch it again, but I don't really want to, 4 stars- I will watch it again, with no plans to, 5 stars- ordinary, will neither discourage or actively encourage people to watch...).I watched it again last night because of it's IMDb ranking to see if the world is right, and I am an a contrary prick... the answer- the world is wrong.Basically this movie has been reviewed too many times by sentimental @$$holes who are too much in love with the richness and satisfaction of Morgan Freemans voice and the lulling of a placid soundtrack.It has some great stars, Clancy Brown is unbelievable, menacing and awesome. Probably one of the only people you can have speak in a Morgan Freeman movie and think- ""What a great voice!"" Robbins, I found to be a whimsical toss, his years of rape didn't make sense, if he was such a good guy, such a smart guy, why he couldn't have solved a 3 year gang rape run? Also, 'Andy' is put in the hole for almost a month and in that time, the guards didn't destroy his poster, a criminal didn't take it down or stick their d@#$ into it? His room never got tossed? The poster never got touched in the dozen years he had it up? He openly talks of his geology skill and his knowledge of cutting rock, and the guards/warden/convicts never saw a 'red flag'?This is just an overly sentimental, Vaseline around the lens 'bow of the Titanic moment' movie, with no wit, grit or heart. I guess I have seen too many realistic and quality prison shows, movies, documentary's to take this dated circle-jerk seriously, it is absolutely no 10/10.A guy spends a decade plus being gang raped, doing tax returns and legal favors for the guards that abuse and in at least one case kill the inmates? This movie is no 'Green Mile' and 'Green Mile' isn't as good as a single episode of 'HBO's- OZ'!I give it an extra star, raising it up to- 5/10, because there is nothing bad about it, and I wouldn't discourage someone from watching it. But don't ask me to score this soft and mushy pointless 'love story', that is too chicken to actually 'show' the love scenes between the two main characters a 10/10 when it's not even as good as the 'Family Guy' parody..."	5
 A life-changing movie	"There are a lot of good movies, and then there are movies that have the power to change your life. The Shawshank Redemption is just an extraordinarily inspirational movie. It just isn't a normal prison break story; a very deep implicit definition is buried in every scene of it. The main theme is the presence and the belief in hope by the main character of the story, Andy Dufresne. Repeatedly saying ""hope is a good thing"", Andy finally gets what he always wanted: an escape and a new start in the Pacific, something that was always described as impossible by the other prisoners. I guess that the element that triggered the viewers' attention the most was the optimism and mysterious character of Andy Dufresne. Watching the movie, we weren't really able to read what was going on his mind even though we had implicit clues of the clever and beautiful things he kept to himself. The choice of Tim Robbins as the main persona was well thought by Frank Darabont as he doesn't show a lot of emotions on his face. The bond that connected the inmates, especially Red and Andy was very strong, leading to sacrifices and promises. The friendship between the two men lasts beyond the walls of Shawshank and finds itself reincarnated in Zihuatanejo, the country with no memory. Another thing that strikes the spectators is the enjoyment and the love of the small things in life. This concept was seen in the ""opera music scene"", where the beauty of the music and the voices of the Italian ladies went past the skins and through the souls of the prisoners. The excitement felt by all these men was the only pleasing element that wasn't taken from them in this dangerous place. The most important piece of The Shawshank Redemption was the message that inspired all the movie lovers: every man has value and importance in the world. This message personally helped me slide away from my negative attitude and helped me enjoy every moment of life. For this incredible adaptation of ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King, I would like to gratefully thank Frank Darabont sharing his work of art to the world."	10
 Not That Great		3
 The ideal movie	This is the movie you wanna watch if you're sad, happy, angry, or confused. This movie will suck you into it's world, and leave you mindblowed with various feelings. This movie is among the finest films ever made.Hopefully you too will get this sensation of watching this masterpiece. Freeman shows what great talent he has, though it is truly Robbins who gives the movie its soul and heart. I remember tghinking of this movie several days after watching it. it came up when i had to make choices. The dilemmas of the movie can easily be related to your own lives. Masterpiece. Excellence. Love. Peace.	10
 My First Review. SPOILER ALERT	"SPOILER AHEAD, DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARNED. Andy Dufresne is a banker convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of his wife and her lover. The message that the movie tries to pass is that hope can set you free. It talks about Andy and his friends that lives in jail for a long time, and how Andy became ""successful"" even at jail. Andy knows that his place isn't in there, he dosn't consider himself guilty for the murder of his wife and her lover, he don't even tries to defend himself in the court, so when he's in jail he seems to be so peaceful and tranquilized that the other prisoners thinks he's spoiled, and he suffers from that from time to time because some queers liked him and frequently spanked and raped him. Andy also became friend with the director of the jail and the guard, using his banker skills to help them, but in return he asks for his friends to be treated nicely. Andy has a lot of hobbies, he's affectionate for stones, and he likes to play chess to, but he favorite hobby was dropping rests of what he toked of his wall inside his cell, he toked 20 years to make the entire tunnel and scape, of course he wouldn't leave his friend Red, behind with nothing, he told what the future reserved for them and told him where to look for it. For me the high level of the movie was at the end when they reveal Andy's plan, but it's so complex that I think that you would rather just go and watch the movie. One of my favorite movies of all time."	10
 A nice movie, but maybe a bit overrated.	I just saw the movie today. I liked the plot of the movie, and it didn't feel like it lasted for 2,5 hours. During the film, you start to love the prisoners, because you get to know them more and more.I think this isn't the GREATEST movie ever, but it sure as hell is a good movie. I'd rate it a 8 or an 8,5.I like the fact too they show you how the prisoners react when their prison time is over. I find it hard to imagine how i'd feel if i was locked for 50 years. And a happy ending always makes me feel allot better.. although it is a bit dull.	8
 it's good but way overrated	I've been thinking why is this movie The best movie for so many people, then I remembered it is like music, the best music is the ones you heard at 14. because you associate with memory and when your brain starts developing and your awareness of yourself and others come into being.this movie revitalized my love for classical and baroque music no doubt and introduced some themes. I find the main character somewhat unrealistic only because I personally cannot relate to him. If I was in his position I doubt I would have done what he did.It is good but I prefer Morgan Freeman's The Bucket List much more and a variety of prison movies(American History X) and TV series(Prison Break).	6
 A Fantastic film. But definitely not #1		9
 A Great Story		9
 Why is this the best movie ever for everyone?	Want to know why this movie is the best ever made? Is simple really, because it talks about all of us. It tells the story of how we all feel in times of desperate. The basic needs of all of us, for this movie its freedom, revenge, and love(friendship)! That is our emotional NEED in today world. Therefor I think that if anyone wants to make a another great movie they should remember to make the film out of a simple element, Human Emotional Needs, and let the lack of those needs drive the film, until those needs are achieved at the end of the film. That's what will make a great film. However it is our creativity that would make the film comes alive and stick in the viewers mind forever.	10
 The best film i've ever seen	A film like this comes along every few decades. Its better than savage or amazing the only way to describe it is the greatest film EVER. Its all about a man called Andy Dufresne falsely accused of murder of his wife and her lover and is sent to shawshank prison where he is beaten by the guards and other prisoners. Eventually he makes a friend called Red and fits in with Red. Andy was a smart banker before prison and used his brains to help the other prisoners like solving the guards tax problems then the wardens. Andy finds a way to escape from the prison by digging a hole and using a poster of Rita Hayworth to cover the hole(That is why the short story is called Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption) Andy escapes but before escaping he told Red to look under a tree when he leaves. Red leaves and finds that Andy under a fake name living in Mexico. The two meet for the first time in years and shake hands. The Shawshank Redemption starts and ends Fascinating.	10
 best movie ever made!!		10
 Best film ever made?	"One of my favourite films ever. I first saw the movie shortly after it came out, I was around 16 years old. I like to revisit it every year or so and it's still as fresh as ever. Although there are some unpleasant realities and strong language, for once I think they are justified and not overly emphasised.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are superb. You would think a film set mostly in a prison would be depressing, boring even. Not so. I always feel uplifted after watching it and the final scene never fails to bring a tear to my eye. I like it so much I bought two copies on DVD in case I lose one. This should be on everyone's ""must see"" list."	10
 Brilliant!!!!!!!!	Thought to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ranked 2nd on IMDb's list of top 250 movies ever created. When i first heard of this film and its general plot i wasn't too enthusiastic about watching it. I mean, lets get serious... yet another prison movie where someone is supposedly wrongly accused for a crime he did not commit... we've seen them all. However, i can honestly and proudly admit that i was beyond the shadow of a doubt, completely and utterly wrong. This is truly an amazing movie. With its own charisma to it, it leaves the audience on the edge of their seats, wanting to find out more and waiting for the plot to unravel further. It captures your mind and truly speaks to you. Of course, a great deal of respect must be given to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robin for their outstanding performances. This movie deserves to have its own genre. A MUST see movie and a personal favorite.	9
 Assured storytelling at its finest	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the finest examples of Stephen King's work adapted to the big screen. If not THE finest. Based on a short story from King's novella Different Seasons, it may be that rare thing where its a film that actually improves upon its source material. The story, of a man wrongfully imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover made for an interesting read, but it made for an even better film.Although TSR was nominated for seven Academy Awards, it didn't win a single one. Most of them went to the completely overrated Forrest Gump, including Best Picture and Best Actor. I think that was one of the Academy's darkest days.Despite the fact TSR did next to no business in 1994, it quickly gathered word of mouth afterwards, and went on to a healthy afterlife on video and TV. But that's not all. It slowly worked its way into the hearts and minds of people the world over, and today it's regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Even a true American classic. And its even No 2 on the IMDb top 250. Beating out Forrest Gump by a significant margin!TSR is also one of the few films in the world that actually deserves all the acclaim it receives. I really loved this movie. I loved everything about it. The theme of maintaining hope in the face of crushing despair could have made for Hallmark TV movie material, but in the hands of first time director Frank Darabont, he's created an utter masterpiece.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, the man who allegedly did the crime. He is convicted and ordered to serve two consecutive life sentences in Shawshank State Prison. Robbins' performance is interesting if you've seen the one other really good film he made in 1994, The Hudsucker Proxy. There he played a bumbling, doltish fool. His work in TSR is a jarring about face.He completely downplays his emotions to the point of resigned dourness. Its quite a shocking thing to watch. But as good as Robbins' performance is, what makes it that all the more special is Andy's character is opened up not by him, but by an external character.Morgan Freeman, in arguably the best performance of his career plays Red, the prison fixer. He can get things for any inmate. Whether it be cigarettes, or a rock hammer. He is the narrator of the picture, and it is through his words that the world of Shawshank becomes a harsh and frightening reality.He knows the ins and outs of the prison system. When new inmates arrive, he can usually tell which ones won't last. He knows your first night at Shawshank is the worst. New inmates have to endure the catcalls and taunts of their cellmates. Red pegged Andy as the one who would break first. But he never did.Red freely admits he didn't think much of Andy at first. But slowly, the two men become acquaintances, and much later, friends. Morgan Freeman's resigned, soothing voice illuminates the harsh surroundings of the prison walls. The scariest thing about the prison was the Sisters. Sadistic prisoners who turned gay while locked up, and try to convert others. First through suggestion. And if that fails, force. Andy was their favourite target. And he had to endure rapes and beatings for his first two hellish years at Shawshank.Andy's background as an investment banker brings him to the attention of Warden Norton. Norton is a hypocritical tyrant. He claims to be a devout Christian, but he won't tolerate any challenges to his authority. Any who do wind up in solitary. For months at a time if necessary. Norton has Andy secure funds he has embezzled. And in exchange, Andy can procure funds for a new library and even beers for his fellow inmates. As long as he does exactly what Norton tells him to.The Shawshank Redemption resonates on many different levels as it tells many different stories. One of the most poignant is the plight of Brooks, an elderly inmate. Imprisoned for years, when he finally makes parole, he is terrified. Life at Shawshank has become the only life he's ever known. Once released, he knows he'll never survive out there. And he's right. The world has gone and changed on him. And life as a grocery bagger is no life at all. So he hangs himself. Its a haunting story. And one that never fails to choke me up inside.That situation extends to Red too. In Shawshank, he has a purpose. He is respected, valued, needed. Parole is not much different than a death sentence. He gets rejected for parole frequently over the course of 30 years. And he couldn't be happier.The most wrenching thing of all is Andy's apparent deterioration. He believes in hope. And tries to inspire some in his cellmates when he plays Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro over the PA system. That scene is a joyful moment to behold, with the men in the yard transfixed by the music. And Norton punishes him for his defiance. Andy seems to reach breaking-point when he confesses to Red he might as well have murdered his wife, because he didn't show her enough love and affection.It seems Norton has finally broken Andy. But when Andy escapes, its a triumphal moment. That famous scene, after Andy crawls 500 yds through a sewage pipe, standing in a downpour, relishing his first taste of freedom. It will send your spirits sky-high.Things end appropriately with Andy and later Red gaining freedom, on a secluded island. I love the way the camera observes their reunion from a distance. After their souls have been laid to bear, they deserve some privacy. One of the defining pictures of our generation. An experience I love to re-visit over and over.Magnificent!	10
 Excellent film	The Shawshank Redemption is a gripping masterpiece that should not be missed by anyone. Andy Dufrense keeps us in suspense the entire way with his mysterious attitude to prison life and his claim that he is innocent. Tim Robbins performs excellently. Morgan Freemans role as Red telling the story was also quite an interesting touch. When I hired this film my expectations were not that it would become one of my favorite movies of all time. Guys definitely this is something you have to see for yourself and you will be categorically satisfied. Many unexpected twists and turns and actually quite plausible considering the time it's set in. I found myself on the edge of my seat almost the entire way. There are many touching and feel good scenes also particularly when Andy and his friends share a few beers in the sun on the roof after dealing his superior and for a few moments feel like free men. Fantastic film check it out if you haven't seen it re-watch if you have. 5 stars.	9
 Best there is, seriously...		10
 Make sure that an innocent person is never harassed anywhere, anytime !!	Frank Darabont has created a good film about the misuse of criminal justice system and the obnoxious corruption in prisons.He has done this by showing an insider's view of a penitentiary from the perspective of its inmates.Although Tim Robbins has a good role in this film as Andy,he is surpassed by Red played by Morgan Freeman.He is at the summit of his acting prowess as everything is written on his face.There is no other actor in Hollywood or elsewhere who could have done this role of Red with absolute conviction as Morgan Freeman. Shawshank Redeption tells us in clear terms that in prisons it is the rule of everyman for himself but sometimes there are exceptions. Feelings of suffering,sadness,trust,joy,companionship occur which give the prisoners the hope to carry on.It is nice that there is not much focus on feminine characters as they did not have anything that could have justified their presence.	7
 Good not great	Shawshank Redemption is entertaining and well made. It's not, however, the greatest movie of all time. It's a thoughtful film and is remarkable for appealing to people who don't usually put a whole lot of thinking into their cinema. It covers the greatest range of viewers for like-ability from the Fast and the Furious crowd to the Lost in Translation audience. I don't think it'd attract big numbers from the cinema nerds of Eraserhead fandom though. That's not to say that Lynch fans should have a more weighted vote on IMDb. It's just that if you're into your cinema and you watch a lot of good films, from obscure to popular, then being told Shawshank Redemption is the best film of all time is like hearing someone say Radiohead is the best band ever. Yes, they're very good but you suspect their cheerleaders are only comparing them to Coldplay, U2 and REM.	7
 The greatest movie of all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!		
 one thing I didn't like		8
 great movie	I think this movie was very realistic and I realized that live in prison is pretty far from reality. Prison is not a joke, prison will change you against your will. Andy Durfsteen is wonderful character. He is full of surprises till the end. He has the power to change the hell into heaven. He shows us that power is not stored only in muscles but in brain too. He believes in hope. He knows that he is supposed to be in prison to the end of his life but there is still hope. He has plenty of time for escape and with hope he can get over everything. With enough time and plenty of hope you can escape through 10 meters fat wall with a spoon. Thats all whats this movie about but its not enough to know, you have to understand, you have to see it. Please excuse my English but I had to write something.	10
 Acadamy awards?		10
 Best Movie in the 20th Century!!!	The Shawshank Redempion is a great movie! It is a story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) unfairly accused of murdering his wife and her lover. He is put into one of the worst prisons in the U.S., the Shawshank prison. At the beginning in the prison his only friend is Red (Morgan Freeman). Other people judge him as a coward with no guts, mainly because he never fights, takes part in sport and always has a sad face. Late the people start liking him because the discover that he a nice creative man. After the old librarian left he became the library director. In a few years he created consisting of thousands of new and old book, and he made a special reading room for people wanting to read. By doing that he improved the behavior of some prisoners and changed the whole prison. One day Andy is gone, and no one knows where he is!	9
 A movie that is a help in times of desperation!	"This is a movie to give to the people that are in need of hope. I remember when it was in the theaters and I was one of the few people that went to see it. I returned to see the film three more times, each time bring a friends that I had preached the film to. They to were inspired to rave about the film to friends.My disappointment of the year was to see the film nominated for 7 Academy awards and not get any. I felt like Quentin Tarantino at the MTV movie awards. He said something along the lines of, ""You don't know what it is like to lose to that retard every time."" A little harsh, but to the point.The greatest justice is that ""Forrest Gump"" is fading while ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has gained a life of it's own."	10
 My god this is beautiful.		10
 Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman have real chemistry. Frank Darabont delivers solid direction.	"Frank Darabont's beautiful adaptation of Stephen King's RITA HAYWORTH AND SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is an experience to remember for life. Tim Robbins is Andy Dufresne and is sent to prison in New England for murdering his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman is Red, the man in prison who can get things for you. Together, they forge a lasting friendship as Andy's hope helps penetrate the thick walls in Shawshank prison, in more ways than one.Andy's first few years at Shawshank are filled with beatings and molestation's by a group of cretins called the ""Sisters."" The leader is a man named Bogs who gives slime balls a good name. Sometimes Andy fights them off but as Red points out, ""Prison is no fairy tale world."" Red arranges for his friends and Andy to tar the roof of the plate factory giving them all a nice rest from the prison walls. Red is definitely a man with connections. Clancy Brown is the picture of cruelty as the head of the guards named Byron Hadley. Andy overhears Hadley complaining about how the government is gonna take a nice chunk from his brother's inheritance. Andy informs Hadley how he could keep most of his brother's inheritance by allowing a tax free gift to his wife. Hadley nearly throws him off the roof but manages to hear him out. Andy sets up the papers for him in exchange for getting Red and his friends three beers a piece. To everyone's surprise Hadley agrees. This wins Andy a lot of friends especially when one offers him a beer and he tells him he's quit drinking.The warden gets wind of Andy's accounting skills and realizes he can use him to do his taxes. Andy gets a vicious beating from Bogs and the ""Sisters"" but this time Hadley beats Bogs to a pulp, crippling him and having him drinking through a straw for the rest of his life. Bogs is transferred out and the ""Sisters"" never touch Andy again.When Andy returns he finds the poster of Rita Hayworth he asked Red for. It comes with a note that says ""Free of Charge."" Red and his friends are happy Andy is back and well. The Warden, played chillingly by Bob Gunton as greed personified, transfers Andy into the library and out of the laundry where Andy worked and endured beatings the first couple of years.Andy soon becomes an assistant to Brooks, an old prisoner nicely played by James Whitmore. Brooks cares for a bird named Jake and is well liked by Red and his friends. Later, Brooks is released and finds he's institutionalized and can't make it in the real world. Sadly, he kills himself and this worries Red more than anyone because he's constantly rejected by the Parole Board and fears being institutionalized.Andy sends out many letters requiring more funding for the library, with the permission of the warden, and gets it converted into a beautiful place in memory of Brooks. There, Andy helps many prisoners get their Higschool education's.Andy helps one man in particular out, a young thief named Tommy, that Red and his friends like as well. Later, Red and Andy find out that man spent time in prison with the real man who killed Andy's wife and her lover. Andy tells the warden and the warden has Hadley shoot Tommy to death.Andy is now trapped helping the corrupt Warden with all his dirty money. He confides in Red and tells him he wants to spend the rest of his life on an island in the pacific. Red tells him not to think like that but Andy gives Red instructions to find something of his when he gets out. Red promises too but is worried about Andy. Andy says his choice is ,""Get busy living or get busy dying."" The rest you can find out for yourself in this thought provoking and perfectly acted film. This is not just some prison movie but a movie about the harsh realities of confinement, the choices we make in our life, and of having hope despite the worst circumstances.Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins have never been better as well as the supporting cast. William Sadler does a nice job as Heywood, the Hank Williams loving friend who thinks a book in the library is called THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISCO.Frank Darabont directs this film so well you truly hate for it to end. Roger Deakins Cinematography is epic and inspiring and Thomas Newman's score finds just the right mood. This film is one of those you turn on in the middle of and just watch to the end, an incredibly deep and moving experience."	10
 My favorite movie...	"I liked this film a lot!! This is the best film i ever seen! A like films about jail or something, especially when such films are long... - - - Morgan Freeman is very good actor... A lot of his films are good Of course there other good actors Also there are some funny places to watch..., but this film was brutal. People who haven't seen this film, i recommend them to watch it... The film beginning was the best in the film i think, but I liked the end too. Some horrible things happened there too, like when that ""Elvis"" man killed... and of course when old man (Brooks) died. I would like to watch this film again for many times."	10
 Simply the best	Simply stated, this may be the best movie of all time. The story is infinitely engaging, the acting is impeccable, the cinematography is marvelous, and the score is wonderful. It is probably the most well rounded film you can hope to watch. I saw it first in 1995 on video and was amazed that it did not win a single Academy award. It certainly should have. Do yourself a favor. If you really want to see a true work of cinematic art, see this movie. FOR THE NAY SAYERS: They say that if you are young and NOT liberal you don't have a heart, and that if you are old and NOT conservative, you don't have a brain. Well, no matter what age you are, if you do NOT enjoy this movie you don't have a heart or a brain!	10
 The Best Movie of the past 20 Years	This movie, which I have seen at least 15 times, is my pick for the best movie of the past 20 years and certainly among my Top 10 Films of all time. It was a wonderful story with one of the best endings I've ever experienced in a film. Morgan Freeman fully deserved his Oscar nomination but, conversely, Tim Robbins was robbed of his. His portrayal of Andy DuFresne, a convict lifer wrongfully convicted of killing his wife, was nothing short of amazing. How the academy could have overlooked him in their voting is beyond me and everyone else I know that has seen the film. This is the only film for which I have never heard a bad comment and it got rave reviews from everyone I told to see it. If you haven't seen The Shawshank Redemption, you've missed one of the most wonderful and powerful films of all time. See it today! You'll thank me.	10
 Thank you all	Finally! For the second time in a week this movie is back to No. 2 where it is rightly placed, second to the Godfather. Thanks to everybody who voted to bring it back. I just wish it will stay there. It was very awful seeing this movie ranked behind just one of LOR films. What is even worse is that the only movie that collected more votes than Shawshank Redemption is LOR1. I hope that will not be the case one day. If it is the Godfather, we would 've lived with it, but some times it is difficult to understand these IMDb users' votes.I wont add any other comments to what people already mentioned. I just want to say that if you haven't yet seen this movie, then you don't know what you are missing.10/10	10
 This movie was great!!	"This story has such an awesome effect on those who watch it! This movie leaves you reading the credits with that ""feel good"" feeling deep inside you. Timm Robins and Morgan Freeman absolutely steal the show with their amazing friendship. I give this movie five stars, two thumbs up, and one heck of a high-five!!This movie proves that you do not need to pump a movie full of action scenes, romance, and comedy in order to wind up with a great film in the end. This movie is by far one of the greatest films that i have seen in a long time and i was excited to find out that i would be able to voice my opinion with leaving a comment like this!"	10
 one of my top ten		10
 This movie is touching	"***Contains Spoilers*** This movie is a touching quite film about one man's quest for dignity in a dehumanizing prison system and his finding freedom. This movie has two baffo performances by Morgan Freeman as Red ""the man who can get things"" Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrense the quiet banker who escapes the soul crushing hell on earth that is Shawshank prison my first thoughts when i saw this was ""this is based on a Stephen King book?? huh this is really deep and emotional"" so needless to say it comes of as something you wouldn't expect IL King to write but the movie is a great touching look at the indomitable human spirit and friendship it is a very good movie."	10
 Atonement for Being Ignored in the Beginning *Spoilers*	This shouldn't be #3. In fact, it should be #1. I believe the writing behind a film is the most important aspect of it. This movie tells a story of a man who was left to die for something he never did, and how he takes what is given to him, and creates a intellectual paradise for himself and fellow inmates. Being such a genius, he is able to cover all his bases knowing that all of it could come crashing down, and it did. He makes a thought impossible escape, exposes his biggest enemy for what he is, and takes all his money which rightfully belongs to him anyway. It is a genius script and both actors are in my top 10. I love this movie, and it's second to none as it takes the most important aspects of film-making and owns all other movies at them. (Although props to Charlie Kaufman for being the coolest writer ever, but still not making my #1 movie)	9
" Greatest ""prison/escape"" movie ever"	"The best I've seen so far in my life. I have missed it when it came out and actually I only saw it last week. It was a rerun on TV way after midnight. I went to bed a 4 o'clock in the morning and next day bought the DVD. It absolutely great and 9.0 it's way too small a mark for this one :) The main idea is about an extremely smart guy who knows how to keep its mouth shut :) ... but I guess there were others that commented the plot earlier so I can't bring new stuff to it :) If you missed this movie then go and rent it, buy it do whatever's necessary to see it because it's 100% worth. The plot is great, the characters are exquisitely built and you won't be able to guess what happens. Tim Robins makes the role of his life in my opinion, and Morgan Freeman is also great.Just to compare I have recently saw ""Escape From Alcatraz"", which by the way was aired in prime time , and it's not even close to this one.Final advice: YOU MUST SEE IT."	10
 'Shawshank', masterpieces, are about people	"'The Shawshank Redemption' may be hard to convince somebody to watch, but it's important to make sure everyone does. A prison movie is not the way it should be classified because 'The Shawshank Redemption' is a story about people. It is told through a prison and the idea that would be a cliché in any other film, hope. So, hope no longer becomes a cliché because it is realistic in Shawshank. Thus, people and their motives and environments make films interesting, realistic, influential, and memorable. And because Frank Darabont found a way to get all of these elements into the greatest film ever made, people who see 'The Shawshank Redemption' look at life at a whole new perspective. That being to ""Get busy living, or get busy dying"", and to always have hope."	10
 Cinematic Perfection		10
 Character forming		10
 One of the True Instant Classics	I don't care what anybody says about this movie, it is simply great. I watched it for the first time, on a bootleg screener copy, back in early 1995. I used to get the Academy screeners, and I'd be so excited that I was getting movies that were still in theaters, that I'd watch some I normally wouldn't. Shawshank was one of those. Not the type of movie I would rush to see, but my family had watched it, so I gave it a shot. I fell in love with this movie after the very first viewing. It's one of those rare movies that seems to get better, each and every time you watch it. When I see it on TV, which is quite often, I find that it's hard to turn the channel. It's such a human movie. Just about everyone can relate to something in this film. If you can't appreciate a film like this, I truly feel sorry for you. This is what film-making is all about.	10
 one of the best movies you'll ever see, with everything you'll ask for in a movie		10
 I get something from Shaw shank Redemption		
 Hope is a good thing		
 Hope, Despair, Assimilation and Rejection	Spoiler!! The philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the finest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and despair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the philosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to consider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so poignantly delivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his nightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation into the culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging to an inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in assimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole rejections have become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting out of prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly views Shawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses concern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when Red proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood. Red, in essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope and rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to sell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether Andy has reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really matter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it is the manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in Red's parole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the same despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier. Only when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton is Red presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and rejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly from Red's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on his impulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside the greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's philosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.In doing so, he provides a happy ending to a film that may live on forever due to the criticality of its subject matter and its masteful delivery of its message.	10
 Incredible film!		10
 A wonderfully constructed, emotional masterpiece		
 Unforgettable		10
 Flat...	"For a movie about a subject as broad and powerful as prison, this movie felt decidedly flat;  there were ""bad"" guys and ""good"" guys and no-one in between.  It follows a familiar trajectory and in my opinion, does not achieve anythign new on the cinematic or storytelling front.  The sotry itself?  Well, its simple feel-good melodrama.  As hard as this might be to imagine, life in the prison is idealized.  It's a stereotypical American story of righteous triumph that does little to stir emotions or provoke thought."	
 It's No. 2(000) on my list		
 A well deserved second place	Many people ask the fatidic question: why does this movie is ranked second best movie of all time???  But I believe that most of them have miss the point: we don't love movie because its `cool' or because one is more `intellectual' or anything else; no, we love movie when they leave to us a powerful message. So yes, this movie is quit simple, the plot is basic, the actors are ok, but not exceptional but the image that stay in your mind at the end is a message of hope, it shows you that sometimes, in our life, our beliefs are more important than anything else; that we must choose the deepest way to succeed in what we expect to shine, because hope is the last thing to die.10/10	10
 Awesome Movie	I finally saw this movie.  I wanted to rent it after seeing this is the number two favorite movie of all time.  But I could never find it in the video store or library.  Of all places, I finally saw it on television! In the age of predictable plots, I could not predict this movie at all until the very last few seconds it reveals the events.  We watch movies for the truth and there are lots in this one.  There are some valuable lessons here: never lose hope, always do your best wherever you go, persistence, persistence.	10
 the most overrated movie in history	as i was saying in the title this is way overrated...i can't believe they called it a psychological movie, and i think it's a copy of all escape movies in history. i mean yes, the acting is good, it has some good lines, but nothing more...it is a very normal good movie...just that	8
 Wonderful		8
 1 of greatest films of all time!	Shawshank really surprised me. I didn't think any prison movie could shape up to Escape from Alcatraz but this one did! Tim Robbins gives a brilliant performance and the supporting cast shows no flaws. The ending will leave you begging for more. I recommend for everyone to see this great film.	10
 Nicely done but too in love with the camera	"I gave this film a 7 over all. I think it was very well filmed and acted, but perhaps that's my problem with it - there's the 'feeling' that you're watching something 'significant' but the aura it seems to generate seems out of line with the proportion and events of the story. But, then that's the magic of cinema, and it _did_ pull the wool over people's eyes (therefore the 9's and 10's in the poll).I was especially impressed as I'm not a King fan (either on paper or any film/miniseries adaptations i've seen) and wasn't expecting much from this, but the narrative and characterisation are fairly strong (again, if out if sync with the film's ""feel"")"	7
 Well done, but unoriginal	"Though I really enjoyed this movie, never would I agree that it is best film ever.  It's powerful and full of heart, but it lacks one thing which is extremely important in a good film: originality.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were excellent in this film but their relationship is much like the relationship between Clint Eastwood and the librarian in ""Escape From Alcatraz.""  The involvement of the library, the old coon who dies (Doc), the brut who is a threat (Wolf), the hole, the oppressive warden, and the escape in general all come from ""Escape From Alcatraz.""  Though ""Escape From Alcatraz"" is not as powerful and emotional as ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" it is a brilliantly done film and has the originality which ""Shawshank"" lacks. Though I do not want to belittle those who worship ""Shawshank,"" I would suggest that anyone who has seen it should rent ""Escape From Alcatraz."" Then you may think twice before calling ""Shawshank"" the greatest film ever."	7
 The greatest movie, especially the storyline (ending)	"This is simply the best movie I have ever come across. It makes you ""stick with the movie"" from the beginning to the very last end. Especially the ending is great, but also the build up to it, the great acting of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.Definitely a must-see for everyone !!"	10
 One of the best ever	This film is quite simply fantastic, great performances, great storyline, well directed and produced, my favourite film ever.	10
 Overrated, and poignant infirmary drama is too long, but has a satisfying value.		7
 Brilliant, brilliant film	This has to be one of the best, if not the best, movie I have ever seen. Combining the masterful acting skills of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, Frank Darabont blends empathy with brutal physical and emotional violence to the best possible effects. The chemistry between Robbins and Freeman is wonderful, whilst clinical, precise and realistic writing from Stephen King ensures that this is one of the most worthy candidates for Movie of the Decade. If you only ever see one movie for the next 10 years, see this one.	10
 Perfect movie	I am happy to know that I am not the only one who thinks this is one of the best movies of all time. It's my personal favorite. It shows the determination of a person to live his life. How he works for years on his escape tunnel. The subplot of the parallel life outside of prison of Brooks and Freeman's character is excellent. I don't think any part of the movie is bad, not even avarage. It's perfect from beginning to end. The only probable flaw I see in it is that it makes criminals look better than they actually are, but that's the point.	10
 A very thought provoking cerebral movie .........	It is a great movie .... a movie that opens up a new dimension every time one sees it . It has a message for you everytime you see it.One can say it is a movie about hope against all odds . It is a movie about freedom .... of thought and action . You have to keep on hoping when there is darkness all around . But that is only on a spiritual plane . It is also an excellent prison movie with a convincing storyline and excellent performances from Robbins and Freeman . I think it is a must see for all ... not only once but many many times . And every time you will find it different.	10
 One of the best movies ever made	In my opinion, it deserves to be in AFI's top 10 of all time. Just one of those extremely rare movie experiences. The highest compliment I can pay it is that every movie I have watched since Shawshank has paled in comparison. I've never been so involved in a movie from beginning to end. And the ending is so incredible it provides inner joy you can't even express. Gump was very good and won Oscars because of the hype and $$$ it spent & collected. But, Shawshank with no special effects or high priced productions provided better script, plot development, acting and ending than 99.9% of Hollywood films before and probably after it. Totally under-appreciated masterpiece..	10
 Nothing short of a 10!	It seems as if every movie has something about it that is unbelievable, and this movie does have one part, but except for that it is a 10 all the way which is what I rated it.  Excellent story line, acting, drama, humor, relationships... you name it.  A 10 all the way.	10
 yes, a truly great, under-appreciated film. But ranked #1???	"I have seen over 5000 films in the last 30 or so years. and as an amateur film critic, I am among the thousands (maybe millions) of movie buffs who also recognise that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one film that should be rated higher by film critics and be given more appreciation. It is superb!! entertainment!!  However! to be ranked higher than The Godfather,Citizen Kane,The Seven Samarai,Raging bull,etc, What gives?  If anybody can share with me their reasons for saying that this is THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL TIME?...over some of the films that I just mentioned, please explain. Am I missing something??"	8
 Please, please,	This movie (The Shawshank Redemption) is not the best ever. What are people thinking about? Of course it is better than 1 star - but 10???? It is a nice movie, with a fine happy ending. But to make it number one in the world, is a bit too much. There can be only one number one - and that is without a doubt The Godfather.Please everyone, try to consider your votes again - I hate to see that things are not in the right perspective. If IMDb should be accepted as the world real Bibel for film lovers, The Shawshank Redemption can't be our top movie. A lot of other movies are far better. Among them; The Godfather part 2, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Fight Club, The Prestige, Once Upon a Time in The West - and many more. Please change your votes........	8
 The Shawshank Redemption	Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A good tagline for a great prison drama from writer/director Frank Darabont (The Green Mile), based on the book by Stephen King. Basically Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is the lawyer convicted for the murder of his wife, sent to Shawshank prison, headed by the nasty Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton). While he is there he is quiet for a while, but eventually he forms a friendship with black Irish marketeer Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Morgan Freeman, and the character was originally a white red haired Irishman), retains hope and gains respect of fellow inmates. After a while, he gets to do a lot of personal work for the Warden sorting documents, founding a new library and improving a lot of other things, with his law and mathematical skills. One day though, he seems strange towards Red when he asks him to find a specific tree somewhere he knows, and the next morning, he has escaped (scraping through the soft wall with a chisel). Andy and Red do eventually find each other again in the happy emotional ending, well, many moments in the film are emotional. It was a flop in the cinemas, and since release to video and DVD it has become a favourite with many film goers. Also starring William Sadler as Heywood, Clancy Brown as Captain Byron T. Hadley, Gil Bellows as Tommy and James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Thomas Newman, Best Sound, Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Morgan Freeman was number 27 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, the film was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the scene where classical operatic music plays in the prison, it was number 23 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers, it was number 13 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die, and it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!	10
 A good disk for a scrap-booking project		1
 Beautiful	The Shawshank Redemption is a Beautiful, Touching film that can not be described in words how truly wonderful it is. I mean, come on, what can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Everyone I know (almost everyone) loves this movie. My sister (at the moment) has never seen this movie! I beg her everyday to watch it with me but she keeps putting it off. She has NO CLUE what an amazing film she isn't watching. The impact that this film has had on me, along with everyone else who has seen it, is massive. This film makes you realize how wonderful life is and how great people are (even those in jail). It defines the word Hope better then Webster's dictionary does.Also, it is in my opinion, the best film adaptation of a Stephen King story.10/10	10
 Overrated Disaster	I watched this film with truly low expectations, and i can assure you it didn't disappoint. Nothing was surprising really; very formulated -of course that's nothing new when it comes to hollywood movies- typical cinematography, childish optimism that was absolutely up the walls, a miserably failed attempt to represent a childish world as reality and of course classifying characters in the most cliché way possible; anyone is either good or bad and there's no in between. Overall exactly what a film needs to be in order to gain over-popularity, a wishy-washy story with decent acting and an unrealistic happy ending to please an impressionable audience with absolutely no ingenuity. This was an absolute disaster but again, what do you expect from the most popular movie of all time?	3
 Great film, a bit over rated	I love this film but it has simply been blown out of proportions.	1
 Worst movie ever,rated 1 out of 10 by me	I don't like this movie because it is boring and stupid,not entertaining and nothing interesting...i don't know why it is even in top 250...people,please vote 1 for this,look at movie to see how bad it is,and you will vote 1,because you will see how stupid,boring and not interesting this film is....please,vote 1 and save film art,don't let this garbage rule wonderful art of movies...how many film there are,that are truly art made of geniuses are under this garbage of film...you cannot put this garbage on first place...first place of all movies is holly place for films,it should be some masterpiece put in there...please,people,vote 1 for this garbage,i don't want to look this even in top 250...dont destroy world of film,people,boring and stupid film is not for top 250,especially not for number 1...i feel sorry for epic,legendary masterpieces that are under...this...i hate this film with all my hart and soul 1 out of 10 cheers	1
 Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.	"If this was the Wizrd of Oz or Bambi then I could understand the appeal of the movie and would rate it accordingly but what this movie is I just do not know and no one can seem to tell me when I ask so why it is considered such a great movie other than: ""Aww it was nice"". Well so are kitten videos on Youtube but should they be in the top spot of greatest movies ever made?Firstly its subject matter is crime and punishment. This is not a genre exempt from theatrical treatment, in musicals and such, but at least you know you are watching a fictitious romantic fantasy when the prisoners break out in song. There is no such device in Shawshank and here lies my problem with this movie. It simply does not in any way indicate that this is fantasy which it quite clearly is. It takes itself seriously and if you examine it seriously then it has serious flaws of deliberate making. If these were accidental then I could possibly forgive them but the fact is the audience is being manipulated like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. For those of you who do not remember it was one of the many tear-jerking TV shows in the 70s with Michael Landon (Lord have mercy on him). It is not that I am against tear-jerkers as such. I cried at the end of The Champ, like most. I can take my portion of treacle in measured doses. It is not that Shawshank is just sentimental. It is the fact that it masquerades as something else. To be fair this is not the fault of the actors. It is technically a very well made movie. The performances are very strong so I can understand its appeal on this level. However, even these positives do not mitigate the sins of the writer. I am a fan of Stephen King and I do enjoy his stories but this is definitely not one of them. Maybe it is because it is not all his doing. I never read the novella so I am not sure how much is his and how much came from the director/writer.There were many little stabs of: ""Is this for real?"" moments in this movie but the scene that really ended my engagement was the scene where Morgan Freedman is telling the other prisoners about institutionalization. This is done to the backdrop of a paroled prisoner hanging himself. The idea of Institutionalisation as a bad thing became popular in the 1990s when this movie was made and and it was simply inserted, like so many ideas lying about without any research or care for its accuracy. The fact we have an uneducated prisoner espousing a theory that had not even been researched just threw back the curtain on the manipulator of Oz and lost me forever. The fact that suicide was used as a sentimental tool to engage the viewer in such a sham and poorly considered way is simply unforgivable in my estimation.Good fiction is meant to engage and to some extent manipulate the audience but it should be believable and due care and consideration should be taken in the treatment and presentation of the story. When you feel the hand of the manipulator, or see the strings holding up the illusion then the spell is broken and the magic is gone. A great movie should have great acting, great production, great direction and writing. This one definitely does not have great writing. This movie is not what it aspires to be. I am not even sure that it knows what it is aspiring to be. It is not serious, not realistic but at the same time does not portray itself as fantasy. So what is it supposed to be and why do people rate it so highly? I have nothing against it but to think it is considered so great when it clearly is not is an insult to all the great writers. As a schmaltzy Sunday afternoon feel-good watch it could be considered good but Great? Come on! This Movie is a non event, at best. It is is a study in form with no substance. A pretty picture of a sentimental scene that never occurred and never will. A fantasy pretending it is something else. What, I just do not know. Can anyone tell me?"	1
 Poor, Boring, Painful, Long, Slow....and all the other words which defines a bad movie		10
 Not at all the best movie.. But maybe in the top10	"I've seen a lot of movies in my days.. This one was fine, but not the best. A movie should keep you entertained, not make you think - ""When is this going to END?"" Did not deserve to be N1 in IMDb. All that surrealism, mostly boring in parts even disturbing. Maybe few of you will enjoy it, but I think it would be better if there was more done in less time rather than the opposite. The same old stuff happens, like a soup opera. You like it in the binging, you say to your self - ""This will be good, IMDb was right."" but an hour later you think "" Yeaah, been there done that, lets turn it off.."".Think about it, was this the best you've ever seen? No?"	1
 Overrated	Plenty of better movies. Don't waste your time.The plot is predictable. Story is mediocre and acting is not the best	1
 Funniest film I've seen in years	Let me start by stating that this is one of the most sad, poignant and beautiful films I've seen since Paranormal Entity. I feet that Tom Hanks' portrayal of a bored police officer was cutting edge at the time and has yet to be surpassed by any actor in any film since, excluding Shane Van Dyke's potentially career defining performance in Shane Van Dyke's Paranormal Entity (written by Shane Van Dyke). Michael Clarke Duncan's interpretation of the character John Cofey was banal to say the least, but I was more than compensated for this error in judgement with two deliciously witty comedy set pieces. One was where a rat got knocked out and one was where he forgot to put a sponge on his head. As an aside, I enjoyed the skit in which Michael Clarke Duncan refused to give Moon's Sam Rockwell a slice of bread and the bit where Tom Hanks couldn't take a wazz.In conclusion, I award this film 2 golden skulls. Half a star for the scene where the rat dies, and one star for Tim Robins crawling through a crapper. I am also awarding the film two golden skulls for the scene in which Tom Hanks bangs his wife after John Cofey heals him.Overall - 3 golden skulls (Paranormal Entity earned 9 golden skulls) cheers	3
 Amazing action movie	Amazing and full of action a sci-fi movie! Great job!	8
 .....I was recommended to watch this God.awful movie	......I was recommended to watch this God.awful movie	9
 Great Film	This is a Film I try to watch atleast a few times a year, it is impact full and gripping, the story line was well written. Definately a Recommended film	7
 Good Movie and That's It. Overrated	"This movie is the best example of that. It is solid, good movie, fine story, has a "" optimistic message about hope"" and has a happy end. Actors are fine, nothing special and storyline is somewhat naive.By no means this is 9.3 movie. It is simply overrated, it has incredible hype and lots of people put it on their ""best list"" by default.This is 7.3-7.4 movie at best. It has many flaws, story is not dramatic enough, it is not real and raw. Story is a bit naive also, Tim Robbins is so-so at best. It is worth to watch, but nothing more."	7
 Don't get the hype	It's boring, i don't care about the characters. Overrated to madness. The movie could have been way darker, feels like a disney adventure.Great acting, ok story.	4
 About this flick	Awesome Flick! love how the story line makes perfect sense, Enjoy every scene. motivated me to gain more experience in wanting to be come an Actor and Want to gain more experience in wanting to work with many directors as well.	5
 The power of science	This movie showed how much the science could take us so far and solve a impossible issues,so i really amazed about the point but also i'm not sure that it's deserve the number 1 of the most top rated movies	8
 Best Movie I've Ever Seen	Oh man where to begin. This movie has it all. Easy to follow for both critics and normal viewers alike. This film has it all. The performances are amazing, especially Morgan Freeman. For God Sake he even narrates it. This film deserves the top spot on IMDb for sure. The story is great, and it really gives a great look at what prison can be like and how it can affect a man. It also has one of the most satisfying endings in film history. Stephen King may be a creepy guy but boy does his books make incredible movies. I recommend this movie to literally everyone (except small children) who are looking for an emotional, heart-warming, tear-jerking, amazingly created movie.	10
 Very good	Very good film, would recommend. It's a violent film so not for the heart lighted. From start to middle to finish it gets you edging out of your seat. The characters are believable. The special affects are brilliant. If you scared of violence or don't like blood and guts don't watch this film. I loved the different scenes. My son loved this film well he would he is a teenager and loves all the fighting scenes that where in this film. On the other hand my daughter disliked the film because she like films that are not violent like this film is. I would recommend this film to people who like fast pace films. As I mentioned before the special affects are brilliant and it must have cost a fortune to make this film.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption		10
 The Shawshank Redemption	Written and directed by Frank Darabont in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption is a film about a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) who is wrongly accused of and sent to prison for the murder of his cheating wife and her lover. During his stay in prison he becomes a financial adviser to the guards and the warden. The warden is involved in taking bribes and enlists Andy to hide this illegal money. Andy befriends Red (Morgan Freeman) the guy in the joint that can get things on the inside and they become close friends throughout the movie. This is a well written story and seemed to be a good escape from everyday life, but does not qualify as one of my all time favorite movies. I thought that filming most of the movie in a prison was kind of boring and the lack of action or any type of visual effects made it a little dull. This is not a movie I would watch again and again. The pace is just so slow.	6
 The Shawshank Redemption takes a prison drama and twists it into a fascinating existential treatise.	The Shawshank Redemption is a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted. The story is about a banker (Tim Robbins), wrongly convicted of killing his wife and her lover, who finds the strength to deal with the brutality of prison, thanks to a murderer serving a life term.The film is a tense drama of injustice and male dignity, brilliantly adapted from Stephen King's story, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman at their peak. A satisfying, audience-pleasing film. It has enjoyed a curious after-life. On its release in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption had mixed reviews and grossed just $28 million in the US; it did not make the list of Top 50 films at the box-office for that year. Yet in 2001, Channel 4 TV viewers voted it their third favourite film of all time, behind only the Star Wars and Godfather films. Readers of Time Out and Empire magazines also named it among their very favourites.	9
 Most Overrated Film on the IMDb	"OK OK OK Shawshank's a very good film. Not in MY top 25, or even top 50, but it's a good film. Robbins and Freeman certainly work magic and the story is quite entertaining, if a tad predictable, especially the Hollywood happy ending. However, this film is FAR from being the ""#2"" best movie in the IMDb top 250. In fact, Shawshank Redemption as the # 2 film is the most overrated anything I've ever come across. Maybe somebody will rank Paulie Shore as the # 2 greatest actor, but until that time this one wins most overrated, hands down. I really don't think this film deserves a 3 rating, heck I might give it a 5, but if there's folks blowing this thing way out of proportion with 10's then somebody's got to slip an underrating in there just to weed out the Shawshank homers...."	6
 Sadly, maybe the most over-rated film ever made		8
 Hu-hu, let's have a redeeming debate over this		6
 Why is it so great?	"It's nice. It's somewhat clever. Just too formulaic with the ""noble prisoners"" struggling against the corrupt and evil prison system. It would be nice to see a movie that actually thought ILL of prisoners (as we should). Same aul, same aul."	6
 Magnificent	"I just saw this movie yesterday and now I feel ridiculous for waiting so long.  It was really great and I am sorry it did not win any Oscars, because it deserved to win more than ""Forrest Gump"", in my opinion.  Tim Robbins actually played a likable guy and Morgan Freeman was perfection.SPOILER ALERT!!!I cried when ""Red"" was given parole! I also should have known what was going to happen to Tommy Williams, but that caught me by surprise.I do have one problem with the movie, but I got over it right away and did not diminish from the entire experience.  If Andy's cell was on an upper level, and in between other cells, where was this tunnel he built actually supposed to be? The ending was very cathartic, thank God.  After the brutality and injustice portrayed in the movie, we needed that. And the ending was very beautiful too."	10
 Seek and killer	Wow. I love this movie. To date I have probably watched it nearly 40 times... I am not obsessive, whenever it is on, I watch it.For most movies, at least the dramatic ones, I measure them based on how they make me feel. This one makes me feel sad when Brooks dies, angry when Tommy dies, and happy when Red finds his friend. This movie makes me feel good. I know that is not very scientific, but it's the truth. Because of the way it plays on me, I can't help but give it a 10. Here's why: First off, the acting. Tim Robbins is SO subtle that he strikes me as a person that tries to bury his innocence, because in reality it does not matter. Few would argue that Morgan Freeman is brilliant, as usual. But here the supporting cast throws in with equally impressive performances.The Score. Outside the music from the records appearing in the movie, the relatively unrestrictive score just helps us confirm what our eyes see, the walls of Shawshank. We feel them, through the music, and break through them as Andy does.And last but not least, My compliments on the cinematography. The site is perfect for the movie, and the clever camera angles and lighting invite us into the dreary prison world.just the joke :D	1
 Pathos galore	Too sentimental, too pathetic, too slow, too conventionally made, and the voice over explaining everything ruins it completely, making it boring as hell. By far the most overrated film of all times.	1
 great...		1
 Number 2 all time?	Great movie but number 2 all time?  Get real.  Morgan Freeman is great, Tim Robbins is at his pinnacle and the screenplay keeps things interesting throughout.  At times the direction is a bit klunky, and not all of the supporting characters are believable.  It certainly deserves a place in the 100 top movies, but not in the top 50.	8
 Overrated !!!	This movie is the most overrated movie of all time. The beginning of the movie is disgusting. Then it passes slowly , slowly , slowly ! .. There are no events !!! only a bunch of people in prison talking to each other.. that's it !! The movie was boring and long.. I mean very boring .. If it was not rated as 9.3 I would just stop watching the movie. But because of the high rating and all the fuss about it I just continued watching it. The ending was absolutely hilarious ! Common !!! a very funny twist that was predictable. But the way they presented that twist to us was hilarious ! Believe me , don't watch this movie, it is literally overrated. If there was zero rating, then this movie deserves it !	1
 Cop bos izlemeyin amk	Cop film izlemeyin pepe daha iyi amk pepe izleyin.	1
 Good but not great	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman to very good actors star in this movie about Tim wrongfully accused and sent to prison where he befriends Morgan Freeman. I mean it was a good movie and a i liked it, it just didn't blow me away and I guess thats how I rate a movie from Good or Great, I like it don't get me wrong, its just i didn't get the same feeling i get from other great movies, it didn't have me thinking about the character, whats happening next, it wasn't riveting, it was kinda slow I guess just dragging from scene to scene. To be perfectly honest I would personally rank this movie at like an 8.1 - 8.2, I guess I just kinda figured that he would get out, and a movie like that where you can pretty much guess whats going to happen there is much to stay and watch, I didn't feel they would leave the movie with him in prison and thats pretty much what did it for me.I mean this is purely my opinion, I know some people who love this movie and they bring up their valid points, but right now I am sharing my point of view with everyone about this movie.	2
 asdgdjg	AXDsfdgjhkj,lmgvncbvcZvxbcngfjnghkcguluifthfykitculouipui9pgfghxfufxujhzrujxr	5
 Welcome to the most overrated movie of all times	I have read tons of people getting off watching this pile of random prison drama, and I cannot believe this is the highest rated movie on IMDb. I never liked Morgan Freeman. Really. He always plays the wise man in movies, and that is quite unbearable. Not only it jails him (lol) to a specific, unrisky role as an actor, but it's also outrageously pretentious. Tim Robbins is OK I guess. So you get to see some fishy business involving cigarettes and rocks for two hours, spiced by some five-year-old melancholic philosophy. End of story, If you like prison drama, go watch The Green Mile. I wasted two hours so you won't, you're welcome.	5
 Not worth the hype, a script full of shortcuts	Stephen King is of course, a gifted storyteller. Maybe this might not be his most personal writing, if you want to read a very insightful book on prison detention and the atrocities and misconducts that exist, read the Star Rover, it is fantastic.To me, this is filled with far too many shortcuts, basically everything is in hand for Dusfrene to escape. The perfect location, the cell on the extremity of the facility floor, yet we can't really see where the foundation leads to, apparently it leads into the pipelines. Also the great timing, the fact that he manages to work out taxes, bills, finances for a 100 person, and in charge of the library, and with a rock hammer that he trades from Red, he breaches a cement wall. I don't get how any of this is realistic - since it's a King's series, might as well turn into a fantasy. But it's incoherent, lacks coherent flow, it intends to empathy with cons who really seem to be very friendly people (sort of), and might be innocent. I'm not sure these people are all quite recommendable and the camaraderie between detainees necessary - it is certainly not the same nature between workers that are part of a union. I fail to understand how a movie can go two hours and then in a span of ten minutes, retrace ten years of escape planning without giving us any hints on where Dusfrene will strike. The scenes where he is revealed that a mobster murdered his wife and her lover makes no sense, it doesn't work, I don't understand it - the scene when he plays opera is tacky - again, this movie reaches. And then of course, a post-modern ending to a movie that is set in the 60s, where two guys meet on the beach, Dusfrene treating a beat up boat. Again, the development reaches, it is just a series of shortcuts that arrange the directors in order to get through it by just being lazy. The performances are dull, there is hardly any real focus, any real acting, it doesn't focus enough on the characters, it moves too fast.This movie just doesn't work.	3

 One of the greatest films ever made!!!		
 Two Mediocre Movies in One	An UNDER-RATED movie?? Gimme a break! This is one of the most over-rated movies on IMDB! 8.7, what a joke! This movie is boring, plain and simple. You want to watch a movie 5 times so that you can put the pieces together and finally get it, fine. I'd rather watch a movie that was actually more entertaining than a jigsaw puzzle.	6
 One of the best movie ever	All i can say is its not only a movie for a film maker its a film school too	1
 WTH!!!@!	I've never seen this movie but no movie can be this good so consider ts a favor for bring the average rating down to a reasonable number.	4
 Good intent...lacks truth.	The condition of the human soul. Many movies have done it better. The reviews embrace only what they know...why don't they know more? Tom Hanks is OK. Everything about this movie is OK...but only OK. IMDb herd mentality. Internet clickings etc...Learn something about truth. Shaw s hank is missing something. There are much better social justice movies. The ridiculously high rating on the net only shows the net isn't all that its cracked up to be. There is no one in this cast that would put this movie ahead of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD...so why do you? The internet is filled with fools with keyboards. If you believe that this movie is superior to TKAM ...it only speaks to your access to a computer...nothing more. The internet is dead. Reality killed the internet star. Ooops. LOL.	4
 Good but overrated		6
 Movie sucks	This movie is horrible compared to great movies like casper. Any one reading this would be better off not watching it and instead watching spider man 3	1
 Overrated Film, typical Hollywood Style		7
 Boring & Long	this film got a 5/10 because i thought the film was too long. the storyline wasn't even that good. there is some sad bits though. i don't recommend this film to be watched when tired, because it makes you fall to sleep. good acting by Morgan freeman. a highlight of the film is it does contain some interesting theories of life. the best part of the film is the ending,very touching i also enjoyed the ending because, it meant i could go to sleep. so overall not a good film, i think its over rated. thats all i have to say on this boring film.. i hope you reading this comment has stopped you from watching this film because its a waste of your time. 143 minutes to be precise.	5
 Too long, too boring, too obvious, too King's, bah...	"It's predictable from the first to the last minute. I can't believe it's second in worldwide history. Well... first is other predictable movie (The Nerd of the Ring). This situation reminds me of Brave New World. One of the future citizens in there goes to a theater to see a movie with ""the savage"". The future and civilized man (or woman, I don't remember) is fascinated with it. But the Savage tries to make him notice that the plot was a truly rubbish, truly predictable and truly untruly. Now, what's the problem? ALL THE MOVIES ARE EQUALS. So, the future one can't distingue and decide in a correct way. He has NO OPTION. That's what is going on here. And not only in movies..."	4
 Old but Gold	Old but Gold	1
 number 1? Your kidding right?	"I looked on the IMDb list of the ""top 250."" This movie is number 1 on the list. That is way overrated. I can tell you that it was a good movie and deserves to be watched but it is not the best movie. Great acting makes this film enjoyable but the movie at times becomes boring and predictable. Good movie but not ""fantastic"" like many people seem to think. I enjoyed many other movies on the top 250 more than this film. If you want a great movie on the list check out The incredibles or the wrestler or toy story. They are better films in my opinion. Good movie but not fantastic like many people think. Way overrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!"	6
 Best movie ever?	"Just having registered with IMDb, I thought a good movie to start my reviewing with would be the one which users have rated the best of the best. This is one of my favorite films & over the years I have watched it or portions of it whenever it happening to be playing on TV, probably mustering up a good 20-30 viewings to the point that I thought I could nearly recite the films dialogue word for word. That anyone could rate any film 10 out of 10 I figure is more a function of the mind of the viewer, and its penchant for exaggeration after watching a film which happens to induce some powerful emotions in him, rather than any inherent perfection in the piece. Whatever the truth may be I offer here some reasons why this particular film, although moving and well made in it's own right, cannot be the best film made by the hands of man.#6: It seemed to me that the evidence for convicting Andy at the beginning was badly inadequate. There was no murder weapon found & no prints of his found inside the building the murders took place. His story was consistent, and though he had motive for getting wasted and driving around, its a big step to murder, and what guilty man freely admits he had a gun and planned on using it to scare the adulterers, when on trial for his life? An upright, honest man with faith and trust in the judicial system, thats who. Small wonder he was so shocked to here the judge give his sentence. And who was Andy's lawyer, Lionel Hutz?, did they not dust the murder scene for prints to give an idea of a possible involvement from another party etc?#5: The night he decides to escape just happens to be a stormy one with loud peals of thunder perfectly disguising his rocking the sewage line? c'mon!#4: The guy has been in the same cell for 19 years. All the time an enormous poster has been draped over the subway tunnel like hole to freedom he has been digging away at each night. No guard in that span felt he might have a curious peek-a-boo under the poster during the cell checks?#3: I was a little incredulous at the good faith the warden seemed to show Andy after he had completed his 2nd warden ordered ordeal in the hole. ""Its good to have you back Andy, place has'nt been the same without you"" Did the warden remember putting Andy in the hole in the 1st place, for pleading and proving his innocence to him, remember having the man shot who could have restored Andy's life, I thought a man smart enough to contrive all of the fraudulent operations that were making the warden rich would at least merit a small deal of suspicion from the warden. ""what else might this man be capable of?""#2: Andy's job on the outside was as a banker not a priest, the movie continues to show how clever he is and flexible at making the most of his limited resources in the joint, but when and how did he find time to memorize that enormous book that is the bible? passage for passage, line for line? his mastery of this difficult book is shown in giving the exact chapter and line reference after the warden quotes him a segment of the book. Perhaps that is why his wife wanted to leave him, after work he was up all night till 4am memorizing segments of the bible, but more likely not.#1: Finally and I thought most implausibly, the new guy Andy taught to read and write just happened to have the information on the ""real killer"" For this to happen I thought the following chance happenings would have to conspire: 1: he happens to share a cell with the killer at some other prison 2: the killer chooses to tell him that he killed a couple & a banker got the blame for it 3: he finds himself in another prison where Andy resides 4: of the many convicts, he happens to form a friendship with red and Andy and their small crew 5: red happens to spill the beans about Andy's crime to him I thought all this was a little unlikelyIn summary, great movie, great dialogue, excellent performances, and great vindication of the power of hope, the rewards of perseverance and the importance of sticking to ones core values regardless of external circumstances, not the best of the best, but what is? 7 out of 10"	7
 exaggerated movie	The movie is definitely exaggerated. there are better ones than that. this is ridiculous. the evaluation results are troubled.	1
 Way Overrated.	Best movie ever? Not even close. This is good movie, but there are 1000 good movies. Very few Great movies, and this certainly isn't great.Like others have pointed out, way overrated.Don't need to review it, as so many have already done. But I wanted to add another voice to the small group of people that acknowledge that it is getting way too much praise.This doesn't even come close to both Godfather films.	6
 its bad	Shawshank is bad film . shawshank dont have sense . i dont like characres and film dont have story for make .	1
 A film for the Idiots !!	Frank Darabont is no Orsen Welles.This is a manipulative piece of garbage which has successfully fooled many people.DONT BE A SHEEP !! THIS IS A CRAPPY MOVIE ! PERIOD !!!	1
 Yes good	Its good the quality is not great but i would love to watch k return of kings so i must write a review so i finish my porfile	2
 Good, but not Great	May be one of the best movies of cinema history. But for television audience. Not for cinema audience. You can watch that movie on TV always. But one in time in movie theater is enough, not second time. It'a not a The Godfather or The Dark Knight..I have seen many movies. And I have my personal Top 1000 list, like IMDb. And this movie set on the first 50, but not on first 10 or 20. I have seen twice that movie on DVD, but only one time in cinema. On the other hand, I have seen The Matrix 6 times, Braveheart 2 times, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy 10 times (whole three movies completely), Memento 2 times, The Dark Knight 3 times, and etc.. People likes that movie, but not adore..	7
 Triumph of the human spirit	"The Shawshank Redemption is an exciting and very emotional excursion. It is the best ""jail"" movie ever made, for sure. There's suspense, surprises, and more, but it's true greatness is in it's show of the human spirit triumphing over impossible odds. With a pair of great actors and a very nice script, The Shawshank Redemption winds up getting a 10/10 from me."	2
 Sentimental crap	Sentimental crap! Boring, over-rated beyond belief! Don't watch it-it's crap!	1
 Shawstank overrated	This movie sucks a.. and is as boring a film that's has everything been made period	1
 The most depressing movie I have ever seen.	I was recommended to watch this God-awful movie.I watched until the end. By God I wished I hadn't. It really was, undoubtedly, the most depressing film I have ever seen.	1
 This a awesome movie I have ever seen.	This is an awesome movie I have ever seen. The movie is pretty old but, the old is gold it seems in here. This is sort of prison break but the way it's been done is terrific. I am not too fond of the Tim Robbins, still he was really just the center of attraction. I think everyone should watch the movie, even the young stars as well. In my views the character Andy Dufresne was a perfect manipulator and planner, and a good friend as well. I mostly liked the chemistry between Freeman and Tim, the way Tim left some stuffs for freeman, might be needed for to go forward. And after a long time how a prisoner has become habituated with loo permission.The evens were not surprising, but the way it was reflected was tremendous. I admire this movie and all-time favorite, I watched it for almost 40 times, still fell like watching once again.	1
 Not bad, but old	Not bad, i liked the film however I would say you can tell that it is a film that is almost 2 decades old in the quality and in the plot scheme.	1
 Overrated.	Overrated. It's just a good movie. Too popular movie. It does not cause strong emotions.	7
 It's okay, nothing special	"I've heard about this movie for a long time, people talking about it; making references from this movie. I searched about it and it has a 9. Imdb score and I decided to watch it.It's an okay movie. The cinematography is good, the characters are kind of likeable. However within the first 15 minutes I cringed at the voice over of Morgan Freeman about how great Andy was, how he likes him right away... There are many more scenes that I cringed, like when they drink beer on the rooftop and Andy sitting there smiling and everybody's smiling. And the scene with the music and everybody stops doing everything and looking up. I guess there are some scenes that I like, the first part when the overweight man was beaten to death was good and I really feel bad for him; also the part the rock n roll kid got shot; I genuinely thought he was going to be given a chance ( because of how positive this movie feels to me) so when he got shot I thought:""Wow some reality"".The ending didn't inspire me at all. I didn't learn anything deep or motivational lesson from the movie and I didn't feel anything. I don't know maybe i'm just the pessimistic type."	5
 Ok	Ok, I have nothing to write. Ok, I have nothing to write. Ok, I have nothing to write	8
 Lifted from birdman of alcatraz.	Though the movie is good, it's a copy with little modifications. Watch the orignal, Birdman of alcatraz.	8
 A state of art	SjsjsjsjdDjdjxjdDjxjxhxDdjjxxjDxjxjx asxkxkxjxXjxjxjxjxDjxjx	10
 perfectfull	It is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me. Watching very, very impressed. What it might be called the great stories of Stephen King anyway. Acting on cues can say is enormous. There's no posturing. Especially when Andy Dufrense incredible music that review still stands wandering on everyone's lips. Finale as you lose yourself in it is a movie you are getting into. Finals if he so exhilarating you a high-quality music. And finding that deserves really deserve. I watched this film very young age and it has taught me that the magic of cinema in a nice way. This film is one of the reasons I hate the Oscars. Will remain as the best film in more than 10 years, I believe wholeheartedly sites. Definitely one of the best films in the world.	10
 Brilliant movie	This movie is not your ordinary today movie flick. It has a great and deep message.. 7 Oscar's Awarded movie.You guys should watch this movie... When you will be free..Brilliant movie...	10
 Emotional rollercoaster.	This film is filled with all kinds of emotions. No doubt this is simply a masterpiece. The movie has shown what a knowledgeable man can do. Definately made me a better person within.	10
 I couldn't find 20 stars that's why I gave 10	"Before watching this film,I read few quotes just to add them in my diary. Then I found the quote ""Hope is a good thing may be the best of all things"". I came to know that this is from the film Shawshank redemption . I started watching it. First, at the beginning,the film started with a different tone. I thought this film is going to be something about Deception,fights etc but I was wrong. It's outstanding and everyone not only film lovers but everyone likes this film. Some emotional scenes made me cry and I couldn't feel bore. I was in a journey. In journey, not to make myself feel bored, I watched this film. And after completion,I watched this again. But at last I mean the whole movie is aside a d last 45 minutes is another side. Those 45 minutes were nerve bending. The background score was awesome. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's acting is next level. All the actors Bob gunton and others have given an incredible performance. I don't know why this one couldn't get Oscars. But one thing...if you have a watch list , edit those list by putting this at top. My sincere thanks to the Movie crew for giving this masterpiece"	10
 Good, but not as good as Fanboy & Chum Chum	Andy Dufrain? More like Andy Duripoff of Fanboy from the Nickelodeon animated comedy series, Fanboy & Chum Chum	2
 Just Great	I love everything about this movie, it gives you a great feeling while watching it.Movie directing at its best.I love the sceene where they taste their beers in the roof while sunset it is so powerful that sceene.	10
 Best Sample of Overratings	Filming, acting and story is really good but 10/10 really? No isn't	
 Film no. 1 in the world.	Many years I didn't understand why this film is the top rated on IMDb because I didn't watch it. When I did it I wouldn't have any questions. You watch the film and you believe this story. Wondrous cast did the great work, Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best friends at films ever. Actors in supporting roles did their work great too.So this film is really the best in the world.	10
 good show	Mustch fun mutch love.and bring more seasons out plz.	5
 aweosme	I think this is one of the best films ever made, Morgan freeman is ameizing, is hard to understand life without the final outcome	6
 ok maby good	Ok dont seen this movie,adaadsssssssasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasasas	7
 Possibly the most overrated movie of all time		7
 !	Nice (only doing it for my profile checkout)Should watch though	7
 Love the movie	"In terms of narrative performance, the film sublimates the theme of ""freedom"". The so-called freedom is also hope. There are many things in the movie that symbolize the oppression of freedom, and Andy mentioned ""hope"" to Red more than once. Although Andy was physically and psychologically imprisoned from this prison, he did not give up his pursuit and desire for freedom and hope. Andy: that's right. Andy: that's right. Through these, the film has been telling us the true value and meaning of ""hope"" and ""freedom""."	9

 ok	"Soundtrack is a ""must buy"" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, ""That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!"" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my ""favorite of all time"", but they've all fallen far short of ""The Shawshank Redemption"". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the ""employee picks"" section"	1
 Overrated	The Shawshank Redemption is a redemption story in which the main character committed no crime of which to be redeemed. Although the hopeful message resonates with audiences, The Shawshank Redemption is not the greatest movie ever made: Every character is a stereotype, the cinematography is bland, and the pace is slow.	
 A bit overrated. 8.7 rating	The shawshank redemption is a great movie. The story of the movie and the messages about love, friendship, hope and the best of them freedom and how freedom can change the person and how the prison had a lot of incident people and all of this with the great performance of tim Robbins and the remarkable voice of Morgan freeman all of this is so great but this don't mean that the movie has issues at least in my opinion there was one character at the movie we had to know more about him i don't want to say who he was because this review is no spoilers and the second issue of the movie is it didn't make any sense that warden Norton character trust a prisoner that much and didn't even have suspension to him again i don't want to say who was the prisoner because this review is no spoilers so the movie is great but it's not that very huge masterpiece! It's not the best movie of all time! It's not the non issues movie!	9

 BEST MOVIE	Awesome Movie.One of the best movie i have ever seen.Really it deserve 1st position.	8
 Hmmm	It does not deserve 9.3 rate! It is just a usual film. There is nothing uncommon. I cannot get, what people find here!	6
 Simply the Best	"What to say about Shawshank, and why to say it when so many have tried. It is simply the best movie that you can see. My wife watched it and she doesn't understand why it is so powerful to me. What I've found is that this movie speaks to the soul of men. It's a tale of ultimate injustice, hope, friendship, and perseverance. Core themes that resonate deeply with men especially.Tim's acting of Andy's indignation about his misfortune is masterful. Morgan's acting of Red's rediscovery of purpose is extremely satisfying. Two men from different walks of life, become the unlikely best of friends that makes everyone happy to invest in.If you're only into explosions and nudity, this one isn't for you. If you want a movie that lays out bare what makes a man go on, here you go. ""Get busy living.."""	10

 There is an option for this film	"I cannot deny two things:1. Stephen King is the master of horror / suspense2. If the crowd decides to like something, no matter what it is, there no way no one can stop it.If you are irritated by the amount of votes of ""Shawshank redemption,"" perhaps you will find Akira Kurosawa´s ""Runaway train"" not so cliché prison film."	8

 Terribly Overrated.	The Shawshank Redemption is a cliché. It pales in comparison to much older (now often overlooked) movies of decades past. Do yourself a favour and do some digging - it won't take you long to find many, more thoughtful, more satisfying films of this type.	5

 the best movie of the past	One of my favorite movies ever,The Shawshank Redemption is a modern day classic as it tells the story of two inmates who become friends and find solace over the years in which this movie takes place.This includes some of Hollywood's best critics including EW's Owen Gleiberman who originally gave the film a B- back in late '94. Yet over time, this story of redemption	7
 Movie with awesome dialogue.	This movie has a awesome dialogues. After End game ,the only movie whose dialogue I liked are of The Shawshank Redemption . Though many will find this movie a bit boring as it neither have any comedy scenes nor a great suspense .	7
 Lolll	It's a very good movie unlike other movies that are predictable	6
 I don´t understand	It's not that good. For me it is average. I mean, there other dramas I'd prefer to see before repeating this movie.	7
 The Best Movie	This Film is a Best of the all world Movie. It is a Goood Dram and Good Thriler Movie.	9
 This is not the best	Shawshank Redeption is the one of the best movies in the history of cinema. However, I think this is not the best!	9
 Bad movie	Don't like this movie because it does not seem right for me	
 I don't need super hero, but a normal human	I can only see a man who been misjailed and break out, what he's done was just break out a jail while suffering the pain, I know it's really sweet to feel like that, but I can not see any idea the the director want to show but sweet scene and super hero story.7 for entertainment, 0 for phylosophy	7

 The Shawshank Redemption(1994)	I'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.	9

 About The Shawshank Redemption	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	9
 One of the best	This is one of the best movies ever. It has everything you could ask for. Drama, Superior Acting, a sprinkle of comedy. Absolute perfection.	10

 Hope can set you free	Wonderful, wonderful movie.It starts from a convict hoping for something and it beautifully shows the whole journey fulfilling the hope. Not for a moment I thought, I was watching a movie, it felt like living each moment.The plot summary says story of 2 prisoners, but I was moved by third one story.And the ending it was a sheer surprise, I was stunned to say the least.Must watch for anyone who hopes for something.	10
 CHMG's Review	What can I say that hasn't already been said before? Probably no much, so i'll repeat what almost everyone else on the planet has said before. This movie is fantastic. If you haven't seen it and you get the chance to, watch it.	10

 GOAT	One of the best movie I have seen. Won't ruin the motion picture, yet when it gets all the more broadly discharged, this is certainly a decent contender for your end of the week at the theater. An exceptionally reviving motion picture that addresses the general subject of family and love, yet from an Eastern setting in China and parts of it in America.	9
 Wonderful story	Wonderful storyI feel contact, suspense and excitement with the story and actors was carefully selectedI recommend watching this movie	10
 The best movie that I have seen	Very good movie ,I've seen it twice .definitely worth about 10/10it's worth seeing it once.	10

 Amazing Storytelling	This film is an example of Stephen King at his absolute best! The music and cinematography are also top drawer. You cannot help but get drawn in by the characters in the piece and genuinely begin to feel the longing and hopelessness of prison life in this era. One of my top 25 movies of all time!	10
 One of the best movie ever made	One of the best movie ever made! This movie has high quality in each aspect, from directing to editing.

 WOW	I simply have no words for this one. I didn't see it for the longest for the fear of being disappointed but boy was I wrong. Everything from casting to acting to dialogue and directing, its perfect and worth how many ever times you might want to watch it.	10
 Still a great watch;)	King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.	10
 great movie	I love this movie,a lot it is by far the most emotionzl movie i've seen in my life.	10
 enjoyed it	Great film watched it twice with my family and didn't get tired of it which is always a good sign. would recommend .	9
 The best motivating movie	I recommend to watch this movie to everyone. Very inspiring and motivating.	10
 The best movie ever made	Everything is perfect. Acting, screenplay, directing. Stephen King is a hell of a writer despite awfull movies like The Langoliers, The Tommyknockers and IT (1990), the books from which those movies were adapted are awesome, so either you do a great movie out of a Stephen King story or a really terrible one.	10
 One of the greatest movies of all times	"""Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild""A phrase that I memorized and even used couple of times in my life, after hearind it :DWithout much talking, do watch it if you haven't seen it yet."	10
 Amazing	He greatest movie I have ever seen in my whole life	10

 meaningful but boring!!!!!	A standard and appropriate movie but this film is boring and lacking any excitement ,the film process is very slow.Overall to me, it's a completely ordinary movie and with the expectation that I had this film (As one of the best film in the history of cinema) , it is far away .This film is much weaker than the one who wants to be named the best film of history!!!!	5

 my	Can Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.By creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.While maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.With work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.With all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	10
 Must see movue	Loved this mivue must see. This is a very interesting movie and a must see. Action packed and popcorn and chill.	3
" ""irritating, frustating feeling"" in his shoes..."	"Opening is just a gateway to this world. Ewerything inside is plausible. The ""main man"" is just like Tom Hanks, still just his own. ""Green mile""...different attitude here, but same berries are being picked. Friendship and brotherhood are apreciated high! Watch and see, u won't be miss lead or disappointed!"	
 A mesmerizing story	This movie is perfect in every sense. It depicts real life and tells us to look for hope even when everything is lost. Keep focus on what our inner energies are guiding us towards. And it proves that patience is the key to success.A very heartwarming experience and a must watch for everyone on planet earth!	9

 Shawshank is the perfect	The most overrated movie of the century. Shawshank is the perfect example of a film that can fool you into thinking it's great. It's mawkish, fantastical, sappy and manipulative. It's merely good and it's laughably that people actually place it next to masterpieces such as Rashomon, Citizen Kane, Notorious, Apocalypse Now, 2001 and Raging Bull	10

 Can understand why it's loved	A great film that is better with the amount of times you have seen it. Morgan Freeman is a brilliant supporting actor in this film. A must see movie	8
 This is not the best film ever done	I watched this movie around a decade after its release. Back then, internet was not everywhere and probably imdb did not exist.I remember the movie.I did not like it, but it was not terrible either. It is a movie about the framing of an innocent,it is about all the bad things he went through and finally comes redemption. That's it pretty much. Do not expect a classic movie. I was not moved by the movie,I was not excited ,I did not have anything to contemplate. It was a simple story. It is not bad, but please don't tell me that this is the best movie ever made. This is absurd. I have watched so many movies in my life and I have watched masterpieces. I cannot believe people said this was the greatest movie. Do not have so high expectations if you want to watch it. You will end up disappointed.	6

 Spectacular	This is such a spectacular and mysterious movie.The lead guy plays his role like a Loki.	10
 Good but extremely overrated	It's pretty obvious that this movie got to the top thanks to its publishing date (1994).IMDb became a viable site in 1994 and this was one of the best movies of that year. From there on - inertia.Why 6 out of 10? Cliché, Waaay tooo much. That's whyIMDb should be ashamed of its algorith. Strike it down..	6
 Nice Movie	I didn't watch it. but heard about it here so i just had to review itt by force to complete my profiel.	8
 best movie i have ever seen		6
 Number 01 movie of the world	"This is the Best movie of the world..""The Shawshank Redemption"" is so engrained in cinematic history, it's easy to forget it began with King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope."	10
 Wow	Best movie ever made.. watching it the 5th time now	10
 One of the best if not the best movie ever made	I can't tell you anything because the beauty of a movie is watching it, if you're reading this and haven't watched it you're messing on one of the best experiences that the cinema can offer	10

 Spoiler Film Review: The Shawshank Redemption	Film Review: The Shawshank Redemption This drama set in the year of 1940's involves a banker by the name of Andy Dufresne, as played by Tim Robbins, being jailed for the crime of murdering his wife and her lover. This screen play was written as well as directed by Frank Darabont and was produced by Niki Marvin. The film itself is based on the novel Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King. The Prison Warden, Samuel Norton, as played by Bob Gunton employs the aid of Andy for many financial endeavors and The voiceover in the film was provided by Ellis Redding, also known as Red, as played by Morgan Freeman and Brooks Hatlen, as played by James Whitmore.  The plot involves Andy enduring heinous acts of torture in prison while serving 2 life sentences all for a crime that only he knows he did not commit. Gaining the trust and kinship of Red allows Andy to adapt to prison life. The theme throughout the movie involves the motion of hope. Although the prison life does not offer any thoughts of freedom behind bars, the thoughts of hope keep many prisoners sane throughout the duration of time they must spend while locked away.  Many of the motif's throughout the film included hope, power, freedom, fear, persistence, rehabilitation, and salvation. An example of hope included Andy playing opera music for all of the prison to hear. Although the music was not long lived, the music served as a sign of hope not only for Andy, but the entire lot of prisoners as well. An example of power included the scene when Andy was almost tossed off of the roof top of a building by a guard. Although the audience may see Andy as helpless, he also holds a particular amount of power by telling the guard about information not previously known, thus, giving Andy power over his own life. An example of freedom within the film comes from the moment Red takes out a hammer in which he tells the viewer about tunneling out of the prison. Fear immediately begins for Andy when the judge sentences him to 2 life sentences and many particularly bad encounters with other prison members. Persistence is found when Andy's drive to fight off other prisoners never ends, but instead continues to fight them off each time they approach. Rehabilitation within the film is demonstrated within the prison itself. The main purpose of the prison is to rehabilitate the prisoners so that they can properly function within society once they are released, examples of this include the classes that are introduced, Andy teaching other prisoners basic skill sets, and the use of the library. The idea of salvation is generally current within the film as well. The bible is quoted throughout the film and used to remind Andy of freedom and safety.Sound effects, dialogue, and musical score were used to create the make-up of the soundtrack. Sounds from action off screen allowed the viewers imagination to fill in what happened in the surrounding environment. Ironic counterpoint was used within the film several times, but the first being when the musical score involved pleasantry and up-tempo beats while Andy was actually in moral dilemma from his wife leaving him for the man she was cheating on him with. Fade out was also used to depict different places within the prison at the same time action was occurring. The emotional effect/ mood is created by the effects, dialogue, and musical score. The characters actions within the film, along with rhythmic elements that match visual elements help to create a smooth and concise transition from scene to scene. The style/ texture of the film involves a color palette that is designed to communicate aspects of character placement, setting, and story to the viewer. For example, the clothing wore within the film by the prisoners was not colorful, but instead demonstrated that of individuals that do not have much say within their environment. On the other hand, the guards of the prison wear sharp, brightly colored uniforms that demonstrate their dominance over structure within the prison. Although thoughts of prison life may be discouraging, the movie attempts to elevate the theme for hope throughout.	10

 Pure storytelling	This film has moved me in was I struggle to describe. From the style of filming to the script and actors, it is all phenomenal and culminates in what I consider to be the greatest piece of cinema I have ever seen. This is pure and absolute storytelling. It simultaneously shocking, heartwarming, brutal and meaningful. But most of all the story is hopeful in a way that I have never experienced.	10

 Powerful & Moving	One of the most masterful films in modern cinema history.	10
 SO MAINSTREAM	This was a very enjoyable well directed movie a great cinematography and a fantastic story from Stephen King. I gave this movie a 10/10 but it is my least favorite that i gave that rating. Cause it is so popular and every one is acting like this is the greatest movie ever. It is just a much better version of the other movies like this. And it is in no way original. The twist is executed greatly.	10
 Fabulous	One of my favourite movies and i just want to say i loved it. The acting is outstanding and it makes you think about freedom and justice	10

 Amazing film	Amazing film from start to finish. Well worth the watch.	9
 One of the Best movie ever made	One of the best movie ever made. It has such a profound effect on me that it is difficult to explain in words. Highly recommended !	10
 Magic !!	This is without any doubt one of the greatest movies of all time. The best prison movie ever that's for sure ! I can't believe it hadn't received any oscar ...Morgan Freeman's narration is really lovely , character development and the friendship between a white man and a black man not forgetting the fact that andy is inocent make the ending very emotional and successful because it touches everyone's soul	8
 An inspiring showpiece of defiance and perseverence	This is truly an inspiring film. Andy's defiance and perseverance in the face of injustice and abuse gives the film its dark and rich flavor. Buckle up and grab some nachos, you're in for a hell of a ride!	10
 A true underdog story	Shawshank Redemption is a film about the unlikely friendship between two men from different walks of life. Their paths would not have even crossed had Andy, portrayed by Tim Robbins, not been falsely imprisoned for the murder of his wife and her lover. Andy becomes friends with Red, played by Morgan Freeman; a prison bootlegger who was guilty of his crime of murder. This unlikely friendship becomes their saving grace. Their friendship makes their prison days more bearable until Andy's escape changes things. Red must serve his remaining sentence with memories of their time together. Andy left clues for Red to find him so they could be reunited.When Andy first arrives at the prison, Red and fellow inmates make bets on which new guy will break down first. Red chooses Andy on first sight. What a culture shock Andy and the new prisoners receive before they ever enter the cell block. We see them get verbally abused, stripped of their rights, showered with hoses, deloused, and made to march naked to their new homes. This stark transition makes the audience feel sympathy and humiliation for these men. When the first man breaks down that night, we see him get badly beaten by the guards. We find out in the morning that he didn't receive medical attention and died from the beating. Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies where you can help but root for the underdog. While we are unsure if Andy committed the crime he was sentenced for or not, you can't help but root for the guy. When it's revealed later on that he is not guilty, it makes you root for him even more. He had his chance to get out of prison as a free man but the warden eliminated that opportunity. The only way Andy was able to leave that prison was on his own terms. Set in 1947, Shawshank Redemption stays true to its timeframe. There are not any special effects or elaborate film techniques that wouldn't have been seen during this time. At no time is the story overshadowed by theatrics or surroundings. The lighting and sound effects appear as natural as if watching it all from across a room. The small details are what make this movie so believable. Shawshank Redemption can be compared to The Green Mile. Another film set in a 1930's prison. Both movies force the audience to look beyond the crimes the men have been convicted of and look at the man himself. Both movies have strong actors and strong supporting roles. Both movies are made with careful detail allowing the story to take center stage. While there are many prison movies out there to choose from, Shawshank Redemption tops the list. What makes this movie great is that it's not about the escape but it's about the relationships formed leading up to the escape. The real treat is seeing these friends reunited against all odds later in life.	9
 This film is very important to me.	This film is very important to me, and he tells the audience the wisdom and patience a man needs to have.	10
 Highly Overrated But Still Good	"Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	8
 The masterpiece of modern cinema	A true masterpiece of modern cinema, alongside Forrest Gump or Pulp Fiction, a film that has left its mark in the last 10 years.Frank Darabont's film, based on Stephen King's material, surprises in a way that the triumph of the human spirit over an unfortunate destiny is no longer memorable.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption	The best prison movie of all time! The word redemption in the title speaks volumes about this movie. The story of absolution for the main character is incredible. Robbins' and Freeman's portrayal of their characters is unparrelled and a true pleasure to watch. This film will be one that will be chosen for movie night in our family for years and years to come!	10
 Lost count of the number of times...	... I've watched this movie... I've cried at the end of this movie (would match the number of times watched)... Left behind whatever I was doing or watching beforehand if it comes on tv. It's just a great movie. Wonderful acting, wonderful script. Great score. Not a thing out of place for me. It's impossible not to get completely absorbed.	10
 Dev	Good contribute In film I like so much Thanks you for this movie	4
 incredible	This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time. Its thrilling and moving and just perfection. Its a movie to watch before you die for sure !	10
 Great Film	The Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film that is a must see for anybody. It has one of the most intriguing and intersting stories of any film ever, and is well-directed, acted, and written. Everything about this film is fantastic.	10
 AMAZIAG	................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................	10
 Life Giving	The Shawshank Redemption will wake you up from inside.	9
 Decent film	This is a decent film. I do think it have been far too over rated over the years though. In fact it is probably the most over rated movie in cinema history. There are several prison films that are far better. But, this is definitely worth a watch and of course you may feel I've not been very kind once you have watched it.The two main characters are played by powerful actors in Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, They are worth watching alone. The direction and overall portrayal of the film however in my opinion is rather predicable.	6
 >>>>	Maybe it was a nice movie but don't deserve the 1st movie throw all of this years	6
 Not a masterpiece, but artfully emotional.		8
 The most beautiful, inspiring movie you will ever see		10
 Impressive	Why do I want to write the 234th comment on The Shawshank Redemption? I am not sure - almost everything that could be possibly said about it has been said. But like so many other people who wrote comments, I was and am profoundly moved by this simple and eloquent depiction of hope and friendship and redemption.The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.	3
 Shawshank	The Shawshank Redemption was a true masterpiece. This is a true masterpiece	10
 los periut cnaj lerdipa	Redemption the wroote ne leave feelings mckingbird why do i wanr but berhs form 4 5	5
 Can't turn this movie off	While this might not be the greatest movie ever made even though it sits atop the IMDb chart it is one the best. If there is one movie I can sit a watch again and again it is Shawshank. Whenever it comes on TV I can just sit and watch it and enjoy the movie. It is definitely one of the most rewatchable movies I have ever seen.	10
 Just praises for a fine film!	This has got to be one of the greatest films of all time! Absolutely flawless! The acting, the story line, the scenery is amazing. Amazing directing. Just a superb production. Sorry if I'm extra with the praises but this movie will not waste your time. I saw it several years ago and can still watch it til this day and be entertained. First review on IMDb.	10
 best	this is the best movie i seen till yet One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption <3	It is really amazing movie i have ever seen in my lifetime , The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever Morgan Freeman plays the supporting character for Tim RobbinsHe creates so much emotion to this film as the narrator and supporting character to the story line I had to re-watch this film to fully appreciate every detail. This film wastes no scene, no character. Everything works. And best of all, it's one of the most fulfilling and hopeful films you can watch	7
 Best movie I have ever seen	This movie contains a lot of important topics that really matters to my practical life. actually this one is my favorite I wish I could meet the producer of the Film .... The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.	10
 Wonderfully crafted motion picture with wide appeal	"THIS is what movies are all about! A magnificent story, first-class actors, a superbly talented director, plus all the necessary attendant and supporting talents including set design, lighting, music, scripting, and all else that is required in the mix to create a masterpiece. Not a moment of the film is wasted, no segment too short or too long: it is all ""just right"". Who would have thought that a story about men in a cruel prison system could be developed into a memorable movie with many marvellous messages. May I single out one of my favourite actors, James Whitmore? I cannot imagine anyone else more suited to the role than he. In fact, the casting in this epic is remarkable: all parts ideally filled with class actors. Morgan Freeman, on the other hand, is not one of my screen favourites, but it's impossible to find any fault with him, and somehow he puts his mark on the role and makes it his. Tim Robbins is perfect; each time I see this film, I appreciate his acting more and more. It's so easy to give Shawshank Redemption a TEN. Surely anything less would be an injustice? Yes, Virginia, there IS a Santa Claus !"	6
 Is this the best movie of all time? - it is not	Won't say to much about this movie, it's a good one. It has an interesting theme (but not new or reinterpreted), a nice effort in describing the characters and their transformation, yes. Some bits of good soundtrack, yes. and OK climax and overall an entertaining feature-film, yes. But how in a million years can be this the greatest MOVIE of all time? PleasePlease	
 amazing!!!	This film is one of my favorites, it teaches us patience and power of trust, with a little pin digging a whole wall to get away, best plans always come out in the hardest times such as in this film decades of patience brings you peace with it. Everything is a test in life and everything is a lesson to be learn for the future	10
 A masterpiece	Really a brain twister movie to watch. Morgen Freeman on his best along with Tim Robbins. Once you start watching you can not move on before ending it just because of its mysterious story which you will loved the most. I think one of best movie ever directed by Frank Darabont.And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.	10
 I don't know	"Im just writing this review to complete my profile, so I'm just gonna take some lyrics from All Star and put in to fill out the rest of this review. Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead"	10
 A fantastic movie everyone must watch	This is a movie about freedom and friendship. I watched this film very first in my high school class. It really impressed me with its delicate structure and intriguing plot. Since then I've watched this movie multiple times. This is a really fantastic movie I would recommend everyone to watch.	10

In addition to a critical evaluation, the review's author may assign the work a rating to indicate its relative merit. More loosely, an author may review current events, trends, or items in the news. A compilation of reviews may itself be called a review. The New York Review of Books, for instance, is a collection of essays on literature, culture, and current affairs. National Review, founded by William F. Buckley, Jr.,[1] is an influential conservative magazine, and Monthly Review is a long- running socialist periodical	10
 Are you sure that this movie is the better of every movie in the world?	"A common film about the life of people behind bars of the prison. Nothing important. Usual stupidity! I wonder why so many people have described it as a ""movie of the century""? Just because the score was ""9/10""? Oh, come on, do not have illusions. A monotonous film with a poor script. Okay, it's got a plot twist that almost leaves you loud before the end. Nothing more!"	2
 Good movie but....	"This is a good movie, but I'm surprised to see that it's got the #1 spot on IMDb's top movie list. The acting is excellent, and it has a great message; however, it's lacking a big ""wow"" moment for me. A lot of things that happened weren't necessarily ""predictable"", but I also wasn't shocked either. Still, it's a good movie that everyone should see."	7
 Problem!	Although the film is set in Maine, the Ohio State Reformatory in Mansfield, Ohio stood in for Shawshank Prison. The structure was slated to be torn down, but the production delayed its demolition for a year. After the film wrapped, all the buildings in the complex were torn down except the cell block and main administrative building, which were preserved for historical purposes.That's why I give it a 9, not a 10.Just joking. I'd give it a 9 any old day. I never give 10s.	9
 Overrated	This film wasn't that successful when it was released. Over the years since then, it's become regarded by many people as one of the best films ever made. It's an above-average prison film that's well-acted - but it's nothing special. It's slow and too long. Many fans of this film claim that it's a feel-good film - an uplifting story about friendship and mental strength. Some even claim that watching it can cure depressed viewers. However, it's a heavy-going film that includes beatings and rape.We never find out whether or not the protagonist committed the double murder that he's imprisoned for, which is a crucial point as a viewer. If he's innocent, then we should be on his side and want him to escape; if he's guilty, then he's not a sympathetic character.	6
 Great but not the best	This is a fantastic film but I don't think it deserves the top spot on the site. I would argue that The Godfather or even Citizen Kane is better. We always had to watch it in school and after knowing so well I don't think I can watch it again. But if you've never seen it then I would say it's definitely worth watching.	7
 Brilliant	It's by far the best movie i've seen in my life.It contains all the elements you need to make a brilliant movie.The chemistry between the actors is very beautiful, you feel like you know them and a friend of them.I've seen it more than 10 times and welling to see it another 10 times.A movie that catches your brith	10
 well, i hate top rated list.	i don't like the situation about this movie has been standing there top rated 1 in this list for ages. i think and most of the movie-lovers do, the Godfather trilogy is most terrific than the Shawshank Redemption. and Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro deserve a place than being second. sorry IMDb but i hate your top rated list :/	8
 One of the best	This movie makes me so interesting. i like main actor the most. His character is so mystic, strong, brave and intelligent.what he did to escape from the prison. his plan was so smart and precise. the ending is so good. i could't predict it until i watched. good man was free and bad man was punished.	10
 Best picture without Oscar	I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film. What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. The way of narration by freeman,despite being best movie in history, the sad thing is the movie could not get the best picture awards at Oscar. The Oscar went to Forrest gump.	10
 you won't move your eyes off the screen..	No wonder why this movie is on top .... an excellent composition of storyline which is depicted more by the naturality in the acting and the reality in the situations .....every second of the movie is balanced ...without any additional and impractical elements ......	10
 I agree that it's a good movie, but is it the best movie ever?	"Is this movie the best film in the world? Of course not. But choosing the best film is not that easy. Should it be a movie that was both old and western like The Good the Bad and the Ugly, a mafia movie like the godfather and sometimes boring like the Godfather or a movie that could not understand everyone's issues like Pulp Fiction? Or a superhero movie like Dark Knight? These movies are not movies that everyone will like and understand. But The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that most people can easily watch and impress. So it is unwarranted to discuss it.That's why I think you have such a high score.But in the end it's a good movie.Andy Dufresne had breakfast every morning for 20 years, tackled the job he was given, killing time with his shirt and sleeping in his cell - if he did not have an extraordinary job per day. Looking at this picture, how many brave can be found that the general lines of their lives are much different? A little bigger, but do we live in a big, reinforced concrete jail? Do we spare time because we are forced to do things that are not really relevant to our existence? Do we spend time with friends in the times that we can increase, protect ourselves against madness, and then go to sleep in a dark room? But this funky banker has a difference from our lot. Although he tried to live in accordance with the conditions he knew he could not change from his first day in prison, he never allowed his voice to be silent. He reminded himself of the fact that some of them were not convicted and worked for a world in which he set the conditions in the darkness of the darkness, in the moments when no one knew, Full 20 years! The pressures he saw were not enough to change the reality. Somewhere outside, he never forgot that life is so cold and unstable, there is a little paradise where the soul can turn its inspiration into reality.People can experience various troubles during their lifetime and can live in unhappiness for hundreds of days in a row. But remember that there is always a chance of happiness tomorrow. If you see this as a rabbit-carrot deception, it is known that maybe you are a rabbit, but the stick that the carrot is hanging is also in your hand. It is the wound that personally gives you the will. If you live in a reality illusion, you are entitled to change the direction of your precious life as long as you are breathing away.Andy Dufresne can also remind us that if the anticipation of a life that has spent almost an entire life in captivity can be reminiscent of the freedom of friend red just writing ""red was here"" once and reading it by somebody in the future. I would even go further; You are refused.The more freed you are when you are born, the more freed you are when you die. What you need to do is to fill your life with the colors of your own soul as much as possible during the period between birth and death.Here is a picture you need to remember, for all these reasons, when you find yourself struggling and looking at the walls of the house. If Shawshank Redemption is not inspiring, what is inspiring, I do not know."	7
 Great Movie	"Stephen King here is absolutely Master in book!""The Shawshank Redemption"" premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in September 1994, and opened a few weeks later. It got good reviews but did poor business (its $18 million original gross didn't cover costs; it took in only another $10 million after winning seven Oscar nominations, including best picture)."	9
 Nice Movie	Andy is introduced to the library by Brooks in 1949. Brooks points out a Louis L'Amour section, but L'Amour's first book under his own name wasn't published until 1953 (he had written a series of Hopalong Cassidy novels in the late 1940s under the name Tex Burns), and didn't produce enough books to warrant his own section until the 1960's.	7
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	"It's Really Very Good Movie,I Enjoy The Film Very Much.I Really Feel That Movie,This Movie Contains Many Serious Action,These Are Very Nice To Make.

 Best film! excellent!	A must have movie for any moviegoer.One of the best movies ever. Unforgettable performances. And one of the most amazing finals in history !!A must have movie for any moviegoer.One of the best movies ever. Unforgettable performances. And one of the most amazing finals in history !!	10
 Classic Movie	Basically, this is one of those movies you must see. If you don't, people will gasp and stand with their mouths gaping wide when you tell people you haven't seen this movie.I did think the movie was a bit slow to start, but most of the classics let the story breathe and characters develop more so than today. Simply put, this movie is about friendship in unlikely people at an unlikely place. Through all the trials it is still a feel good movie that is highly quoted and parodied to this day.	8
 Beautiful movie	Would recommend to anyone who is having a bad day. Morgan Freeman is an absolute stand out. The subtly in his acting is what makes this film, that in addition with direction and writing makes for a both inspirational and heart warming film. The Bogs and crow subplot leaves a second political note and ultimately a strong feeling for change with the audience.	8
 The story		7
 Brilliant	"The first time I viewed Shawshank Redemption I didn't find it to be anything special. Sure, stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman were good BUT their performances weren't anything special...or so I thought at the time.Frank Darabont directs Shawshank Redemption with a gentle, guiding hand allowing the actors to discover the essence within their characters. Some actors, undoubtedly, would not be up to the task. Robbins and Freeman, however, are not ""some actors."" They are consummate actors and masterful in their portrayals here.Based upon Stephen King's novella, Darabont creates a film that never buys into the drama of its story, instead choosing to present the lives of the characters involved without histrionics. I have long felt, in fact, that the film may even improve upon the novella by bringing it into focus and providing it with a pacing that allows a more explicit character development.I have noticed that many of my favorite films are ensemble pieces, and while Robbins and Freeman shine here it is actually the entire cast that brings this story to life with such grace and beauty. Supporting performances by the likes of James Whitmore, William Sadler, Gil Bellows and others who take what could be caricatures and give them in-depth personalities and thoughts and feelings.Thomas Newman's score is supremely divine and changes along with the characters. It further enhances Darabont's pacing, as well. There are so many memorable scenes in Shawshank Redemption, however, the closing scene is certainly among one of the best closing scenes ever witnessed.It is hard to fathom that a ""prison"" movie could be a source of tremendous hope, light and inspiration. Yet, to call Shawshank Redemption a prison movie is to minimize its greatness. It is a brilliant film, a study of humanity in all its wonder AND it happens to take place within the confines of a prison.Moving, brilliant, inspirational, hopeful and empowering are all words that describe ""The Shawshank Redemption."" With outstanding performances from its ensemble cast and a work of tremendous cinematic poetry by director Frank Darabont. ""Shawshank Redemption"" creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts that serves to remind us that in the darkest moments of our lives there is always a light that shines within."	9
 The best	This is my favorite movie i have ever seen in my life. I really love watching this magnificent film over and over. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins acted the main role which was extremely immersive. I think there are several sections and parts during the story which were also appeared in a great TV series, in Prison Break. It is not a coincidence that this is the best ranked movie ever on the IMDb's list. It is a pleasure watching for every age group because it's humor, for lovely characters and actors, for it's imagery and for the feeling of a dramatic ending. Beside Andy Dufresne's escape and his persistent way out of the prison, my favorite person was James Whitmore (rip) who was the kindest and loveliest man from all the prisoners. I was really sad when he died not only in the film but also in life. Finally, i can only say that this film is far, far away the most beautiful film in my movie-history, it is honor to be the top rated one.	10
 How to watch this movie	Watching movies on the internet is now much easier than it was never.There are lots of web sites that provide great online flicks as they are legit. I already have my personal web site in which i've links to legit sites that offer no-cost internet based moves and TV programs.There are 2 forms of online flicks websites. 1. Sites that provide movies which you can directly view straight away utilizing online software or a video clip player such as Divx.etc. 2. Websites where you could download flicks and burn all of them to a disk. However many movie download sites might have viruses, spyware or any other destructive content. If you are shopping for an internet movie site utilize a search engine such as Google or Yahoo! When looking around use correct research terms usually it might probably switch-up incorrect results.Source http://www.zeemasti.com	3
 best i have ever seen	"if u don't see this one then you have not seen anything The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine. friends and find a way to fight off despair."	10
 What a masterpiece !!	Where I'm I going to start , well this magnificent work of art directed by the big Frank Darabont and co-writing bu the legendary Stephen king and started by both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was just as perfect as it allows it to lead the 250 top IMDb table, yeah ,it had everything from directing ,writing and acting until good soundtracks and cinematography ,not to mention the unforeseen twisted ending which had me blocked for what it remained from the film . the shawshank redemption was overtaken in the 95th for the benefit of Forrest Gump who was truly a masterpiece and Pulp fiction who was also out of this world but still the shawshank deserved more at least for me ,I mean it is one of few who could led me into this state of admiration and worship even and for that it's and it will always be my all time favorite film .	10
 The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly		10
 The best what I have ever seen!	Fantastic story line and stunning visuals = a true masterpiece.After watching this, I really have to reconsider what I have voted for a 10 until now. It beats everything, although I can't really compare to anything I have seen before. Simply a must see, and it is worth your time, even twice! :)Not a coincidence that this film is the first one on the big list of IMDb. If I only had one wish that I would say, that I want to work in a film like that! Furthermore It has really everything in it, and the plot twists are amazing, although some of them can be expected but not surely.Maybe the exposition was long, but on the other hand it really helped to feel that kind of atmosphere.	10
 Good		10
 Best movie ever made.	The Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly deserves to be the highest rated movie. I watched this movie for the umpteenth time. A movie I would never ever get bored of. Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption. Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison. The bond that grows between the two main characters is unforgettable and the score is the best I have heard. Morgan Freeman makes us feel the sadness and Tim Robbins, the faith. The more times you watch it, the more you love it, and the more you learn from it Whatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want in a movie. If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you are beyond redemption. It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. It's in my top five movies of all time.	10
 Inspiration for Life	Phillip Fawcett piano teacher says this is the greatest redemption movie of them all. And I should know, since the music world was a life I'm only too delighted to be out of. Strictly speaking, Shawshank is not 'redemption', because after all what did the guy need redeeming 'from'? He was innocent. It is basically a giant metaphor for a journey from an entrapped and miserable existence to a beautiful promised land. It is set as a prison story, but really symbolizes any arena of life where one may feel hopeless and desperate to get out of a seemingly impossible situation.Beautifully written with a host of engaging characters, where for once the good are equally as interesting as the bad. I always find it curious that in many prison dramas when the guards, especially the warden, are the bad guys whereas the inmates (criminals, we assume) are the good. At least the protagonists are. Take Escape from Alcatraz as another example. I wonder what this says about our society and the concept of good and evil we have deep down? I believe it's a closet hatred of authority in general. A fear of the state, perhaps. With good reason.	9
 Phenomenal film!		9
 Amazing	I just finish this movie last night. I had watch it for a million times but still The Shawshank Redemption is truly one of the most amazing movie i ever watched. I have recommended this movie to many of my friends and 9 out of 10 of them give a positive feedback. What i feel after watching the movie might not be the feeling you get from it. The Shawshank Redemption motivates and give me hope to get pass the obstacles in my life. The acting, the story, the editing, the music, everything is just beautiful. No doubt that The Shawshank Redemption is #1 on the IMDb top 250 rated movies chart. I will definitely going to watch it again.	10
 One of the best of all time.	This movie has all of the best Hollywood has to offer from A-list actors to stunning scenery to a dialogue that will not leave you wanting. It delves into the mind and soul in ways you probably can't imagine. the plot seems believable as do the characters portrayed. If you have a soul, you will laugh, cry, get angry, be pleased and relieved. Andy is a character you will love and the prison workers you will hate. You really do get the whole gamut of emotions in this one. I have seen this one as many times as any other movie I've ever seen and I never get tired of it. My wife and I can sit down with this one several times a year and love it the same every time. You will love it!!	9
 Tied for my favorite movie of all time.	This ranks among my favorite movies of all time. I'd say it's tied for first place. The ending is perhaps the most satisfying ending to a movie that I've ever seen. It's not necessarily the type of movie you watch over and over, yet I have watched it several times and it's engaging entertainment each time I watch. In fact, I would say that this movie goes beyond the pure entertainment category. It's a story that is truly inspiring. Morgan Freeman's character, Red, delivers a voice-over towards the end about hope that is perhaps the best voice-over in cinema history. I know I'm laying it on thick, but I truly love this movie. There are certainly scenes that are hard to watch, as Tim Robbins character goes through many trials while incarcerated, but the way he makes it through them is quite amazing. I was surprised to learn that this is based on a piece of fiction by Stephen King, but the more I learn about him, the more I see that he writes a lot more than just horror novels. I hope to read the book one day, as I'd bet it is quite good. Every aspect of this movie is pure perfection: directing, acting, editing, soundtrack... the list goes on. It has a permanent place in my movie collection and it also should in yours.	10
 Shawshank Offers Hope	"I recently watched The Shawshank Redemption, and what stuck out to me most was the offer of hope that Andy Dufresne offers to the inmates at Shawshank. The prison is depicted to be a place where people are treated poorly, abused, assaulted in every form and through it all dehumanized completely. We see this through the life of Brooks, who lost all hope of a good and normal life in the world that he became happy in Shawshank, identifying with being a crock and only a crock there. Once he is released from prison, he contemplates what is the best way to get back in, so that he can go home. Instead, he kills himself, because he would rather die than be a free man outside of the prison walls. But, when a innocent man walks into the prison and offers hope to the inmates, lives are changed. Although all of the inmates claim to be ""innocent,""Andy was the only true innocent man in the prison, and with that he stuck out in every way. Andy reminds them that ""hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" Jesus Christ was the only truly innocent man to ever walk this Earth. Similarly, God has told us through his words that are bodies are tarnished by the worlds sin and evil. We are in a world run by our fleshly desires and sin. But, Jesus, as perfect as He is, stepped into our evil world and offered us Hope. He continues to save change lives today, many more than Andy Dufresne. Shawshank Redemption is a great feel-good, while still heart wrenching movie, but it has much more to offer than just a 2.5 hour movie. Next time you watch it, think about the life Andy is living and the example he is portraying for the other inmates, and consider the true life that Jesus Christ is trying to offer to you."	
 Perfeito	Great movie, great for watching two in the family, all Should watch this movie as a great example.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director.

 Best Film I've Ever seen	"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I believe that this film is the best story ever told on film, and I'm about to tell you why.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a city banker, wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison in 1947 and receives a double life sentence for the crime. Andy forms an unlikely friendship with ""Red"" (Morgan Freeman), the man who knows how to get things. Andy faces many trials in prison, but forms an alliance with the wardens because he is able to use his banking experience to help the corrupt officials amass personal fortunes. The story unfolds....I was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class.

The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.But the one thing which makes THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION stand above all other films, is the attention given to the story. The film depends on the story and the way in which it unravels. It's a powerful, poignant, thought-provoking, challenging film like no other. If Andy were to comment on this film, I think he might say: ""Get busy watching, or get busy dying."" Take his advice.Thoroughly recommended."	10
 Lots of questions some comments, and la dash of praise	I'm not sure that I would crawl through a pile of crap for my freedom, just saying. How did the poster get back into place? What happens to them after they have found their freedom? Do they enjoy it? Do they go back to their old ways of doing things? What kind of life do they lead?--that being said, how much time is left for them on this earth? If they believe in redemption, do they believe in an afterlife? What do they do with their money? What do they spend it on? Do they buy new clothes? Did they not have what they needed in jail? Were they not given three meals a day, a cot, a toilet. Perhaps their life was too simple and they wanted to make it more complicated. Perhaps they had grown bored with their lives and were looking for excitement. That being said, I must feel really freaking desperate, really output to crawl through a sewer, and perhaps they feel this way after being locked up for a long time. So yes, this man is brace. It seems they have change. I enjoyed watching this movie; I believe the actors played their parts well. Well-done	9
 This is my favorite film of all time.	"The plot, the acting, the big name stars all in their greatest roles. Even the music was spectacular. I give it a 10 without hesitation and watch it every time it shows up on cable. Morgan Freeman shines alongside Timothy Hutton a pairing that works for both. Freeman should have won an Academy Award for his performance. Everyone in the cast brings the dark side out of prison life along with the sometimes comedic side of doing hard time. The time line advances according to the pin-ups requested by Dufresne (Hutton) , giving the viewers an idea of the era. Freeman as ""Red"" is the jail-wise con that repeatedly is turned away by the system. A must watch."	10
 The Shawshank , The land of free men .	"I'm not going to spoil or tell you about the scenario of this movie but i'm really excited to review about the lessons i benefited from this masterpiece ,This Movie is a real gem , teach you lots of lessons about life and how bad it can hits you , The movie shows you various kinds of lessons and thoughts and how can you treat them positively , I'm gonna enumerate some of them , first is the real man is the person who can withstand a long term storm and keep going on , second it tells you never miss any opportunity even when it seems dangerous , all you have to do is embrace it , third is knowledge always rescue its seeker , fourth is hard times reveal your real friends who can sedate the pain that hard time give you especially when we're talking about the prison time , fifth is leave your own print in every place you attend just to give a sign or evidence for next visitor that you was there , sixth patience will achieve more than our force so always be patient not hasty and wait for the right time to come , and the last and the greatest quote from this amazing movie is ""Get busy living, or get busy dying "" ."	10
 An obvious classic that must be seen by everyone	If you haven't seen this masterful work of art you haven't lived. One of the only movies I can say must be seen by everyone before they die. Everything about this movie has already been said, and I can't recommend it more. GO WATCH IT!Morgan Freeman is such a great actor and he shines in this alongside every other actor. They're casted to perfection and I loved every single bit of this movie. Easily one of my favorites of all time and one of the greatest pieces of film making you will ever see in your entire lifetime. Go see this before someone spoils it for you. You are doing yourself a disfavor if you skip out on this one. There's a reason why it's the highest rated film of all time on IMDb.	10
 teen	Best movie. From the ingenious opening credits to the subversive ending, Deadpool constantly upends and tropes you're used to seeing in superhero flicks in the past few years. What's great here is the filmmakers had something weird and perverse and just went with it. Jokes about pedophilia, pegging, and sex run rampant, but it's never really dark, despite the mature subject matter. On top of that, it's also very refreshing to see a superhero in such a big studio film. It's unheard of these days. Fox and other studios, learn from this success. It's not the fact that a hard R-rated film can do well, it's that Deadpool also happens to be very good, most likely because you, Fox, actually gave the filmmakers the creative freedom to do whatever the hell they wanted.	10
 Greatest Movie Ever		10
 This is the highest rated movie on IMDb?	"Why? This is why we can't have nice things and why IMDb ratings are a joke. The Godfather and The Godfather Part II are better movies. 12 Angry Men is my favorite movie and it is a much better movie. The Third Man is better. Citizen Kane is better. Fight Club is a better movie. Judgment at Nuremberg is a better film. One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is better. Seven Samurai is a better movie and it is in Japanese. Das Boot is better. It is in German. M is better--and it is in German. Goodfellas is better. Platoon is a better movie. Touch of Evil is a better film. Spotlight is better. There Will Be Blood is better. Chinatown is better. Ran is a better movie. It is in Japanese. All About Eve is better. Up is better. To Kill a Mockingbird is better. Amélie is a better film--and it is in French. I could easily name two score other movies that are better than the highly overrated ""The Shawshank Redemption.""Pathetic."	8
 Movie of the century	"This is the best movie i've watched so far till now. The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	10
 Best film I've watched so far !	I can totally agree that hope is the main theme in this movie. I'd like to add that faith, a virtue similar to hope, is apparent in Red's character. His unwavering belief and fascination with Andy's stoic character eventually led him to 1.) keep his promise to survive outside of prison and not succumb to the same fate that (Brooks the old Librarian) 2.) Live in beautiful Mexico with Andy in the end. I think it's just as important that Red stayed by Andy's side throughout the movie and was handsomely rewarded. I guess it's similar to the theme of friendship you pointed out in the beginning. i writ-ed lot of articles about it here : http://www.alcoderz.com	9
 best movie	"One of my favorite movies. It's a must see movie in my opinion. Seriously one of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. The cast is first rate with everyone giving a great performance. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman carry the movie, but Bob Gunton and Clancy Brown are perfect as the Warden Norton and prison guard captain Hadley respectively. And James Whitmore's portrayal of an elderly inmate Brooks is moving. The screenplay gives almost every actor at least one or more memorable lines through out the film. As well as a very surprising ""twist"" near the end that almost knocked me out of my chair. If you have not seen this movie rent it or better yet buy it. As I bet you'll want to see this one more than once."	10
 Top Notch Motivational movie	I have watched this title multiple times not just for its motivational value which is top notch but also for its dialogues. Despite the pace of the movie, It doesn't bore you at any point. It doesn't matter whether the protagonist gets redemption or not. His character shows utmost patient positivism towards life which is what many of lose at one moment or the other.Both lead actors have played their roles well. In certain parts, I wasn't comfortable with the main protagonist being too perfect playing the situation around him like a violin. But then he has his own moments of agony. A motivational story is one which keeps a balance between its hero's talent and adversaries around him. The struggle must look real which the story does comply with.	9
 Great Movie	"The Shawshank Redemption follows Andy Dufresne, a banker accused of the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, he meets an inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding, who Dufresne befriends. Redding is the narrator of the movie talking about his past experience at Shawshank. Over the 19 year period that the movie takes place, Red and Dufresne grow closer, and the tale follows tragic losses of friends, corruption of the prison's staff, and a great escape. This movie is a great movie for those who like a 'justice served' type movie as well as a well written one. In general, foreshadowing indicates that the story is well written enough to the point where the writers can make a reference to the future about what is going to happen. In one scene, Dufresne is carving names into the walls in his cell block. The scene then shifts to Dufresne asking Red if he can acquire a poster (because Red is the guy who can 'get things' in prison). Throughout the entire movie, every scene in Dufresnes cell shows that poster. At the end of the movie it is revealed that the poster hanging on the wall was used to cover a hole that Dufresne had been digging since the night he was carving the names in the wall. He accidentally discovered how flimsy the walls were, and realized he could tunnel out. This makes the movie good because the scenes leading up to the end hinted at the fact that there was something special about the poster, however the audience was never sure. When it was revealed at the end, the audience can make the connection between that night he asked for the poster and the scene where the hole is discovered. Andy Dufresne is accused of murdering his wife and her lover, however it is never actually revealed if he did it or not. The movie goes along hinting that Dufresne is innocent and although it is never confirmed, I found myself trusting the fact that he did not do it. Throughout the movie, Dufresne is treated very poorly, such as being used to launder money for the prison due to his banking background. So when news comes in of a new inmate who confessed to Dufresne crime, Dufresne tries to convince the Warden that he is innocent and demands a retrial or probation. The Warden denies him but at a cost; Dufresne escapes and reveals the corruption at Shawshank causing the Warden to commit suicide to avoid arrest. In general, people who pity Dufresne in his position would feel that he won in the end, escaping the prison and revealing the warden's corruption. This is enjoyable because it has a sense of karma, where because the warden treated Dufresne so poorly, he got fooled in the end. Therefore, this movie is a good movie for people who enjoy social justice type movies, because Dufresne beat the Warden and escaped the prison, as well as for people who enjoy deep movies, that are well written, as demonstrated through the foreshadowing that the writers put into it."	10
 A whole package worth watching for	This movie made its entry into my list of favorite movies. I loved the plot, dialogues, aspects of life displayed here and so on. I would recommend it to everyone to watch it and you will be contented at the end.This movie made its entry into my list of favorite movies.

 labeled as that 'unique prison movie'	This movie is the first in the top 250 list and I agree that it's a masterpiece. The actors chosen were incredible and the whole story was extremely interesting and involving. However, there were few flaws. In my opinion, the movie needed more action. Even thought the tension and action was building up as the minutes passed, it was not growing fast enough and after some time it get a little boring. Thankfully, the ending is astonishing and it makes you forget all the bad things that happened before in the movie. It can easily be labeled as that 'unique prison movie' which will never be over-passed in this category because there's never going to me a movie like this. There's no doubt that Morgan Freeman is the hero of the film with his acting and effort. In the end, the movie is a real masterpiece but I cannot call it the best movie ever made.	8
 Hope is a good thing, may be the best of all, and good things never die	"Such a perfect film without any actress. Such a different life with a different salvation.Just as I do not want to be ""brave heart"" to confuse the same, when Wallace shouted freedom, that moment, although the blood boiling, but gradually after cooling it is extremely pale. We need to be free, we just need freedom, what we need is what kind of freedom? The reality is that I am still in the disease, although a small cold can be made from the mix is also people do not want to live. This Andy 20 years of Tolerance immeasurably, let alone 40 years of Rhee fate. Disease can be cured, the fate of it? Andy does not give me the condemnation of the hysteria, how can win the day? Andy does not give me over his hysteria, sitting on the bench how people can afford to move a stool?Andy made me believe in hope. He made me believe that even if the digging of authentic plans failed, he still retains hope; even in the face of irretrievable death, he still has no one can stop the stick, just as no one can take away his mind Mozart."	10

 Unlikely turn of events	What an enjoyable movie The Shawshank Redemption turned out to be and a true classic. At first glance, the title immediately through me off. It honestly didn't seem like the type of movie I would like. As I got further into the movie however, the storyline began to catch my interest. Andy Dufresne is a well to do banker. He seems intelligent, somewhat corny and well to do. You can imagine my confusion as to how he winds up in prison. Through an interesting plot twist early on in the movie, it seems Andy is falsely accused of a horrendous crime and sentenced to time in prison. Right from the beginning he hits it off with Red, a black older gentleman who seems to be the go to man for everything. Throughout the film Red and Andy develop a loyal friendship that gets them both through the many years of imprisonment. While doing time Andy finds out that there is a way to prove his innocence and is hopeful that he will be released. After expressing that hope to Norton, the warden Andy realizes that he has no intention of helping him and that he would face many more years behind bars. This realization causes Andy to do the unthinkable and Right from the start I felt like the theme was going to be along the lines of hope, never giving up, make the most of your situation or never judge a book by its cover. Andy kept his cool and was hopeful that he would be 'redeemed' throughout most of the movie. You get the sense that he knew he would be proved innocent. He remained hopeful and helpful at all times similar to Pi in Life of Pi. From the beer that he finagled for the prisoners on that hot Summer day, books in the library that he requested and received and the assistance that he provided during tax time, he was definitely more than meets the eye. You honestly don't really expect the ending at all. I didn't really think he'd have that in him. This is a King film though so you know there will be unexpected plot twists.The setting completely made the movie. A drab prison in a remote location, a smelly sewage line and absolutely no grab just sets a tone for unpleasantry, seclusion and discontentment. Considering where Andy came from it was a complete contrast and definitely took some getting used to. Even the transformation of the library - an attempt from Andy in seeking normalcy, was completely realistic in that they took a barren prison room and created shelving, a similar dewey decimal system and structure. The costumes also played an important role within the film and worked hand in hand with the setting. All prisoners wear the same type of clothing and style. There are no stand outs. Some items were more worn than others and some just plain didn't fit well depending on the person. He helped to portray an idea of what it would really be like in prison.Ultimately the movie took a case of misfortune and showed based off circumstances, the lengths that someone would go when the odds are against them. The director also showed us that in the most unlikely places how a true friendship can blossom. Never giving up hope, never judging a book by it's cover.	4
 Time and Pressure.	"Keeping this short and sweet, meek Tim Robbins is a convicted accountant who is sent to a real MEAN prison in Maine. The captain of the corrections officers, the massive-jawed Clancy Brown, is quick with his baton, agitato, so to speak. The warden, Bob Gunton, is a corrupt dictator. Morgan Freeman, serving a life sentence, becomes a friend of Robbins. Robbins has a lot in the upper story and goes about doing good for the penitentiary and for the inmates, despite the beatings, attempted rapes, and unjust punishment. Under his management the library becomes a beacon for all prison libraries. Many brutal years pass before Robbins, an amateur geologist, tunnels through the prison wall, hauling a bundle of ill-gotten pelf, crawls into a five-hundred yard long sewer pipe filled with excreta, and splashes through a river to freedom and a tiny coastal village in Mexico, Zijuataneco. I drove there about the time this escape takes place and it really WAS a cheap, peaceful, fishing town with an irregular water supply. Now it's a metropolis. After forty years of imprisonment, Freeman is finally paroled. He joins his friend Robbins in Mexico, where they pursue an honest living as simple fishermen and become lovers for life. (Kidding.) It's a long movie but a gripping one. Movies about prisons are difficult to make. The surroundings are hardly epic, the wardrobe drab, the inmates participate in what the sociologist Erving Goffman called ""the small rewards"" system common to all total institutions -- gifts and trades of items like cigarettes and harmonicas. The inmates have humble jobs, nothing exciting about working in a laundry. No women. Threats and occasional fist fights but no open warfare. And here there's not even the suspense of watching men prepare for an escape. How do you fold these conditions together and come up with a story? The people who produced ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have managed to pull it off, and without directorial display -- no fireworks, no instant cutting, no screechy metallic noise on the sound track, no razzle dazzle whatever, just classic movie making. The success of the film is helped ENORMOUSLY by Morgan Freeman's performance as the friend of Robbins. He's an exceptional actor, and though we may see him now mostly in the role of mentor, his early performances as a heavy shouldn't be ignored. God, he was one charming and terrifying pimp in ""Street Smart."" Robbins does a good job too, although his role requires him to be subdued. It also requires him to be saintly, alas. There's nothing wrong with him. He's a genius, doing everybody's tax returns. He's more sinned against than sinning. Cool Hand Luke at least was reckless and expedient and brought the storm down upon himself. And Luke's guards would have made mincemeat out of Robbins. Robbins' prison is a kind of fantasy land in which he can at will commandeer an office, lock the doors, and play a record of an opera over all the loudspeakers. It's also a pipe dream to believe that all of the inmates would stop what they're doing and stare in wonder at the loudspeakers broadcasting two ladies singing in Italian. Slim Whitman, maybe. But Joan Sutherland? They would have booed. Nor would inmates show the kind of solidarity on display here, once Robbins pulls them together. The coolest presentation of self in an institution like this is utter indifference, except for some offense against the honor of one's self or one's gang. It's a cold-hearted place in which practically nobody applauds when someone else succeeds.However, put all the fantasy aside and accept it for what it is, a fictional tale of men who pay dearly for misdeeds and ultimately save themselves and undermine the foundation of corrupt society. Not heroically, just by sheer persistence."	7
 Not Really Impressed	I have seen Shawshank Redemption for more than 10 times and being a critic i have noticed couple of things that really make the movie little dull and listless.It is not to say that the movie is not good. It is pretty good, with all the technical merits - But it doesn't merit a ranking of 9.3 at all. Which is why you can see i rated it pretty low, as compare to God father or God father 2.One of the factors affecting my rating is the speed of the movie and the plot,it is little diverted and you are not quite sure to understand what the guy is up to. Though curiosity is pretty good in any movie, but this time around curiosity has killed the cat and made the movie little boring.So in my opinion, Shaw shank Redemption is good but not GREAT.	2
 This movie will blow your mind	This movie is in so much depth.this is the best and will be the best movie of all time.The direction , the acting and the way music was played and how slowly the suspense was build throws light upon why this is ranked 1 in IMDb list.Remember, Red, hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies. I will be hoping that this letter finds you, and finds you well.Get busy living, or get busy dying.These quotes are so damn good.Andy: Here's where it makes the most sense. You need it so you don't forget. Forget that there are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. That there's a – there's a – there's something inside that's yours, that they can't touch.	10
 Powerful, poignant and thought-provoking.	So, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Where do I start? The 1994 prison drama based on the Steven King novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', from his 1982 collection 'Different Seasons'. Andy Dufresne, a banker from Maine, is convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve a life sentence. There, he meets Red, a prisoner who smuggles items from the outside world. Andy, who had been an amateur geologist before being jailed, asks Red to get him a rock hammer for shaping rocks he collects from the exercise yard into small sculptures. One of the next items he orders from Red is a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the ensuing years, Andy regularly requests more posters from Red, including pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. When asked, Andy tells Red that he likes to imagine he can step through the pictures and be with the actresses. So now you've got a basic overview; let's get into the protagonist and of this fictional prison tale - Andy Dufresnse. As previously stated, Andy is a banker from Maine. At first sight Andy comes across an icy and cold man, whilst in the court room; causing the viewer to lean towards deeming him guilty, rather than innocent. The saying 'Never judge a book by its cover' springs to mind in this instance. We find out Andy is a well educated and extremely crafty gentleman because of his ability to sculpt small rocks with a rock hammer, and his knack for self-education through reading books.A pivotal character in this films plot is Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding; of whom interestingly - is of Irish heritage; hence the last name 'Redding'. As you may have picked up his nickname is'Red and it is a play on words ofhis last name. He was sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine in 1927, because he planned and carried out his wife's murder by disabling her brakes which accidentally killed a neighbour and child as well, which earned him a life sentence at Shawshank Prison. In the film he is known as the 'guy who can get things' as he regularly smuggles many items into the prison with help from others. Also, a very craft and intelligent man.It is also an incredibly moving story, which makes you ponder what it'd be like to feel as trapped as the prisoners, and to feel the desperation they would have. Not to ruin the plot completely but 'Red' described himself as 'institutionalised', which made him feel like he'd struggle to exist outside the walls of Shawshank. To me, It's a powerful, poignant and thought-provoking film like no other; which truly has the ability to alter your outlook on life, and I believe it could change it in a positive way as it teaches you to be grateful for the life you have, as some others are much worse off than you are. I also admire the attention given to the story, which no other movie that I have watched has quite done. And that is why I consider it as one of my all-time favourites.	10
 Class, Directorial Excellence.	Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances. This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature. Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. Simply marvelous entertainment. A passing reference to 'The Count of Monte Cristo' offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling.Spiritually moving old-fashioned prison picture.	10
 A must watch		10
 Goodbye Shawshank	Actually Shawshank is one of the best movies I have seen in the American theater it is a complete movie what is meant by the word beautiful photography, exquisite story, crew influential representation. Is a film directed and written creator Frank Darapont It is the movie that I recommend every one to see it, this movie can change your life and stick in your memory forever. It is the one who deserves our praise and analysis, viewing and also return, in fact it is more than just a movie. Tells us a written novel by Stephen King and talk about Andy Dufferin and who was working as a banker brilliant, then discovers one day his wife betrayed him with another man, he is accused of killing her and thrown in jail for life. Then spin most of the events of the film there, the prison forthcoming .. Shawshank Prison.	10
 Best	"One of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.He shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years."	8
 Not anything special	i've been seeing this movie as the number one everywhere but I personally don't think it deserves a 9.3 or the best titles in the world. I think it's very average. Morgan Freeman is good in every movie. I loved his acting here as well. the movie has a good story overall and i loved the ending and the philosophy. Although i watched it a long time ago, i cant remember all of it. i will try to watch it once more to refresh my memory and hopefully i can come up with something good to write about this movie. or maybe it's my choice of genre. i would personally rate this movie a 7.5 out of 10 and definitely not a 9 or a 10. thank you :)	7
" The ""smart"" movie for people with simple tastes"	"This is the film that seems to make people excited that they can tell other film-lovers that they like, because it seems sophisticated. With it's captivating title and the feel-good story of friendship, it's about as complicated as most American movie-goers can get. This can be a decent one to keep on, if you switch to it on TV and have some laundry to fold. However, there are hundreds of films I'd rather watch to stimulate my mind. I would have said thousands but I've only seen slightly over a thousand films so far. I know that many people have a special place for this film in their heart, but they never really seem to stop and ask themselves ""why?"". Shawshank does have a few, fun gotcha-type moments, and the shot of Andy in the stream after escape is quite memorable. However, the film itself is not one of those birds whose feathers are too bright that ""are not meant to be caged."" This film needs to stay shelved when we are discussing the greats. It can find itself comfortably and appropriately filed between Shallow Hal and Shiloh."	6
 One of the best endings of all times! Simply wow!	"I am at a loss of words to describe the greatness of this film, and by all means I give full credit to the book that it is an adaptation of.Half way through the film I began to enjoy the capabilities of the man and begin to see all that as the point of the film, but then it slows down in pace a bit (for the final ""assault"") and I end up asking myself the purpose of it all, but then the ending leaves me speechless!This film, alongside the Bollywood biopic 'Manjhi - The Mountain Man' (2015), are two great examples of the fact how time is of little value when there are no better alternatives to achieve your goal. Often in our life we deny to take certain steps which might help us in achieving a goal in some years, but exactly after spending as much time sitting mum, we reflect on the time spent and regret not having taken those steps in all these years.A maternal cousin of mine from Denmark visited us in the summer of 2012 and he mentioned this film in a lot of conversation. Sadly, I wasn't too much into Hollywood films yet. Now that I am since over 15 months I checked the IMDb list of top 250 films and found this on the first place. I was immediately reminded of my cousin and thought that he wasn't after all just randomly naming a film. It was very clever to have shown Andy as innocent. This makes the viewers get more engaged into his suffering in the prison. The scene where he goes to his room with the rope, you almost find yourself saying in heart how this will be great injustice and something very, very sad and depressing.Again, all in all, this film is out of this world. One of the best of all times."	10
 This movie is overrated .	This movie is not bad , but i think it's overrated because there is too many movies that are better than this one , it's not even the best one in 1994, as we have Satantango, Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump ! .. and its like i wanna go in the details more and more and the movie stayed not deep enough , so there is a lot of stories that deserves talking about it! ,, its not only about how to escape ! i don't want a movie like that ! ,, arts are better than fun , and if there is no art there is no fun ! so it doesn't deserve the first place in this list ! its overrated ! ,, and i hope from other users to watch a lot of movies so they can judge in equal way!	7
 Great Film!	So many great things to say about this film. Very Touching story and will definitely be remembered as a classic. Another Timeless movie to add to the list. It really shows how dynamic all of the characters become throughout the film. Morgan Freeman's monologue is outstanding and is one of my favorite movie monologue's. The character Andy Dufrain is the most dynamic character of all. I would put this movie on the top of my list. I've seen it several times and have it on DVD. I also love the screenplay music is very inspirational, calm , and relaxing and gives a sense of serenity. The time setting is done perfectly it really brings you back to the time of the movie in which it is set. I would advise everyone to see this film and the persecution Andy Dufrain goes through.	10

 .	think every generation has their films that they can relate to. My generation related to films like Breakfast Club, Pretty In Pink and Fasstimes at Ridgemont High. Not to say that these films cannot make an impression on today's youth, because I'm sure that they can, but they were definitely films that appealed to kids my age in the 80's. Napolean Dynamite is a film that, in my opinion, is much more of a film that appeals to today's youth. Napolean is a slacker and just wants to be left alone. He has his circle of friends but for the most part, as the poster says, he is out to prove that he has nothing to prove. The film is humorous in some parts, pedestrian in others and overall it is a film that for someone like me ( 33 years old ), it probably doesn't work as well as it does for someone who is in high school. I know many kids that enjoyed this film and most of it was because of Jon Heder. He embodies the very spirit of Napolean Dynamite and even though I found the film to quite average, I have to admit that even I enjoyed Heder's performance. He obviously has a bright future ahead of him with a total of 7 films to his credit in the next two years.	7
 My Brief opinion on a cult classic	One of my favourite films, at first it was shocking, different and I was on the edge of my seat watching what would come around next. With the cast and filmography all working in harmony and the storyline telling a truly human story. The progression of the story from start to finish is brilliant and how the events unfold scene by scene with the heart of the story being about friendship and Hope surviving the most soul crushing situations. To build something in the confines of walls designed to take your life without actually killing you. This still is an amazing piece of cinema and I know that if they try to re make this film in the years to come the original will always be number one.	8

 The best movie of all time		10
 8;57	"great.....movie nice The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the most brilliant movies I have ever seen. Similar to The Green Mile in many respects (and better than it in almost all of them), these two movies have shown us that Stephen King is a master not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the heart. The plot is average, but King did great things with it in his novella that are only furthered by the direction, and the acting is so top-rate it's almost scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 years for the murder of his wife. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively evil and frightening as Warden Norton, and there are great performances and cameos all around; the most prominent one being Gil Bellows (late as Billy of Ally McBeal) as Tommy, a fellow inmate of Andy's who suffers under the iron will of Norton.If you haven't seen this movie, GO AND RENT IT NOW. You will not be disappointed. It is positively the best movie of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all time. This movie is a spectacle to move the mind, soul, and heart. 10/10"	4
 Review for The Shawshank Redemption	Simply amazing and heart touching movie. End of movie is extremely good. Acting I will rate 10/10 to all the cast. Direction 9.5. Story 10. Screenplay 9. Action is not much in movie. Songs I didn't liked. Cameraman 9. Editor 9.5. Story: Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover and is sentenced to a tough prison. However, only Andy knows he didn't commit the crimes. While there, he forms a friendship with Red (Morgan Freeman), experiences brutality of prison life, adapts, helps the warden, etc., all in 19 years.Wrongly convicted, Andy Dufresne (Robbins) is sentenced to two consecutive life terms in in Maine's Shawshank prison for the murders of his wife and her lover.	9
 Great movie	"One of the best movies ever . Great story .Morgan Freeman was great . After opening on 33 screens with take of $727,327, the $25M film fell fast from theatres and finished with a mere $28.3M. The reasons for failure are many. Firstly, the title is a clunker. While iconic to fans today, in 1994, people knew not and cared not what a 'Shawshank' was. On the DVD, Tim Robbins laughs recounting fans congratulating him on ""that 'Rickshaw' movie."" Marketing-wise, the film's a nightmare, as 'prison drama' is a tough sell to women, and the story of love between two best friends doesn't spell winner to men. Worst of all, the movie is slow as molasses. As Desson Thomson writes for the Washington Post, ""it wanders down subplots at every opportunity and ignores an abundance of narrative exit points before settling on its finale."" But it is these same weaknesses that make the film so strong."	10
 The best film there is, an must for movie lovers.		10

 best of history	I decided to watch this movie when I saw it on the top of IMDb list. and even tho there are many great movies this is kind of movie which would be liked by majority of the world. This is an amazing story about a man during his long-term imprisonment. Morgan Freeman is undoubtedly a great actor and we find him as a supporting actor has been really trendy culture in the modern cinema.The movie has a really great plot, full of interesting dialogues you need to pause if you blink your eye. It really sticks to your chair.I think this is my favorite movie so far as well. I just gave 9 out of 10 because I hardly give 10/10 to anything in my life cuz there is always room for improvement.	9
 great just great	Christopher Nolan brings yet another adrenaline-filled, comic-inspired movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well. When crisis threatens Gotham City, Bruce Wayne jumps back into the Batmobile to fight crime. Batman is joined on his quest by an eager orphaned cop (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a seductive cat burglar (Anne Hathaway), and a violent masked villain (Tom Hardy). This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. Nolan used actors that had either appeared in previous Batman films or in his blockbuster hit Inception, and all of them shone in their respective roles: Tom Hardy was almost unrecognizable in his Bane costume, while Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Marion Cotillard were both excellent—and obviously comfortable with Nolan's directing style and the film's dramatic tone.	7
 Proof that box office takings aren't everything.	When I heard that this movie bombed at the box office during its theatrical run, I was very surprised as this is simply an all time classic. Rarely is narration in a movie been done as well as this, Morgan Freeman simply becomes Ellis Redding whose depiction of a hardened con who has accepted that he may never get out and goes through his parole hearings not caring about the outcome. Tim Robbins becomes Andy Dufresne and his portrayal of a man who is really out of his depth and his element, and finding adjusting to life on the inside difficult, almost impossible. The changing relationship between the two characters from initial hostility to deep almost brother like friendship is captivating. Clancy Brown's depiction of the tyrannical Captain Baron Hadley is amazing and likewise Bob Gunton as the hypocritical bible bashing, Warden Norton. The other characters like wise are also well done, especially Brooks and sadistic inmate Boggs. The depiction is what you'd expect from a prison movie and while depicting a life of boring monotony and routine show occasionally punctuated by brief moments of excitement is still fascinating thanks to the soundtrack and of course Morgan Freeman's narration, and I don't want to spoil the ending but it climaxes perfectly with not a dry eye in sight, thanks to the pacing, and the dialogue can't be faulted. Now in regard to the differences from the book, these are for the most part minor and if anything enhance the story rather than hinder it, a rarity. In summary this is a must watch for all movie lovers.	10
 Solid Film	"The Shawshank Redemption is a fine and heartwarming tale that holds up after over 20 years. The film is about a man named Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins) who is sentenced to prison after it is ruled he killed his wife. In my mind, The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best ""feel good"" movies because it is not afraid to present darker themes (suicide, rape, corruption, etc.) and explore the brutality of prison life. But by presenting such a low for the main characters, the audience feels more when the heroes succeed in the end. I feel that Andy is a character most people can empathize, which is critical for a movie of this type. In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption is a solid film that leaves a good feeling with the viewer, even after the credits roll."	6
 just saw it for the 7th time !!	The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.This film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.	9
 Like the style of this movie very much, and the profound meaning of education.	"The shaw shank redemption is undoubtedly a good film, no movement, no special effects, even no beauty, but still can impress the audience, and after more than ten years and charm. It depend on what attracted us? Some say because it reflects the toughness of the ""human nature"". Indeed, with a small hammer, nearly 20 years, the personal control is very strict fascist prison, unearthed a small escape tunnel (perhaps call hew to knock a small tunnel is more suitable, the hammer is too small). Isn't this resilience reflects the people? But I think the plot is dramatic obviously, this is just a director in the arrangement of the plot, at the end of this just in order to reflect the ""self-salvation"" Andy finally succeeded, otherwise the whole plot and theme. So some people think that, ""the shaw shank redemption"" reflect is actually ""hope"" is how valuable to the people. Yes, the film directly when it comes to have lots of hope. Such as Andy escaped prison after letter to Rhetta said: ""Remember, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing (dies."" Maybe that's what works and director want to tell us. ""Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free."" This sentence has become a famous. To me, ""the shaw shank redemption"" touched my place not only on this. Tell me about my ideas about the characters in the film first. A shark fort prison, the prisoners inside and officials, seems to be that our society. High above the warden NORTON, at ordinary times, on the lines, such as the bible actually gain by hook or by crook, cruel and cunning and greed. Guards long Haley and other officers, and vicious brutality, ACTS as NORTON's thugs, grass Jan the prisoner's life. They are like a power class in our reality? I call it a shark fort ruler of the ""small society"". There are different in the prisoners. Besides the protagonist Andy, Rhetta (Morgan Freeman) is a key figure, of course, I think he is a clue of the film: in fact, the whole movie dialogue is not much, in the film a lot of want to show the things is by Rhetta monologue, which were mostly Rhetta to shaw shank life reflection to summarize and his interpretation of Andy. Rhett is a wise man, and he in shark fort mix very well, make the demand of people he was less than ""no"". His wisdom and insight into the shark fort the essence of life, he said to Andy: ""the shark fort, hope is a dangerous thing"", this is the wise man's tongue. In my environment, people will say ""Rhetta comrade very sophisticated,"" at such a time. However, and the reality of the so-called ""wise men"", although Rhetta see see through the essence of the shark fort, but he didn't want to fight in the past, not to mention influence and change others, he is only conform to the rules in order to protect themselves in the shaw shank. Until Andy appear, changed his, and eventually lead him to the freedom of the other shore."	9
 Awesome Movie -Must watch.	"According to me this movie is one of the best movies i have ever come across till my 21st birthday,till date. It is one of the remarkable works in direction,acting and arts. The movie goes with a flow of thriller and suspense.....maintaining the patience of the protagonist ,also it entertains with a touch of humor and stupid fights! The movie makes a mark that anything can be achieved if done by heart. It is a sheer masterpiece to portray that Where there is a will ,there is a way ! The movie also sets a freedom which each human has in his own mind but he cannot set himself free from his tensions,etc. Yet , it can be done with true hard work,dedication and focus !Cheers to the ""Shawshank Redemption"" Team ! Peace. :)"	9

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my opinion.	10
 You Keep Me Hoping	"A great film to watch anytime because it moves you every time you watch as it depicts friendship, hope and redemption. The friendship between the characters Andy and Red is amazing. An awesome movie which I watch whenever I feel low. It fills me with some hope to believe that everything will be alright as Andy says ""Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."" Would have won Oscar if it wouldn't have been made in the year 1994. People remember Forrest Gump which bagged the Oscar that year as a good film, but this movie remains as one of the all-time best movies in history. It has been two decades since this movie released and still this movie stands at Number 1 among the IMDb ratings and that shows it all."	10

 Obstinacy	This movie is a classic of the 90s, full of violence and excitement in the search for freedom at any cost, by the protagonist. The storyline takes place mostly during the stay in prison of the character from the beginning, does not conform to the unjust confinement. During frame the character makes several friends but also suffer violence at the hands of rivals In a relentless search for his release with the help of his friends during a storm of nature at night, manages to escape from prison and win his dreamed freedom. I really recommend you to watch at this movie if you like a exciting drama movies. Tip: this movie is available on Netflix.	9
 One of the Best Movies of 1990s	One of the most beautiful and well directed and produced movies I have ever seen in 1990s Movie Series,Morgan Freeman played so nice and professional in this one like others that he used to play a rule. personally Speaking this Movies wanted to explain the real friendship and Loyalty between two persons or simply two friends and because of this these kinds of features made the movie more acceptable and worth watching it for that long running time,and Also good to talk about wonderful rule that Mr.Tim Robbins played in this Movies but Overall this one contains superstars and also A well known French director Mr.Frank Darabont so we convinced Why this movie got the Rate of 9.3/10 From almost 1.5 Million Users in IMDb only and I can surly say Movie Lovers have watched this Wonderful Opus in their Watch List.	8
 Breathtaking Prison movie! one of my best	Im not going to write a massive review as so many people have already told you everything you need to know about this amazing film.I will however say 3 things that make it my favourite film.1, I have yet to find a film that matches this for inspiring Hope, Dreams and Friendship.2, Shawshank Redemption is Stephen King at his best.3, Even if you don't usually like prison films this one will be the exception.These three points are the reason why Shawshank Redemption is my comfort blanket and will always be my go to film..	9
 Three words-It touches you!!	"HOPE!-A very powerful word that incites sense of faith is the main theme of the movie. That coupled with friendship gives us this amazing movie which is just too good to watch. There's a reason why it has been at the very top since decades.It's because it touches the human part of you. Frank Darabont did an excellent justice to this movie.There is nary a word or scene out of place in the entire thing.It's an adaptation of Stephen King's novel. The characters are brilliantly cast.Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. There's a part of you which wants to see him accomplish this.The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman, in probably his best role) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank and the stories that unfold with that quest. If you haven't seen this movie until now, go watch it,you won't be disappointed."	9
 A Best Story	"This movie is a must watch movie. I bet everyone loved this movie for sure. Acting is superb.The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."	
 Great film based on a classic novel.	Directed by Frank Darabont, this film ticks all the boxes of what excellent films are all about. It encompasses the reality of a prison thriving on corruption among its operators as Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the protagonist, struggles to serve a sentence wrongfully imposed on him. It seems the only thing helping him survive the harsh reality of prison is fellow inmate Red (Morgan Freeman) with whom he forms a special friendship. Life for Andy in a tough prison is set to last him all his life. If you're looking for a movie that will take you on an emotional roller coaster, or a tear-jerker, then this is the film for you. Great cast, excellent story-line and perfect acting. It's based on the novel written by renowned author Stephen King. So get your tissue boxes out and ice-cream because this movie is emotionally draining. Great film, 9/10. Really.	9
 One of the best movie that i watched.	This movie is watching worthwhile. You cannot just predict about whats going on. Really fascinating movie. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was outstanding. It's like I was present with them all the way. The way this movie was started and till the very end it was marvelous. I have to mansion about the dialogues used in this movie that they were truly inspiring. This movie made me think about life. Surely it can inspire ones life and can lead to greatness. Yes, it was one of the best movie that i have ever seen. Direction was quite well and cast were more then perfect. The character for Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman suits them most and I think no one can do better then them :)	9
 The best and most realistic drama film i've seen in ages.		10
 Master piece		10
 Best Prison Movies of all time		10
 One of the greats!	This film adaption of Steven King's short story is a masterpiece. It's one of those movies that I am compelled to watch every time it's on TV, and that's often. Andy finds himself in prison for a murdering his cheating wife, a crime he did not commit. Some of the prisoners place bets on his chances of survival right away. But they soon find out that Andy is tougher than he appears. In the darkest of places, Andy's light finds a way to shine. He will not allow his human spirit to be imprisoned. The corrupt warden exploits Andy's financial knowledge and has Andy help him to extort money and hide it. Andy helps him, but grudgingly. At the end of the movies the viewer is delighted by Andy's ingenious escape as he makes his way through hundreds of yards of muck only to waltz out of town with all of the warden's money. Andy's friendship with Red adds to the touching story, as Red, upon his release, makes his way to his friend Andy as he lives out his life in the beauty of a Mexican beach.This story is timeless and beautiful. Tim Robins and Morgan Freeman play their parts perfectly. This movie has so many amazing moments that it's impossible list them all. This is a must-see movie.	
 cinema at its best	I think this has been one of the finest movies ever made. I thought cinema in all it grandeur. Frank Darabont needs to be applauded for his direction. You can judge the finesse of the director by the perfection he shows to capture the smallest details in a movie. All the actors involved from small to lead roles have done a tremendous job in their portrayal. The film is riveting and gripping. It does require you to be patient as the build up of the characters takes some time. but once the story moves forward it captures you and you are mesmerized by the story and it builds a connection. I have watched this movie couple of times and can surely say that you will watch again its just that sort of a movie. This one is a must watch.	10
 What can I say about this life changing , gathering and extraordinary movie?	"The first time I watched this movie everything was dark and unsolved for me because I didn't get the main message of the movie, the message that Frank Darabont was trying to extend between us ""Humans"".So I watched it ten more times and that was when I realised My life has been changed.Even that I knew every single dialogue from the movie and all I did was to liken the movie to my life. likening prison , likening the people and likening the freedom. Now I will just write 10 words so that next time you're watching the movie , you will focus more on it. Prison , Enemies , Music , Thinking Aloud , Hope , Hope , Hope , Hope , Hope and Hope. The first thing that I will show my children is The Shawshank Redemption before any shitty pipe animations and cartoons.Thank you Hamed/2015"	10
 One of the Top 100 Movies of All time	No matter what I'm doing, if Shawshank Redemption is on; I have to drop everything and watch it. It's one of those films that grabs hold of you and never let's you go and will haunt you long after the credits role. The entire cast was superb lead by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Their friendship chemistry on screen was palpable, rich and sweet. Beautiful to watch. And let's not forget the wonderful adaptation from Stephen King's short story. Frank Darabont is a filmmaker I respect and admire and he gets it right were other King filmmakers sadly fail. If you have not seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it as soon as possible. You will not soon forget it.	10
 amazing	The Shawshank Redemptionabsolutely amazing movie its a must see if u haven't seen it already i could not take my eyes away from the screen i was scared to go to toilet in case i missed anything Morgan freeman played his part to perfection as did Tim Robbins i would recommend anyone to watch this if they have not done already hard to believe this was 1994. a simple prison movie based on hope, friendship and redemption. a fantastic movie that touches the soul of so many people. if (and that is a big if) you do not like this movie then i will be absolutely shocked and surprised. i have rated it a ten out of ten because i think this movie is by far one of the best i have watched to date (2015).So people watch it take in every second of the movie and most of all ENJOY!!!!!!	10
 A classic piece of unforgettable film-making.		8
 Amazing - Best Film of the 90's	Im not going to write a massive review as so many people have already told you everything you need to know about this amazing film.I will however say 3 things that make it my favourite film.1, I have yet to find a film that matches this for inspiring Hope, Dreams and Friendship.2, Shawshank Redemption is Stephen King at his best.3, Even if you don't usually like prison films this one will be the exception.These three points are the reason why Shawshank Redemption is my comfort blanket and will always be my go to film	9
 A captivating, well made film.	I first watched it when I was 10 years old, and my mind immediately discarded it, but once I started to watch films for what they represent, I can honestly say that this film has all the qualities a great film will have: Great screen writing, great actors, a great director, a captivating story and a plot that swings you towards a great end.This film represents what the whole film industry now a days has at times forgotten: You don't have to make a saga of films for people to remember your work, all you need is a great story that, despite being so complex, explains itself during the whole film, and doesn't need to be 3 or 4 hours long for you to understand the characters or empathize with the situations.All in all this film will forever be the perfect example of how any film should be made, in order for it to be remembered.	9
 Deserves to be ranked #1	This movie has the one thing every great movie has, and that is that the movie is tied together and all the details conform into one great story at the end. Don't get me wrong the movie was great through every scene (especially small details, like how Red sees 'Brooks was here' carved into the ceiling of the room Brooks hangs himself in), but the moment you think you'll see Andy hanging lifeless from his cell you find out that he has escaped Shawshank. In the next moments while watching you start to realize that from the first day Andy talked to Red about the pick hammer, he already has his plan in mind. And even though it seems as if Andy wants the poster of the actress while watching the film for his own pleasure, he actually used it to cover up the tunnel he dug during the years he was in Shawshank. Andy's calm demeanor when under pressure from the warden and the guards causes him to slip under their eye and dig the tunnel to escape Shawshank. That's why this is my favorite movie of all time, because the conclusion makes you realize things that were going on throughout the story that no other movie ending can even come close to how the Shawshank Redemption ends.	10
 A masterpiece! Nothing else to say...	I have to thank to the director, actors, screen players and the other people who made this film. -Morgan Freeman is a genius of the cinematography and stars only in very beautiful pictures. -Tim Robins plays one of the most loved characters ever. -Frank Darabont made his best film. -The storyline is one of the most interesting that I've ever seen. One of my favorite movies ever! I'm happy that this film is in top 10 but i consider that there are other films who deserve to be no. 1, but I still love this picture! I hope next generations will love this film the same way I do. Continue to make gorgeous pictures! Best wishes! B-)	10
 Top 250	"This is a great movie I agree with it but the 1st place should be taken from other titles like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction or Apocalypse Now for example. Those films changed for some reason the way people look at the cinema nowadays. Take Pulp Fiction for example, Tarantino have created a whole universe with their movies, all the stories are connected in some way, he created cigarettes and hamburger brands that he use in all his movies, the fact that ""The Bride""(Kill Bill) is just a character played by ""Mia Wallace""(Pulp Fiction) and by the same actress(Uma Thurman). These layers, make a movie get pass by generations and still get the ""thing"" in your head every time you see it. I could talk about some other movie or director that deserve the 1st place more than this on but I have chose this example and I would like to know your opinion about it.Thanks,"	8
 Superb movie ! classic ! #Twisty Must watch !		10
 Everything you didn't know a movie should be	"This is an excellent movie. Its content is intellectual and touching. I would recommend every one to watch Shawshank Redemtion. I ended up getting feelings I didn't know I had, and it can actually be too much for a delicate soul like mine. It has everything you didn't know a movie should have, and will certainly change your state of mind for a while. I have close to nothing bad to say about this movie, it is as close to perfect as it can be. I kind of got the feeling that ""I will never accomplish such an amazing piece of film in my lifetime"", and that the writers and of course actors in Shawshank Redemtion are unbelievable. Now watch it."	10

 The Shwashank Redemption Review	"I extremely recommend for the people who is a fan movies, The Best of The Best movies of all the Times!My first impression before watch the movie it was like"" This seems pretty bad movie, just for the photo"" but then my uncle/Godfather told me to watch, in the begin it was a little stopped the movie but then i start to enjoy , and the end is the best thing because he is very intelligent at the point he dig a hole through the wall , and put a post, and help the chief of the prison with the finances.I have watch this movie like 4 times! In a scale of 0/10 i would give 100!"	10
 Redemption at its best	Shawshank redemption- an absolute blinder. A movie that sets a perfect benchmark for all the movie makers. A movie that can be watched again and again and still it makes your heart pump. Truly a 10 star movie.Direction 10 out of 10, background score 10 out of 10, acting speechless. We rarely find a movie that has a perfect star cast and every actor outnumbers the counterpart. Morgan freeman truly legendary actor. These are the movies that not only deserve awards but also some special position in Cinemas history. Hope is the biggest weapon for any man to achieve something in life. Shawshank redemption proves these lines that Hope is the biggest thing in life.	10
 Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.	"With a legion of titles like Pet Sematary, Firewalker, Sleepwalkers, Maximum Overdrive, and Children of the Corn, it's reasonable not to expect much from Stephen King-inspired motion pictures. Adaptations of the prolific author's work typically vary from mildly entertaining to virtually unwatchable. There are a few notable exceptions, however; two of which Stand by Me, Misery were crafted by widely-respected director Rob Reiner. While The Shawshank Redemption is not a Reiner movie per Se, it is a production of Castle Rock Pictures Reiner's film company, and ranks among the best filmed versions of any King stories to date. This statement has not changed since I first wrote it in 1994.Spanning the years from 1947 through 1966, The Shawshank Redemption takes the ""innocent man in prison"" theme and bends it at a different angle. Instead of focusing on crusades for freedom, the movie ventures down a less-traveled road, concentrating on the personal cost of adapting to prison life and how some convicts, once they conform, lose the ability to survive beyond the barbed wire and iron bars. As one of the characters puts it: ""These prison walls are funny. First you hate them, then you get used to them, then you start to depend on them.""Filmed on location in a disused Ohio prison, The Shawshank Redemption is set in a place of perpetual dreariness. What little color there is, is drab and lifeless lots of grays and muted greens and blues, and there are times when the film is a shade away from black-and-white give credit to cinematographer Roger Deakins, a longtime Cohen brothers collaborator. It's ironic, therefore, that the central messages are of hope, redemption, and salvation.First time feature director Frank Darabont helms a fleet of impressive performances. Tim Robbins, as Andrew Dufresne, plays the wrongly convicted man with quiet dignity. Andy's ire is internal; he doesn't rant about his situation or the corruptness of the system that has imprisoned him. His unwillingness to surrender hope wins him the admiration of some and the contempt of others, and allows the audience to identify with him that much more strongly.Ellis Boyd Redding Morgan Freeman, or ""Red"" as his friends call him, is the self-proclaimed ""Sears and Roebuck"" of the Shawshank Prison for a price, he can get just about anything from the outside. His is the narrative voice and, for once, the disembodied words aid, rather than intrude upon, the story. Serving a life sentence for murder, Red is a mixture of cynicism and sincerity - a man with a good soul who has done a vile deed. His friendship with Andy is one of The Shawshank Redemption's highlights.William Sadler (as a fellow prisoner), Clancy Brown as a sadistic guard, and Bob Gunton as the corrupt warden all give fine supporting performances. Newcomer Gil Bellows, in a small but crucial role that was originally intended for Brad Pitt, brings the poise of a veteran to his portrayal of Tommy Williams, Andy's protégé.Ultimately, the standout actor is the venerable James Whitmore, doing his finest work in years. Whitmore's Brooks is a brilliantly realized character, and the scenes with him attempting to cope with life outside of Shawshank represents one of the film's most moving - and effective - sequences.Unfortunately, following a solid two hours of thought-provoking drama, the movie deflates like a punctured balloon during its overlong denouement. The too-predictable final twenty minutes move a little slowly, and writer/director Darabont exposes a distressing need to wrap up everything into a tidy little package.""Salvation lies within,"" advises Warden Norton at one point. It is the presentation of this theme that makes The Shawshank Redemption unique. Prison movies often focus on the violence and hopelessness of a life behind bars. While this film includes those elements, it makes them peripheral. The Shawshank Redemption is all about hope and, because of that, watching it is both uplifting and cathartic."	9
 Good film	I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope. Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going through.It is a simple film, yet it has an everlasting message. Frank Darabont didn't need to put any kind of outlandish special effects to get us to love this film, the narration and the acting does that for him. Why this movie didn't win all seven Oscars is beyond me, but don't let that sway you to not see this film, let its ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list sway you, let your friends recommendation about the movie sway you.Set aside a little over two hours tonight and rent this movie. You will finally understand what everyone is talking about and you will understand why this is my all time favorite movie.	
 Suresh Actor		
 Welcome to Shawshank	"Probably Stephen King's best adaptation ever. Of the kind to make have a change of mind those who consider King as a minor writer only good to work in the horror. Having seen this movie and then ""The Green Mile"" and ""The mist"", one thing's for sure : Frank Darabont should be the only one authorized to turn Stephen King's writings into movies. I regret that this magnificent movie received no Oscar, in spite of its nominations numerous. The Oscar of best actor for Morgan Freeman, best score for Thomas Newman and best cinematography for Roger Deakins would not have been stolen. I would have also awarded Bob Gunton as best actor in a supporting role"	10
 Just fabulous	"This movie is so inspiring and will never get old, like the saying ""Old and Gold"", it will be forever be watched now and after 20 years, they won't and can't do a movie like this. When i was a kid, and my father showed me this movie, i actually didn't understood it(i was 12 years old but still), when i grew up(i did forgot about the movie), i was searching for a film like this, i just couldn't remember the name of it or who's playing in. I found it again by mistake, and had a deja-vu, i was like, hmm I'm pretty sure i saw this movie(after watching the trailer), first thing what came in my head was the name of my father when i looked at the trailer, then i knew it, its the movie that i couldn't understand when i was little. I saw it, now understood it, and began to laugh for a bit cause i remembered how my father tried to explain me and i didn't understood it. This movie will be always nr1 for me, and I'm pretty sure out there are many others who things the same. Respect and Love for this ""Golden Movie""."	9
 Great	Great movie i have ever seen. When i was see this 1st seen of this movie i really excited to watch movie. From the starting of the film movie goes bigger and bigger so all you enjoy this movie so please watch this movie thank you. Great movie i have ever seen.

 The most... in all regards.		10
 Freaking amazing	i was skeptic at first, cause i don't really like these kind of movies, but i had to give it a try, because of the #1 thing. believe it or not, it took me 3 months, to finally watch it, and my exact thoughts were just get it over with, and i did. and let me just say this changed my whole perspective about these kind of movies, It was the day that i decided to go throw the IMDb Top 250 list, and that was the best decisions i ever made. but this is a review, i have to talk about how i feel about the movie, and if it wasn't so obvious, i simply loved it, i don't have anything to say about the plot and all that shenanigans, this movie is worth your time and your money if you're that kind of person.	10
 One of the best motivational movie ever.		8
 Great film, worth it		8
 Simply a masterpiece	This is surely in top 10 of the movies I've watched. I find almost unbelievable how people can put themselves together in jail and be even more productive than outside the jail, opposite of the expectations. This topic is really interesting, when people are left with nothing but communication with each other and it makes them stronger and give them hope to live the next day. Hope is good, as Andy would say... Filled with phrases to remember, it strongly contributes to the quality and impression of the movie. Robbins and Freeman fantastic, as always. I'm not surprised this is on top of IMDb ranking list, it's a masterpiece. I wouldn't feel sorry watching it several times, it's totally worth it.	10
 Feel good movie!!! (sorry for bad English)	The movie which impressed me to watch dramatic movies a lot.It felt good when the hero escaped from the prison because he never was meant to be inside. But the real part which made me feel very intriguing was to think how much one should have been thinking about freedom that he could make his path out of the prison with just using a rock hammer over so many years.I've even let my parrot to fly high out of his cage who had always been trying to open his cage. TRUE STORY!!!FREEDOM matters!!!Morgan Freeman. He's a man beyond my judgement skills!!!	10
 IMDb Best Movie	The Shawshank Redemption is hands down one for the history books. This movie is based on the friendship of two people (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) in prison.If for some reason you are unfamiliar with this movie I'll give you a basic run-down.A guy is accused of murdering his wife and boyfriend she was cheating on him with. He is sent to jail and makes friends with one guy(Morgan Freeman) he does well and goes in charge of the library and eventually moves to the prison managers bank accountant. A few guys give him trouble and the rest is for you to find out.This film is definitely a must see. (13 years+)9/10- For incredible prison realism, plot line, movie ending.+IMDB no1. Rated movie of all time	9
 A popular one with male sports stars	This film is popular with sports stars. You will find it chosen as the favorite film on sports stars playing cards from Baseball to Hockey to Golf to Rugby League. If you have any sports cards without this listed as a favorite film it's rare! You should probably keep it, encase it in plastic as it would probably be worth something in the not too distant future. It's a film about a guy who is about to die and he talks to Tom Hanks about this. Tom's acting is pretty plastic he morphs into the character like Bruce Lee's water speech. I've seen this on VHS, DVD and MPEG-4. If you have this on any of these I recommend watching them.	5

 Timeless Classic	The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless classic that is compelling material for any adult-age generation.Andy Dufresne is a great leader who's management style is to lead by example. He is the voice of reason in a world of chaos, the source of strength against unsurmountable adversity, the genius among the wicked and witty.Frank Darabont is nothing short of brilliant in his execution of a perfect screenplay, which is eclipsed only by flawless directing and unbeatable casting and acting talent.It doesn't get better than this.	10
 What more can be said...	What more can be said about this movie? There is a reason that it is number one on IMDb...a Website that is a database of every movie ever made...and it is still number 1.When this comes on, no matter what time of the day, I know that I will be sitting and watching til the end. Great actors--I love Robbins and Freeman in this and the supporting actors are just as good , great story--(taken from a great short story)Even after reading the book the story is still exciting to watch unfold on the screen, and just amazingly filmed from start to finish! This is one of my number 1 movies as well!!!	10
 A story about two men who bond over a number of years while imprisoned and learn the value of friendship, hope, and redemption.	This is by far the best film I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. It is a story that consists of friendship, love, hope, and suspense. The entire premise and sub plot is essential and deliberate in making this movie the best. I've cried every time and will continue to the next time I see it. Some scenes bring tears, others are just there to give it better context. It has a great plot twist as well as a climax, neither will be seen coming if you pay attention. My favorite scene is towards the end once Andy has left and Red is struggling with his absence. During his wonderful narration, Red throws excuses to why he is sad, in the end he just misses his friend. Give it a chance, take the time to experience yet enjoy it! I have seen over 700 movies and counting, this kills them all.	10
 Speechless suspense..	"It is a strange comment to make about a film set inside a prison, but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" creates a warm hold on our feelings because it makes us a member of a family. Many movies offer us vicarious experiences and quick, superficial emotions. ""Shawshank"" slows down and looks. It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice remembering the first time he saw Andy (""looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over""), and predicting, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in prison."	9
 I love this movie!!!		10
 A young and successful banker is sentenced to life in prison for a crime he never committed	In 1946, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young and successful banker, has its radically changed life to be put to life in prison for a crime he never committed: the murder of his wife and her lover. So he is sent to a prison that is the nightmare of any detainee: Shawshank State Penitentiary. Andy will be presented to Warden Norton (Bob Gunton) - the corrupt and cruel prison director, and the captain Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) - which treats the prisoners like animals. Andy befriends Ellis Boyd Redding (Morgan Freeman), a prisoner who is serving 20 years and controls the black market in prison. It's a film about friendship, with great acting, showing that friendship can emerge in the most unexpected places.	9
 It Is A Good Movie But It Doesn't Deserves To Be At No.1 At IMDb Top 250	There are much much better movies than this in the universe who can be considered at that position. I saw this movie only because it was at No.1. And truly and very honestly i believe that it is not the right place for this. I found that even the first seasons of Prison Break are much much much better than this movie, and if all four seasons are considered, than this movie wont' stand anywhere near it in excellence, direction, story and almost everything. I think it should be somewhere above 200 or even if it is not in the top 250 list, no problem. And the reviews people are giving for this movie, i am totally surprised, how can they give 10 stars to it...! i mean it matters to me so much.. i watch 80% of the movies after getting its rating from IMDb which should be above 6.5 to qualify for my viewing. So people don't' waste your stars just because its on the top of IMDb 250 movies, its a good movie but not the best, the top position is for the best. Hope to see this one removed from there soon.	6
 One of my all time favorites !!!!!NOT		2
 Briliiant	"I admit it, not being a fan of prison movies and being puzzled by the strange title, at first glance this film wasn't very appealing to me, but it ranks #1 on IMDb and that made me curious. I also admit that at first I was disappointed, the beginning seemed like another Hollywood cliché: man falsely convicted for murder, and it all looked like yet another fight-for-your-proper-rights movie. But after the first half hour I started realising that this is not a prison movie, neither is it a movie about hope or friendship. The background story is irrelevant for the main point of the film and could be exchanged with any other story where someone finds himself in a place of desperation. What is the true beauty of this movie is that it comprises the wisdom of thousands of years of human history, starting with the philosophical school of the ancient Greek and Roman Stoics and Cynisists and leading to the modern work of psychologists like Viktor Frankl. The film even plainly states the message in one scene, where Andy says that the one thing they cant take away from you is the freedom of thought and the freedom to chose your attitude. The first night in prison, Andy does not utter a syllable, although everybody expects him to break down as the apparent wimp he seems to be. Andy truly lives Stoic principles, never loosing it, always ahead of everybody's games. Because he is focused, not trying to change the things he cannot change, like the sadism of the wards or the fact that he most probably never will get parole, but step by step changing the things he can, while being observant of the little tweaks and holes he can exploit to his own advantage. At the end of the movie you realise that he had a plan from day one, and with endurance and focus managed to pull through. Also he never lets go of his guiding principles, which makes him incredibly strong in such a harsh environment. Andy does not simply hope to get released one day, he does everything in his power to regain freedom, and through this attitude creates a leverage so strong that he is even able to crush his enemies in the end. At the end also Red gets it, instead of trying to manipulate the committee into giving him parole by telling them what he thinks they want to hear, he speaks of the only thing he had the power to change, his attitude towards life, and promptly gets released. The topic alone would be sufficient to propel this movie into the top ten of the best films ever made, but it is further enhanced through a captivating story and narrative, wonderful photography, and a superb acting performance of practically every actor involved. Morgan Freeman sticks out for me, because I admittedly have a weak spot for him, but that does not diminish the contribution of the rest of the cast. I guess it will always remain debatable which movie is ""the best"", I think one should not taint the extraordinary contribution of this movie to film history with such petty discussions. Without the slightest doubt this is one of - if not the - best movie(s) I've ever seen."	10
 An amazing accomplishment, but with a serious lack of Jeff Goldblum		4
 Its excellent		10
 over-hyped, but stirring & lovely tale nonetheless		8
 The best movie ever made.	The Shawshank Redemption is one movie, that every person should watch at least once during their lifetime. It's a classic drama/crime movie, which starts in 1946 with Andy Dufresne, a banker being wrongly accused and convicted of his wife's and wife's loves murder. He is sentenced to life at the Shawshank Prison, He arrives at the Shawshank prison and befriends a fellow prisoner Red who finds Andy's acts rather daring as well as amusing during his time at the shawshank prison. Using just a small Hope and Time as his tools Andy finds out a way to escape from that hellhole, emerging as the most extra-ordinary prisoner of his time.The story revolves around friendship, strength and hope. Andy gains respect among the fellow prisoners and makes the passage for his escape so cleverly which even the warden himself could not figure out till the end, The climax of the story is what makes it a huge hit amongst the masses. Only after watching such a master piece by Stephen King can one actually find out why It tops the list of IMDb top 250.	10
 Best Movie Ever		10
 Good Enough But...	"Movie is good to watch. But I wonder how did it make to no.1 position on 250..!! Lots of better movies are there..!! And also it copies some scenes form ""Escape from Alcatraz (1979)""..!!that i would give 8/10 Again am telling you that movie's climax is good..!!People already watched this movie made their ratings 10. Why all the people has made it a 10, even it hasn't any specialty..!! The movie is just an o.k movie..!! it doesn't deserve even in top 100..!!The performances are truly above average but I think that the characters are not near as memorable.I wrote this comment only to encourage people to do the ratings wise fully .Many very good movies are under rated..!!please make your sense..!!"	7
 One of the extreme few i give 10 out of 10		10
 Best movie ever!	It contains everything important: - tension - good story - twists - good acting It's one of those movies, you'll think about long times and wont forget. This movie shows us, that we don't always need explosions and special effects. There are just some prisoners talking about life and freedom. And its still exciting and heartbreaking. One of the reasons I became a member of this site, was to rate THIS movie. It's my favorites and I recommend it to everybody. An other reason why this film is so grate, is that the viewer only looks from the outside. He is as surprised as the other prisoners itself. But at the end everything makes sense. It's like a perfect puzzle.	10
 Very Nice Plot	"The plot is very nice. I have seen a very few movies with such a strong plot. The recent being ""Boyhood (2014)."" Tim Robbins was very nice at acting (9/10) and Morgan's narration was more than perfect (10/10). I always love to see the movie again and again due to perfect story line, extra focused direction, perfect camera work, and exceptional acting. By focusing on the main story line, Frank Darabont has tried his way best to direct the movie from every possible angle to give every scene a real look and he successfully did it. I would love to see Mr. Tim Robbins and Mr. Morgan Freeman to be cast for another sequel of this movie with Shawshank Redemption 2, with another strong story line and more suspense/thrill."	10
 Best movie of all time	"When I was studying in B. Tech first year I started watching movies. I watched so many movies. After watching a movie ""TROY"" i said to myself that this is my best movie. Then I saw ""Titanic"" i said this is my best movie. After sometime i saw ""Braveheart"" then again i said now this is my best movie. But when i saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"" i said to myself that this is my best movie. Till yet i didn't found the replacement of this movie. This movie gives so much lessons for life to live. This movie never bored me while watching. I have seen this movie 5 times till yet. The best part of this movie is to fight with the situations. There will be always unfavorable conditions in life and you will meat bad people but you have to handle it."	10
 This is a fairy tale....		2
 Amazing	For a film to make you feel so emotionally attached to alleged criminals, it must be something special. Special is exactly the word for The Shawshank Redemption. A film so captivating and emotionally driven, it will stay with you for longer than you can imagine. The Stoic Theme carries the film in no way done before in the history of cinema, mixing both ingredients of film and music it provides a masterpiece. Compelling me to learn it on piano, to much degree of failure. The characters - beautiful. The Visuals - stunning. I do not see one flaw in this film, and I hope that no one else does. This movie is not cinema, it is an experience.	10
 One of the best movies that humans ever conceived...	Well, it's out to be said although many have said it already, but this movies is one of the best movies that humans ever conceived. I do not think this movie is about a conman escaping or even about finding redemption in a prison cell in the common way. I think that this movie is about fighting for what's right in the face of adversity and acknowledging what you really are deep down inside. Many of the inmates knew that deep down inside they were free men, even while surrounded by high trapping walls. Maybe that's what kept them living day after another. All in all, it's a great movie that surpassed and overshadowed many other ones.	10
 The process of life better manner explained	The idea of this film is to convey the state of solitude that man is, it's like the myth of Sisyphus which the Greeks and then Camus highlighted in his works. I must say that the character Andy Dufresne develops patience achievement, because with patience and look for the right time, the freedom that comes slowly after years in his master plan is won.Such feelings which we know must bend to make the right decisions and it is there that this film achieves an impeccable staging, making paraphrase of life itself.Speaks also of how one should live their best under the conditions, and evidently speaks about sacrifice because often we lose our status quo to achieve a goal or purpose.In conclusion, it is a poetic film a delicacy of philosophical study of easy digestion.	10
 One of the best movies ever made	The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that would move you to tears. I Know many people would agree with me when i say that this is one of the the best movies ever made and you would too once you see it.It mainly revolves around. It was nominated for 7 Oscars and 1 golden globe. I'm a bit sad that it didn't win any Oscars, cause it deserved at least one ,for best picture.The story focuses on Andy a man who was convicted for murdering his wife and his wife's lover. He was imprisoned in Shawshank prison, where he met Red. The story revolves around Andy and Red increasing their friendship and Andy doing all sorts of stuff in changing the prison.If it was up to me, I'd give it a 9.8 rating.	10
 One of the best films to grace the silver screen		10
 Best Movie Ever	Best Movie Ever!!!! Morgan Freeman's Best Movie. Superb Voice and awesome performance. His voice and dialogues in this movie are amazing. My favorite movie of all time. Couldn't ask much. A thrill for movie lovers. Wonderful story and screen play. Couldn't take the eyes for a sec. Absolute treat to watch this movie. Also, a Superb Direction and What a climax... Tim Robbins performance was also absolutely wonderful......It was a thrill to watch Must Watch Movie.... You will Definitely get goose bumps at the end!!! All the characters were amazing Deserves to be #1 of all time. Enough said!!! If you didn't watch it already...........Watch it!!! If watched, then surely you will watch it again and again.	10
 One of the greatest movies i've ever seen	The thing is this film is similar to Forrest Gump in that it is narrated by someone and it takes place over 30 years. There are also historical events that are mentioned in both films. The difference was that Gump opened like gangbusters and was packed weeks into its run while Shawshank did not. Roger is right, it needed to be left in theaters and build on word of mouth and then it would've played a year. Columbia, a big studio, wasn't interested, which is a shame. Seeing this film again recently I couldn't stop watching because you see what prison life is like and how it operates and takes lives from people like Brooks and Red, who become institutionalized. It is sad when films can't seem to build word of mouth and even in today's climate, they don't play many weeks.	10
 yes! likely the all time best	Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff.Red (Morgan Freeman)and Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) are amazing actors that make this movie one of the best of all time. Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont.	10
 Best Movie EVER Made	This movie is simply powerful. Just thinking about the fact that this was based on a short story by Steven King was surprising. I'd never suspect THIS based off of his work. I don't want to waste time on talking about how much this movie moved me, but once you watch this brilliant movie, you will see why I am praising it so much. This movie contains: Fantastic Directing, Brilliant Story Telling, Superb Acting, Great Cinematography, Music That Fits the Mood, and the last item on this list is... Everything You Want in a Movie. I am NOT going to tell you about this movie, I would want you to watch it your self, and witness all of this film has to offer you. This movie inspired me so much and is a perfect example to other movies how to make a PERFECT movie.	10
 One of the best	This may not be the best movie ever made in the history of cinema, but it certainly has its merits and is definitely worth a watch. For one thing, Shawshank is a fresh take on the Prison genre and it introduces a bit of color in the 90s. Ironically, this happened to hit the Oscars the same year as Forest Gump and Pulp Fiction, which also featured black-white protagonist pairings. Even better, this is one of the best, if not THE best film adaption of a Stephen King work. I was genuinely pleased with the cinematic liberties taken to make a story that was more than simply an adaption of a short story. In fact, this could be an example of a movie that is better than the source material.	9
 Excellent		10
 Andy was a successful man but he was convicted murdered his wife so he was sent to jail. First few years he finds it hard to stay in there but then he make some changes.	"Currently I am studying Film Critics at university and I was suggest to watch and write a review on The Shawshrank Redemption. The film is about Andy told by Red, Andy's good friend at the prison called ""Shawshrank"". I must say that I'm pretty positive about this movie at the beginning because of Morgan Freeman. My expectation wasn't fail but i felt a little bored at the end. However, i thought the plot was going to be more complicated than this. The movie gives a lot of survival feeling though which makes me quite into the movie. Besides, the whole plot was very touching especially for the scene that Brook commit suicide. It seems like the guys who went in there can never find happiness when they came out. I believe this movie gives out motivation to be strong and really learn what living is really. It shows mood incredibly well for the depressed part but sometimes I find the story goes very slowly so I get bored."	4
 Happy 20th Anniversary ......I think		5
 No doubt it is best of the best.	So why am I posting a review now, pity me because I just acknowledge this film a while from my film class. As the same as other review I was moved by this film, this movie affects me strongly that even I watch it over and over again. I've always have the impression of the first time seen.The best thing is you have to prepare to be moved by the hopes that emerged in this story, no special effects or tricks. This is just plain simple and impressive by its owns way portraits the very common life of men. In such despair , its amazing that when you watch this movie you can taste the freedom. The strong power of hope and determination will blow your mind.So no doubt this is the best film I've ever seen, as far as my concern there is no minor things that will stop me from rating it 10.	10
 Awesome Movie		10
 One of the Greatest movie... Ever MadE.... !!!	"Must watch movie.... Ultimate screenplay...TIM Robins superb.. A masterpiece from Frank Darabont ... this moviemade ma day....... the one of the most intelligent movie ever saw.. It is an extraordinary motion that people ""will"" be talking about in 50 or 100 years. Stephen King""s novel adaption best movie... Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It tells a lesson about life. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me.... It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances."	10
 My short review	This is simply one of the best movies I've seen in my whole life. It has got everything, from drama to some subtle comedy and every scene contains its own cliffhanger - once you start watching, you cannot stop until you've watched the whole movie. And once you've watched the movie once, you will want to see it again and yet again, there is no point in time this movie will bore you.Its raw genius, from the actors and to the director - everybody did an exceptional job to give this movie true character. No movie will ever surpass this movie as the best movie of all times. From the plot, one can draw some conclusions about whats going to happen, but that is irrelevant, to just follow through the story and to be able to enjoy whats being displayed is the greatest thing one can do.	10
 Tied for the best movie I have ever seen		9
 The best thing for still hopeful	When you reach the end of this masterpiece you can't imagine that you can surrender,you to fight to the end . Here, battle is not a choice ,you have to fight otherwise you will be defeated even destroyed completely . In my life ,I think that I haven't seen such quantity of hope ,this movie made me more motivated to struggle in my life and gave me the power to face such difficult situations even impossible to solve or deal with . The whole crew, director, actors, writers,.......etc have done a great effort to make such magnificent masterpiece to inspire the people every where and every when . Finally , I hope every one enjoy the movie and learn the important lesson not to give up , never	10
 Top 10 on my list	What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said already?This movie has all the elements required to make this a outstanding film.Great crew, from director to editor and everyone in between. Then of course you have a great story. No film is great without a great story. Finally, you simply cannot forget the masters of storytelling. I'm of course referring to the performers.From opening scene until end credits, this film with draw out of you ever single human emotion and will leave you applauding for more.Bottom line, you must see this film to see true cinematic greatness.	10
 I'll choose this if I can only watch one movie in my life	I watched this movie when I'm in college,it should be 9 years ago. There's not so much fun in college,so when weekends come,some student will rent a movie CD and broadcast in classroom. One day my roommate and I are passing a classroom,find there's a movie on,we went in. In the beginning,we found it boring,but with the story moving on,we forgot to go back and obsessed by the story.After it ended,we asked the student who broadcast this CD which movie is it,and then came the name...The story is so encouragement，full of positive,it teaches me that don't give up on what you want,and insist,try your best.You have to work hard for what you really want,and should never be defeated。	10
 Definitely deserves to be in the top 250!	One of the best movies I've ever seen. Only down point if any,I would say would be the twist at the end which was quite predictable to me,which it maybe wasn't 20 years back. Other than that,awesome movie,must watch at least once :) The acting,direction,script,everything was top notch by the 90s standards. Bit slow paced initially but then works very well for the movie and helps the viewer engross entirely with it. Morgan Freeman,as usual was at his best no doubt,love almost all his movies. One of the best actors of this time.Go for it if u wanna experience the #1 movie of all time :)	10
 All time best movie		10
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	"Central to the film's success is a riveting, unfussy performance from Robbins. Freeman has the showier role, allowing him a grace and dignity that come naturally. There are times when The Shawshank Redemption comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. As the uptight banker, Robbins does some of his subtlest acting to date. As his hardened but resilient friend, Freeman is simply miraculous, giving the role so much depth, dignity, and good humor that you feel that you've known this man forever. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption. Some of ""The Shawshank Redemption'' comes across as outrageously improbable. Yet the film keeps pulling you back with its sense of striving humanity slowly turning the tables against evil."	10
 Awesome Movie	This is truly one of the best movies ever made! Stephen King is an amazing writer and this movie reflects his abilities to a T. I cannot pick a favorite between this and The Green Mile. It could not have better done!!! The movie was perfectly casted. All of the actors were superb in their acting. It followed the book rather well, with very few changes made. If you love Stephen King, you will love this movie. I love Andy and Red's relationship the most. And it had a perfect ending. I have told everyone I know to watch this movie at least once, just for the experience. Everyone I have told to watch it has thanked me for telling them to, saying they too loved this movie. Even my children love this movie and will sit through its entirety without complaint. Absolutely a 10 out of 10!!!!	10
 Top 250	Top250 years will take place in the first place. I think the world's best film. Excellent script, great players. Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.	10
 Wasn't The Best	I have to admit, I never read the novel this is based on. But I'm guessing the people who don't like the movie at all (which is fine), either haven't read the book or don't like the book. I'm saying this, because what you are getting here, is very close to adult films. Something people in Germany (censors that is), do not have a problem with (the movie is rated 16+).I can only guess the movie will be NC-17 (if they rate it) in America. There are explicit images of male genitalia, a lot bare breasts (though mostly of our main female lead). With all that said, I went into the movie with the impression I wouldn't like it at all.	
 Best Movie	This film is one of my top 10 films of all-time. I love everything about it, such as the casting, the performances, the story line etc. If you haven't seen this, you are really missing out.Don't deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching such a stellar movie. Go now and watch this movie if you have never seen it. Perfect casting, amazing story, emotional performances. Just perfect. There are no words to describe how good this movie is.This movie is completely amazing, everything was perfect, and the ending, the way he escaped jail, just fantastic, original, awesome with great performances, Morgan Freeman just kicked ass in this film,so I' am very happy with the final result of this movie.	9
 Top 5 Favorite Movies of All Time	"For someone who always thinks they are being wrongly accused of something, this movie is the ultimate journey of one man's redemption and triumph over his past. Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the entire cast are flawless in their performances and this movie hits the head right on the nose with the social justice politics and policies of the time period that the movie appeared in. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good ""man vs. nature"" story. One of my favorite scenes is when Timothy plays the opera music in the office. The Italian arias that the two women sing are incredibly beautiful and speak to the caged bird that he has become who wants to break free and soar past his circumstances"	10
 It's not just about a prisoner's escape, it's more than that.	Obviously agree that it is one of the greats, but it is a bit over-rated. But,it is a work of art. the actors were terrific. of course, there is the god of narration, Morgan freeman. it has a great message and all. has no effects whatsoever, but relies just on the storyline which is rare these days. it can be emotional for most people. direction - costumes - intensity - and most of all,there is hope. It is not on par with godfather 1 and godfather 2 and also there is Schindler's list. the villain could be better. If this is what someone says about Shawshank redemption, do not fall for it. And it's all about perspective. It has a powerful message waiting for you to recognize. A message of hope.	9
 The Shawshank Redemption	It's a exceptional Film. It's between my most well-liked flicks. It depicts the story of Andy Dufresne, a famed banker who Have a look at Shawshank for murder of his partner. This Motion picture depicts friendship of two diverse persons currently proudly possessing many sights, just how it grows. He was truly intelligent gentleman as he manufactured his friendship with corrupted Warden though while in the Jail Yet it Undoubtedly was just one sided. Ultimately, when he escapes Using the jail, he Typically typically normally takes down the whole life of Warden and his colleagues. Best correct after few moments, his Pal Pink also receives from jail and travels to Texas and fulfill his Great Mate Andy.Normally this Movie was excellent and perhaps it really is the best. It justifies to be #1. I am pondering how this Film not get Oscar for Most important motion Image round the calendar twelve months 1994.	4
 Breaking Big Rocks Into Little Rocks		8
 Human beings	So this guy really wanted to say when I pulled him out of the TMD and beat on TV , he did not know the truth. His mother does not know how much pain he suffered for , was how many crimes . He insists , clinging to his father 's death . Really, careful thought, we live in the world, most do not also have experienced this state duffers it? But compared to what it is we do not fix. I was easily into the drama of the people , so that it is possible that this actor ( I'm too lazy to check who he is ) this impression in my mind too deep , perhaps after several of his ministry let me get out to play this impression on him . But to be honest, played good.	9
 Awesome movie		10
 Nonsense	This movie is based on the resilience of a guy whom had the chance to be all along his detention in the same cell, near the outer wall of the prison. Then, of course, no one thought that a wall made of mud, which conveniently doesn't make a sound when dug, wouldn't be sufficient to prevent a detainee, who has nothing else to do, to dig it in to get out.The rest of the movie is stepping up to be the masterpiece we all know and love. But this, I can't call it a flaw, but these unlikely premises really bugged me watching it. I still call it a good movie. But for it to be THE best film, on this site, is pretty far-fetched.	7
 A must watch movie!	Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie ever made. This includes all time frames and genres. There are no flaws in this story; only brilliance. It's simply a remarkable story. It's a timepiece feature with an amazing cast. Character development is top-notch. The story line and delivery are extraordinary. I wish I could re- watch this movie over again as if I had never seen it before, so do yourself a favor... if you're watching this movie or plan to watch this movie for the first time... turn off your phone, dim the lights and be prepared to be amazed. It's an enriching story with adult content that is suitable for older kids. You will laugh. You will cry. You will get angry. And... you will feel love, hope and redemption unlike any movie you have ever seen before. Shawshank Redemption is unforgettable.	10
 One of the best movies.	I decided to make a review about a fantastic film, which I personally think it should deserve a lot better, it was forced to be re-released to reach more than the budget. The Shawshank redemption a movie directed by Frank Darabont The Shawshank Redemption is an American drama film made by writer Stephen King from the beginning, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles. The film is about the successful banker Andy ( Tim Robbins ) who is wrongly convicted for murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life. This is one of the toughest prisons in the United States during the 1940s. There he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) as they quickly becomes very good friends. Years after years Andy just gets more and more famous among the guards, and the prisoners, and it ends with Andy helps a guard to get $ 25,000 as a gift. Then the police- officer Norton realizes that Andy might be useful, so he started taking care of the prison economy. It causes him to get control of what happens in the prison and it gives him great opportunities to escape from the prison. The film has a strong and important purpose that you should never give up and always have hopes for what will happen. That trust is a big impact on relationships, The film can be viewed by anyone of any age and it is a very good and interesting movie. It defiantly deserves better because it is a touching movie and very inspiring.	10
 A rating over 9 on IMDb - That is impressive	"This movie is just awesomely brilliant. Okay, English teachers may not like that description, but simply put, this movie is one great movie. This movie is about a prison in Maine named Shawshank. A wealthy banker, Andy Dufrense (Tim Robbins) is arrested, charged, and convicted for murdering his wife and her lover. He claims that he did not do it, but the evidence points directly to him. He claims that he is innocent, but so does everybody else in Shawshank. Andy, though, proclaims his innocence right through to the end. He says ""the only time I became crooked was when I came to Shawshank"".The Shawshank Redemption is adapted from the Stephen King novel ""Rita Heywood and the Shawshank Redemption"", and as is typical for Stephen King, the horror comes not from the supernatural but from the natural. The horror here is of being thrown into prison an innocent man, and then never being able to leave because of the corruption all around. Andy is clearly innocent by the closing stages of the movie, but by that time he is such a key element to the Warden's plans, that there is no way he is ever going to be allowed to leave. Ebert speaks of the horror of time and of daily routine here, but more so there is the sense of alienation. Once one is inside the walls one can never really leave. When one prisoner, Brooks Halten (James Whitmore) is released, he kills himself due to the fact that he is free. Red (Morgan Freeman) says when he is finally released, that without the strict routine of the prison system and with the freedom of daily life, he just cannot cope.Andy is different, he has hope, and he retains this hope right through until the end. We do not see the big picture until the end of the movie, when we are revealed all, but Andy remains calm, patient, and resolute, knowing that in the end he is going to be free. He is also an opportunist, he sees an opportunity and he takes it, and when he does, he gains the friends that he needs to survive in the prison. He is not a pushover, for when the sisters seek to violate them, he fights, and he fights brutally, but he knows that in the end he will be out and he puts up with it.This movie is about hope. It is not a fantasy: Red says ""if this was a fantasy then he would have fought them off and everything would have been fine, but it is not."" This is real and King has pulled no punches. Yet also the hope is there; we see real characters with real fallibilities. Even Andy falls occasionally and is blackmailed into submission, but he has that hope and he always looks forward to freedom."	8

 Greatest Movie ever	I don't know about the other viewers but I personally think this is one of the greatest movies ever made.I usually don't have a great taste in movies and I really enjoy watching chick flicks and I get bored of watching some movies that actually have very good ratings on this site,but I think that if,me,a person with the worst taste in movies ever liked this,then its a very great movie.I enjoyed it a lot and I didn't get bored at all...for the first time ever. I think everyone should watch this movie. But am I the only one here who thinks that the rating for this movie on this site is kinda low?I think it should be a little higher...just saying. Anyways bottom line if you haven't watched this movie yet, you are wasting your life.So buy it and watch it. That's all folks ;)	10
 Stuck in the middle for me	I'm not giving a low rating because I'm against whats popular. Shawshank Redemption is a great film, its actually one my favorites. The characters are portrayed very well, except for Andy. I know he is supposed to be an emotionless socially awkward guy who only has one facial expression. In that case he played his role perfectly but I don't think its a wise choice to have a... main? Character like that? I'm not sure if Red was the main character, he is our eyes and ears so...Either way the film shows cinematic genius and truly amazing story telling. I enjoyed every second of it, some say certain areas of the story dragged on too long but hey its prison. Every moment in prison is dragged along. But I don't know about being the greatest film on IMDb. I would say Citizen Kane should be number 1. Citizen Kane is so amazing its actually art. So again loved Shawshank Redemption and I wish more movies were like it, but I don't know about greatest film of all time.	6
 Slow but study wins the race........And hope for the best....	Best movie ever ....Shawshbk redemption.....The big lesson in this film is to wait wait wait until you get the best opportunity to get rid of any thing u want.......He has much patient to get rid from the jail..........wow awesome.......when he the rock on the pipe ...the timing was absolutely right........firstly the light came then the voice came of the storm when he was running off.............The acting of a black man (supporting role)(Morgan Freeman) was actually great......He act better then the main hero (Tim Robbins)....And although I can say about this movie is that you can do every thing what you want to if you are in right way............Thanks....... regards...	10

 I used to think this was the best		7
 The Greatest Movie	It has long been my contention that it is the movie-maker's task to hold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent, difficult-to-follow symbolisms. That having been said, I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high- adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the viewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar. (Since Citizen Kane, at least. )Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film with the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American Film Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so myopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr. Strangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time.	8

 The best	IT is one the best movies ever made....The movie starts of slow but the way the situation is depicted in the movie is just awesome..There are a lot of movies about prison break but none better than this..Not only me,everyone who saw this movie will rate it 10 on 10..It is just a visual delight to the watchers..Seriously characterized and perfectly directed.. I would request everyone to see this one..It is total use of the minutes in which the movie starts and ends... I also like the accent in which the language is being told to the audience.. Clearly one of my favorite movie.. Wish this kind of movies come along always so that we the audience can be treated to such delightful experience..	10
 The most overrated hyped up movie I have ever watched but its good.	I cannot believe that it took me 17 years to see this movie and was it worth the wait well here's what the film is about.The story is about a young banker played by Tim Robbins who was convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to life in Shawnshank prison where he meets a former crook named Reed played by the brilliant actor of our generation Morgan Freeman. The two become inseparable as they deal with prison life and the guards betting the HELL out of some of the prisoners; one got killed to death by the guard while the other hanged himself to death.Everyday they have to dig up holes and eating disgusting food, but will Andy(aka Robbins)ever get out of prison and did he really kill his wife and her lover in cold-blood?Bottom line is this; I'm 22 years of age a female who hates watching these kind of movies as there really not my cup of tea,I'm sort of a romantic/fantasy/cartoon/drama/weepie kind of chick and I hate watching violent movies,but this movie was really good;but seriously is it the best movie in the world? well for me its not in fact its all about dealing with prison life and the whole motto is get busy or die trying. Overall I did enjoy this movie but I wouldn't be watching it again. Once is enough for me.SO I'm giving it a 7.5/10	7
 Worth watching but overrated!	In my opinion this movie is far from the greatest movie of all time. Thou, it's a thrilling story, includes great acting and visually constitutes of some extraordinary cinematography. The overall impression you're left with after watching the shawshank redemption does not make a lasting one. I don't know if it's the relatively dull undertone or the mainstreamness of its story style, which makes it a rather ordinary movie experience. I believe the Godfather was a better choice for the number one spot, however there are a lot of other great ones out there. I don't regret watching this movie, it's well worth its 2,5 hours and I recommend you to watch it for the movie classic it is. But I wont bother to see it again.	6
 Finally a Steven King short stories plays out better on screen	Never has perseverance played such a strong character on film. The respect and friendship that came from it were against all odds, but to do so one would need hope. Tim Robbins' Andy Dufresne manages that intangible saving grace over decades while falsely imprisoned and it's Morgan Freemans' Red who narrates for us and in constant perspective against the institutionalization of the Maine State penitentiary. The symbiotic relationship between the two is perfect cinema chemistry. The ending is quite fantasy, but makes for good afternoon drama on TNT who, I believe bought the rights for a cheep price, and that's a happy ending for Ted Turner!	8
 Morgan Freeman is a man without freedom but gets it in his own little way		7
 It's a good movie	It's a good movie. I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue. An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption--must have been in the source material. Darabont explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he lovingly and patiently sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery.	7
 Overrated, a good movie		6
 Overall A Very Enjoyable Film	"In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff. In exchange, he is able to improve the prison library and bring some dignity and respect back to many of the inmates, including Red. Based on a story by Stephen King, The Shawshank Redemption was the directorial debut of screenwriter Frank Darabont. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi"	5
 May change your view on the justice system.	I would recommend this film. It has a good plot and in the end all the small things you never noticed all add up. So overall it's a good film. It has a good meaning to it which a lot of films nowadays lack. However during the first hour of the film I found it quite boring. It was as if the film was leading to something and although things happened it just didn't interest as me as much. In saying that the film really does have a good meaning which is why I like it so much.Although I would recommend this film there are other films which have a similar meaning which I personally think are better.I gave it 7 out of 10 simply because this film is above the average film but it's not exceptional.	7
 Entertaining	The movies is very good and near spellbinding. I have seen it more than once. Every time I see it playing on TV, I still watch it. The plot, the acting, the dialog are very good. You do tend to lose yourself at times. The plot is also unusual. It also has some my favorite lines. But, I am really surprised to see Shawsank Redemption at the top. I guess, most people look for entertainment value and overlook things that are not very possible. The movie tends to be a bit unrealistic for certain events. They could have made it more realistic, since everything else was done to perfection.Should you watch it? Absolutely.Should you give it a 9/10 rating? I am not so sure.	7
 The Shawshank Redemption: An Utter Travesty	Let me start out by stating the fact that I am a HUGE Morgan Freeman fan. I absolutely adore most of his work, however, The Shawshank Redemption is the only exception as to just how far my love of Morgan Freeman will go. First of all, in the opening scene, when Morgan is getting rubbed down by two husky white men in the shower, the hot water handle should be facing the LEFT, unless this film was shot in Canada or Utah, I see no reason for this subtle inaccuracy. Second, why did Bruce Willis decide to concentrate his fire strictly on the escapees of the prison?! Why not on the inmates that were tucked safely in their cells?! Finally, the third and final problem that I had with this movie, is this: Hadley is arrested for murder, crying like a little girl as he is taken away, while the Warden decides to shoot his brains out.While the others would talk about Andy's exploits, Red just listens. One day he receives a blank postcard from the Border, knowing that his friend made it there in one piece.Red manages to pass the next parole hearing with an angry honesty that was missing from his past meetings, and is sent to the halfway house used by Brooks. He is lost on the outside and would like to return to Shawshank, but instead he fulfills his promise to Andy, and follows his friend's plan to find the tree he mentioned, and a black box containing a wad of money and a letter.Red breaks the law to violate his parole, and takes the bus down to the border. At the end, on the beaches of Zihuatanejo, we see Andy working on a boat, about to be joined by another free man, Red. Honestly, if you're even considering watching this movie, please spend your time elsewhere. It's terrible.	2
 Not all that it's cracked up to be.	"This film is no. 1 on the top 250. I would have to disagree with that. The reason why I don't think it deserves to be 1 or even 25 for that manner is...Tim Robbins acting and this might be coming from a biased point of view because I have never liked Tim Robbins in any one of his films. I have never liked him because of his slow delivery that makes him sound a little bit like Robert De Niro in Awakenings. Also another reason I don't think it deserves to be no. 1 is because of it's plot. This plot is completely unoriginal. I mean wow an African-American man and a white man become friends in pre civil-rights movement America. One of the few things I did enjoy was the whole middle part (i'll try not to give too much away.) The middle part consists of Morgan Freeman getting out of jail and searching for Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins). Also one of the few things that is fantastic about this film is the supporting acting and the Directing of this film. Overall I would put ""Shawshank"" at about 35 on this list."	8
 Yeah its a good film and all but being #1 really deludes its over all effectiveness		8
 Average A Movie	I consider a technically well made movie, good story with great actors, but nothing more. Use the melodic drama injustice, but not quite spectacular, as a masterpiece of cinema. I think a great movie for afternoon session, but not the level of movies that have the best score of all time. This I consider an injustice. This film has to have something else to be an excellent movie. I respect the majority opinion here, but I put my sincere considerations, here is a democratic space to put our feelings and emotions. Film is a passion, and I'm sure we'll be together to honest debate with many other films. I liked this movie, but without much enthusiasm, as in the comments here. For me, a movie only average ...	4
 One of the best films of all time, but entirely predictable!	Firstly, as you probably know, this film is great! There's no two ways about it, this film is great and always will be for many decades to come.The casting is perfect and the performances of Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are just brilliant. The film also has a message which all viewers will relate to in one way or another and the last half an hour is probably the best period in the film.However, the plot of Shawshank is entirely predictable and the movie is way too long with periods where absolutely nothing is happening.All in all, Shawshank Redemption is a great film, if not the best of the last century. It has many things going for a bit but is let down by a few dull scenes and a predictable story line.	8
 (Red)'s (Red)emption	Beginning as a story about a man named Andy, who is sentenced two life sentences for killing his cheating wife and the man with her. Except he didn't do it. Beginning as a simple story, it develops. And slowly but surely, it rises and builds. He meet's Red, a inmate in the prison. He builds a library, a prison and a friendship. And he loves getting beer. Even with out suspense, it's kind-of suspenseful. The ending is very satisfying. It is not a okay movie. It is a great film. One of the best. 8 out of 10. A fine rating for me. As good as King's story. If you have not seen it, give it a try. It deserves it's high rating. In my top ten films. As it is known as a masterpiece, I have to say, it is. And as it has trolls, I have to say, they are so wrong.	10
 Red........is a.........Free man	Essentially, The Shawshank Redemption is about the survival of the human spirit---in a colossally adverse situation. The brutality and corruption which goes on in Shawshank Prison...never hits the viewer right between the eyes (like it should). Thats due to the calming tones of our narrator...Morgan Freeman. Mans in-humanity to man....is on full display here...and its this strange mix of violence, upright stoicism and high morality that makes for a heady brew. Lets not under-rate the narration of Morgan Freeman---this was a huge reason why this movie is now considered to be...a Classic. So, why did it bomb when it was released ? Maybe it needs a couple of viewings for all the gears to mesh (Who knows?) My major criticism , is that i thought the two leads needed to be a bit more edgy , a little bit more angry. After all ..they weren't Saints. However, the messages that most people take from this movie are positive (me included). I do not think its a Classic------but it sure is a powerful movie ... and a very good one.	8
 What a movie	"Having not read the book initially, this movie blew me away. With such intricacy to detail and screenplay which kept the viewer gripped The Shawshank Redemption was one movie which ranks as most appealing to me.The whole time I, as a viewer, did not expect that the ending was going to be like that, to that extent. The acting was indeed superb and the way of expressing the changes in character and settings was impeccable.To reiterate to an audience what was occurring inside of the jail, and to depict changes in emotions and feeling with such clarity definitely justifies that the director of this movie was more than the average one in Hollywood.1994, 18 years ago, was when this movie was made but to the level to which it takes one is truly outstanding. One is absorbed by it, and there is no confusion about what is happening but rather thoughts in the viewers' minds about ""What is gonna happen next?"" These thoughts are present when watching a horror/ thriller movie for the most part, but for aficionados of different genres to all like this movie proves that this was one heck of a movie.Cannot miss this movie; it is one that makes one think, learn, and be entertained simultaneously."	8
" ""Fear can keep you prisoner. Hope can set you free"""		5
 Hope is the access key to a bright future.	"At the beginning when you watch the movie you will see the film was an ordinary and doesn't deserves to be the best film in cinema history, but don't be fooled by the title of the book because you don't know the content is real only when you deepening it,, because the viewer breathtaking start the story epic and heroic ""people say that old movies the best of the modern I agree with that as soon as I watched this film, but i don't always agree that it is impossible to logically ""..I was surprised in the past before I watch the film to see what all of these popular about so? ... I have started gradually discovered that when I saw a lot of details about the main story ..I raised my admiration for the story associated with some double by (andy) and that the new person who came recently to the prison, which is called (Tommy) who told the story to (Andy) about the real killer of his wife and her lover .. So it was a story I didn't hear the strangest of them before. I must say that this scene is the strangest sight I have ever seen. This is true art, to begin to describe this film as a story of hope I have some words about hope, I like to write to you, which I doubt really that it will consolidate in the mind of the reader when they hear or read (do not give up that stalled your feet and fell into a large hole claims the prison will come out of them and you are more coherent and strength to that, whatever the difficulties of life they are experiencing and if the problems and your weight on your shoulders and if you really want to change, if you want to transform your life for the better, you must demonstrate hope, whatever the circumstances that prevailed in that bright future is linked with hope!) If you are a fan of crime stories and movies that relate to imprisonment and escape from it in a way you never heard before , which will satisfy your desire when you see the film because it contains a lot of meanings powerful and sincere feelings for those looking for hope and redemption. But not in the knowledge that this film does not hold Action or any of that because everything is owned by the effects of spiritual and words from the heart and the deep connotations."	5
 The Best Movie Ever Made !?		10
 Overrated movie?		7
 Thanks for everyone's high rating. I adapted the short story for the screen		10
 Great Movie at first		8
 Not Bad but doesn't deserve to be number 1 in my opinion	This the most overrated movie I have seen, how this movie is number 1 on IMDb is beyond me. Now this movie isn't bad it's just that the movie is so over rated that there are movies not in the top 250(Jurassic Park) that I'd rather watch than this. And that are more ground breaking than this movie was. Now the best part of this movie in my opinion is Morgan Freeman he is just SUCH a talented actor in the position he plays in this movie. He is the main reason I watched this movie. This is not Morgan's best movie but certainly not his worst. The reason I gave this a 7 is how over rated it is. I'm not saying I hate this movie, which I don't, I'm just shocked at the fact that its number 1?! There are a lot more movies out there that deserve more credit than this film.	8
 Shamelessly old-fashioned, manipulative entertainment with Biblical connotations	"The year is 1947 and ""tall glass of water with a silver spoon up his ass"" Andy Dufresne is sentenced to serve two back-to-back life sentences in Shawshank Penitentiary for the 'cold-blooded' murder of his wife and her lover. We are shown flashbacks to the events leading up to their slaying, but not enough for us to convict Andy along with the judge and this makes for an intriguing character watching the movie for the first time 'round. Inside the walls of Shawshank, Andy still claims his innocence, only to find he isn't alone. But it isn't long before he approaches go-to-guy Ellis 'Red' Redding for a rock hammer and Rita Hayworth poster, eventually becoming best buddies with him.The theme of the piece is freedom and what it means to the men inside. The elderly 'Brooks' Hatlen is what Darabont calls ""the spine of the story"", who walks the straight and narrow path upon his release from prison but whose institutionalisation holds him back from enjoying free life and participating in the outside world. Red is also ""an institutional man"" whose constant rejections from the parole board have led him to believe that hope is a bad thing. Whereas seemingly infinite oasis of hope Andy, who after being raped constantly by 'the Sisters' and being sent way down in the hole a buncha times, still maintains his spirit. ""Salvation lies within"", as the Warden says.However, there is also a physical journey Brooks, Red and Andy take. Prison represents Hell in this very symbolically Christian story, the halfway-house Brooks and Red go through, Purgatory, and Zihuatanejo, the ""warm place with no memory"" is of course, Heaven. Andy is even baptised after escaping the walls of the prison when he falls out of the sewage pipe into the water of the crick in the pouring rain. The most seemingly Christian man in the movie, Warden, is actually the Devil with sadistic Captain Hadley as his Beelzebub. Writer and director Frank Darabont uses posters of sex symbols Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch to mark the passage of time Andy serves (just under twenty years) inside, while Andy uses them to cover up his escape route. 'The Shawshank Redemption' may appear to be in colour at first, but it is very much a black-and-white old-school Capra story, with modern blood, profanity and references to sodomy. Bad guys are bad guys and good guys are good guys. The Hollywood way is a timeless thing. People climb out of sewers without a trace of turd on them and show no visible signs of ageing in twenty years.The movie has the same values of Capra, whom Darabont acknowledges as a major influence, and that isn't a bad thing when you stand it up against the largely nihilistic or simply stylistic movies of it's era, ergo all of QT's work, Scorsese's gangster pictures of that decade etc. The American film industry of the time's fondness for the downer ending, or lack of one was probably what drove the public out to the rental stores in the mid-nineties in search of this after the perhaps off-puttingly schmaltzy Gumpfest of this movie's year in the cinema failed to relate to many on a human level. 'Shawshank' has the necessary grit and real-life situations for a modern audience to get into it, but it also tells them what to think and feel with it's near constant narration and score like a movie from the forties might have. This is perhaps why it is such a firm favourite of the casual viewer, as it carries them along rather than allowing them to figure anything out or decide on their own ending. What the enormous popularity of the picture proves is that viewers would rather not be challenged but rather placated."	
 Excellent movie, but just goes to show ....	This is one of my favorite movies, but it does just go to show the importance of a great script, good casting and good direction. By that I mean that, for example, in this movie, the Tim Robbins character looks like someone who's admirable in every way in the world. But in real life, I saw Tim Robbins on some TV show where he was interviewed, and he came across as about as smart as a doorknob. I rate the movie an 8 and rate Tim Robbins a 5. What a jackass. Morgan Freeman is topnotch as always, and so is James Whitmore. Real professionals. So is Bob Gunton, the warden. To Tim Robbins credit, this was one of the best jobs he ever did, and maybe the very best. Also an unusually good job for Stephen King, who, in this flick, took a break from his usual moronic horror stories.	8
 Is it really a great movie?	"I heard about this movie very much some use to say ""this is the greatest ever movie"" but after watching it I started saying ""what a movie(I mean awful)?There is nothing great about this movie its a boring 2 hours crap.The story is about a guy called Andy(Tim Robbins) is convicted with crime which he has not committed.The whole movie describes Andy life in prison and finally how he escapes from the prison which takes almost 20 years for him to escape.If anyone has a very high expectations about this film then please erase it.Its just a ordinary movie there is nothing in this movie.If someone want to kill a time then watch it.I m going with 6/10 for this movie.Not so good,Not so bad."	9
 good escape movie, nothing more	I don't get how this movie could be the best rated in the IMDb. Sure it's good, maybe great, but come on, there are so many movies more meaningful, more groundbreaking, more shaking... That's a clever story with an amazing end. Actually, it's probably one of the happiest movie end. Maybe that's why people like it so much. Sure there is some message about justice, perseverance and courage, but all in all very classic and easy, not to say shallow. So I rated it 7 as an efficient entertaining movie. Nothing really special in the photography, nor in the acting, nor in the staging, nor politically. No complexity in the feelings nor in the characters. Really, it does deserve good critics, but certainly not being ranked best movie ever. I suppose the shawshank fanatics would also give the litterature nobel prize to Stephen King?	7
" ""Shawshank"" is probably the most perfect movie ever!"		10
 Best Story for a Movie ever Written		10
 Best Movie - what attitude of a man (ANDY) can	Really Fantastic,Nicely presented movie.Many positives only.No negatives No regular features.Immeterial of the place and situation,what a difference a person's(Andy's) attitude & initiatives can bring for himself and his friend RED who is a hopeless person.The Warden considered a worthy good person in the jail premises suppose to monitor all.He is good only in the eyes of the public and Law,but practically not so.The Director and the people who voted positive needs to be appreciated for their bold initiative of supporting such a low budgeted movie with emphasis on reality.Watching this movie by any person and in any situation can bring happiness to him/her and the people around.	10
 Finally registered on IMDb just to give this a 10/10.		10
 The perfect movie		10
 Absolutely Brilliant!		10
 Best Movie I have ever seen!	This movie was clearly the best movie I've ever seen. I watched it because it was number 1 on IMDb. Turns out my favorite movies like the return of the king, Forrest Gump, or the dark night didn't even come close to it. Why can't movie directors now days make such a good movie like this anymore? I would definitely recommend people to watch this if you like serious movies or meaningful movies. But if your the type of person who has ADHD and can't stand watching a talking scene for 10 seconds, i wouldn't recommend this to you. I would warn you that this is a long movie and it's not meant to watch it in birthday parties unless if your friends are all nerds or serious people. Also don't let your parents see it because there are many swear words in it, with some violence and almost a gay sex-scene. Other wise this movie is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	10
 Excellent but ultimately shamelessly aims to please the audience	"Don't get me wrong,I loved this movie. It's a beautiful and powerful fictional story, beautifully and powerfully told. Incredible job by everyone involved,and this is a very rich movie,it goes everywhere and never misses,and the control and confidence with which it is driven forward by Darabont reminded me of Coppola. It also reminded me somewhat of The Hill,Pappilon,Brubaker which are one of my favorite films about incarceration.Which brings me to my only discontent about Shawshank Redemption: the fact that Andy Dufresne succeeds in solving everything so completely. Revenge,freedom,happiness,reward for his patience and determination, all with one precise blow. And fate somehow cooperates.Well,that's too much for me.The happy ending was nice,but it was a bit too happy.It really goes straight for that pure part of our being that would want everything to be spectacular and complete, which gives us great emotions but ultimately ""insults"" our common sense.Andy Dufresne managed to beat the system. It took 18 years but he did it. Beautiful but I don't buy that. Makes for a great movie but doesn't leave much room to meditate.However I wouldn't even think of rating this one less than 9 and really deserves top marks. However,looking around me and thinking about my fate and the fate of others and the fate of the world, I see no Andy Dufresne's. I see the warden, I see Red and I see almost all characters but not Andy.He's like Tristan or Heracles to me,and I don't believe in those hero myths.So,almost perfect movie,but I'll make and take a point by rating it 9."	9
 Anything seems normal over time.	"Not the greatest but definitely up there. It has power and presence within several characters and grips you into a mind boggling reality of what could be and how any routine, even in a prison, can become all that one in the situation comes to expect. A very thoughtful outlook. After a while, what some on the outside ""looking in"" may consider outrageously profound comes to be the only reality worth acceptance to the one stuck on the inside of it all. After decades of being trapped, several men sharing life's toughest and most eye-opening experiences behind the same old walls come to realize that there may be even less opportunity available within boundary once they are ultimately freed."	7
 Good movie but 9 is too extreme,Thomas MC Fadden you are too extreme	Good movie but 9 is too extreme, is certainly one of the masterpieces of cinema, but like many Hollywood movies there is some bad things, when the protagonist moves down the sewer pipe, in reality it would be caught bad. A very nice movie that you can refer to the way that each of us must do just to get out of certain problems. After all you put poor grades to great films, especially horror. Hardly comes out of jail in a tunnel of excrement, jail and violence and degradation but you can get out mainly in Italy. However great interpretation of Morgan Freeman, many sentences are historical and should keep in mind. In the movies there must be some humanity in this film there is too much violence	8
 Not Number 1 Material, But Still Good		8
 Pretty good movie...one of those that you do not really need to watch from beginning to end.		7
 perfectly horrifying until 80% of the way through		8
 A gem of a movie	I started of watching this movie without any 'hype'. I knew it was a good film since it claimed the #1 spot in the IMDb top 250 movies.But after the credits rolled down,i very well understood why it claimed the #1 spot. This is a gem of a movie. If you missed it, then go watch it. It doesn't have speedy car chases,gripping war sequences or thumping action. But it conveys a strong & warm story to the viewers holding them close. I cant stress more. This is a 'must watch before you die' movie. or you'll cry in the heaven,having missed out this masterpiece... Morgan freeman & Tim Robbins are outstanding. They make the movie unforgettable with their outstanding performance.Each & everyone contribute their best in this movie.The background score is also superb,although it is less. I give it 9.5/10	10
 A Little Disappointing (just a little!)	"I rated this movie a 6 mainly because not only is this based on a Stephen King novel, but it is also IMDb's No.1 rated movie! I had very high expectations and presented this movie to watch with friends during our ""movie night"". I have to be honest, my high expectations did lead to a slight disappointment.I feel the movie was quite slow paced, it is about 2 and a quarter hours long and I felt a few parts could have been cut. The acting was definitely excellent, Morgan Freeman delivers his best all the time and the storyline and plot were very clear. One main thing though is that I don't understand how almost everyone is rating this a 10/10 when I feel there are many more movies probably more deserving? Could be classified as a good movie, a really good movie but certainly not a great movie."	6
 My Favorite Movie	"I was feeling a little discouraged the other day so I decided to put ""Old Faithful"" in the DVD player. Sure enough, after watching it--for who knows how many times--I felt inspired again. This movie is the best movie I've ever seen and maybe the best ever made. It's for anyone who needs to understand the power of hope--which means it's for everyone everywhere. I'm so proud it is the top movie on IMDb's Top 250, it sooo deserves it. I'm so glad it has touched others the way it touched me. If you haven't seen it--first of all, what planet are you on? lol--but seriously, go rent it. This is a movie that can change a life. If it doesn't do something to your insides, you probably don't have a pulse. I'm so grateful to Stephen King for writing it and to Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and the director and others for making it such a classic film. THIS is what movie-making was supposed to be."	10
 I was wrong	Very wrong. For so long, I avoided watching this film. I already knew what it was going to be like: the slightly above average movie with themes about hope and freedom. An all-out American flick which only a sentimental American could enjoy, and thus I resented it for holding the title as the best film ever. When it came to the themes I wasn't wrong; hope & freedom are the skeleton on which this film is built but the way it is executed far surpassed any anticipation I could have mustered, had I actually looked forward to watch it. Morgan Freeman is sublime as always, Tim Robbins perhaps even better. It slowly develops and unfolds, which is refreshing compared to all too many fast-cut films where it seems that the idea is that fast pace equals quality. I swallowed Shawshank Redemption whole, and even though I do not agree with its No. 1 ranking, I can now understand. Great movie!	8
 An interesting film		7
 Great but bad ending	"Most of the movie is great, but i think that the ending was bad. Dufresne telling Red about the field and Zihuatanejo makes it too to figure out that they'll both end up free and happy :) A very dramatic movie until then and with some funny catch lines from time to time. Great acting by not only Tim and Morgan but by most of the actors. The small ""stories"" besides the main one makes it great, too. The library, Red's tries to get released, the boy who had met the one who committed the crime that Dufresne was sentenced for and such things help the movie going on without making it boring. I also think that it isn't a movie that can be seen a lot of times but i'm not sure before having seen it a couple of times more"	8
 bing bang		10
 A good movie? Definitely...Deserving of the #1 spot of IMDb's Top 250? No		9
 not nearly close to greatest of all time	I can see why this movie is loved because it is moving and a great emotional experience, however #2 on the IMDb 250. Is this madness? It doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence as the Godfather. In comparison to the Godfather lets see:1. Is it better directed than the Godfather? Not even nearly close come on this movie didn't even get a nomination while Coppola has directed a masterpiece for all time.2. Is it better Acted than the Godfather? Please Morgan Freedman vs. Brando No question and the Godfather has better supporting actors all around.3. Better Screenplay? That is a joke, Mario Puzo owns it4. Better Music? Forget about the Godfather music is famous.5. So is it all around? not a chanceAs for the movie overall, I did like it but it is good not GREAT. I found it moving and a good film for the triumph of human spirit (its not better than a flew over the cuckoo's nest either) and I found it to be a good movie. On AFI's top 100 list, it was at 72 which is a more appropriate for it. I only compared to the Godfather because the Godfather and Shawshank are in the battle for #1 when its no contest. The ending was a fairy tale too. Yeah sure people always break out of jail with a rock chipper and then move to Mexico with their pal that they met in the joint. Please.	6
 Absolutely brilliant, a masterpiece of the 1990s	The direction, the acting, the writing, absolutely everything about this film is masterful.To start off with, the acting is excellent.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman both give what are arguably the performances of their career. Robbins acts with subtlety and understatement, speaking his lines and manipulating his body language with an effortless grace. Freeman's acting and narration are brilliant, in particular his monologue near the end.The direction is some of the best, a surprising and resounding foray into big budget films by Frank Darabont.And of course, the writing is the true shining feature. The creativity of the story, and the twists that give us the ultimate satisfaction are rarities among modern American films.This movie, is unquestionably one of the best films of the 1990s, and perhaps one of the best that has ever been made	10
 Vastly Over-rated	"I enjoyed this movie, but I still regard it as one of the most vastly over-rated films of all time. The villains in the film were 2-dimensional caricatures. There were no shades of gray in this film whatsoever. I can accept such villains when some element of the fairy tale, some element of the supernatural is introduced. For instance, it was okay for Chigurh to be cartoonish in No Country For Old Men because he was clearly supposed to be a symbol, a force of nature. The warden in Shawshank Redemption, on the other hand, isn't a force of nature, merely a poorly-written character. Honestly, the Shawshank Redemption was absorbing, but it wasn't a ""great film"" (in the capital-letters sense) by any stretch of the imagination."	6
 the best film ever made!!!(one of the only movies that i cried)		10
 Flawless	I wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie or not, but my brother kept raving about it and finally made me watch. I'm tremendously glad he did.The acting is perfectly accurate and plot leaves no gaps or unbelievable events that spoil the whole movie. This movie was amazing and was instantly my favorite movie. Morgan Freeman is absolutely perfect and so are Robbins and the rest of the cast. Wonderfully well put together as Freeman narrates his character's (Red) thoughts which I thought was pretty cool.I've never written a comment on IMDb, but this moment compelled me to write one. By far my favorite movie of all time.	10
 Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.		9
 A brilliantly written and filmed masterpiece		10
 only perfect film i have seen	i first heard of the shawshank redemption whilst watching the Oscars in 1994 and i was filled with the usual negative pre conceptions-old fashioned film,prison film,and a long film.therefore it was another 12 months before i watched it due to every man and his dog raving about it.i was then taken back by what is probably the only perfect film i have ever seen.from the damning of andy in the opening scene,the horrific suicide and rape scenes,the central relationship between red and andy,reds parole knockbacks,the enthralling escape right up to the uplifting ending,this is cinematic perfection and i doubt that as the years pass by Hollywood will ever be capable of making a film of this calibre again	10
 Great	I have recently watched The Shawshank Redemption. To put it simply as possible, it is a great piece of movie history.This movie deserves to be where it is (second)on the best Two hundred and fifty greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption is basically about a prisoner, who is in Shawshank prison because of a murder which he didn't commit. The prisoner is a banker called Andy dufresne. As the film shows Andy is a honest man. Andy is also a committed man. Andy is acted by Tim Robbins. Andy Dufresne makes a strong friendship with a man nicknamed Red. Red is acted by Morgan Freeman. I think this movie is on of the best I've ever seen I would rate it 9 out of 10.	9
 a superb and moving film.	"I stopped to see Shawshank when I was driving through Cincinnati. The theater was speckled with moviegoers.. all unaware of what an incredible cinematic achievement they were about to witness. There wasn't the slightest sound from the audience....they were mesmerized. The Jail(was in Mansield,Oh./now torn down), the music, the fantastic performances from a slew of great actors, Whitmore as Brooks, Robbins as Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman as Red,..they all did a spectacular job. This is a film(one of the few)...that will leave it's audience in tears of happiness. The narration from Freeman is written with care and this film is crafted and paced with a precision that Hollywood hasn't seen in a long, long, time. ""I hope to see the Pacific...I hope it is as blue as it is in my dreams"". This film addresses many moral trust issues....from being raped in jail, to finding a friend amongst criminals, to being unjustly incarcerated and then shunned when you prove your innocence..""how could you be so obtuse?"".....in the end it is the simplest thing, friendship, that is synonymous with freedom. This was the last time I was in a theater that cheered at the credits....and the only time an audience...so small in numbers...ever did that. One of my top 5 favorite films of all-time. 98/100"	10
 One of the best films of all time?	I am just here stroking the ego of one of the greatest films of all time its not really a useful comment but I am sure there will be plenty of useful ones out there. I can't give it 10, its not within me to give any film a 10 seeing as nothing is perfect, and moments of this film did seem a little unbelievable...Its a great story, great acting blah blah blah the film industry is not dead as long as for every Michael Bay film coming out their is a film like this in existenceget it and watch it but don't show it to kids because it depicts suicide and violence and they might go out and kill someone......	9
 Probably the best film ever!	One of my personal best films of all time, Directed by Frank Darabont (Screenplay for The Green Mile and The Blob) and wrote by Stephen King (Misery/The Shining). Morgan Freeman (Along Came A Spider/Se7en) plays an amazing roll alongside Tim Robbins (War of the Worlds/mystic river), as 2 inmates both serving life sentences at Shawshank Prison set in the 1940s. I love the film from beginning to end. It has tension and suspense all the way through which builds up to one of the best endings which you could possibly imagine,it has everything a decent film should have. Bob Gunton (Broken Arrow/Demolition Man) plays a tough prison warden alongside Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers/The Hurricane). I have not added anything to this review which may spoil the film in any way, it is merely a review of my own, personal opinion, but i can tell you that you will not be disappointed with the film. thanks for reading, hope you enjoy the film has much as i did.	10
 Strong values with a lightning screenplay by Darabont		10
 My 12 year old daughter raved about this film	"I just saw this movie for the first time. My daughter watched it first when she was 12 when it first came out. She went on and on about it saying how great it was then in about 1995. She also loved ""Trading Places"". I guess the moral of both of these stories is that the good guys win in the end. I now know what she was talking about. It is a great movie, and I can see why it appeals to women.The movie is set in a prison, with the time old tradition of a close friendship over many years of an innocent young man as the hero and an ""old lag"" who knows all the ropes, in this case Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. This is the same formula earlier used in the films ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and ""An Innocent Man"", both films which are highly recommended, if you liked this one.The film, although made in 1994, goes back to a time when good wins out over evil. unfortunately the fashion for a long time in the nineties movies was for bad to win out, as in ""the Terminator"" and other movies. The bad guys are as usual the prison boss, The Warder and his Second in Command, the Uniformed Chief Officer. There is a highly unusual twist at the end of the movie, in which the good guys win out. This is a highly improbable situation, but fantasy is allowable in movies. One character of note is that of an old man, played by James Whitmore, who rescues a tiny bird, and nurtures it for years. Thank goodness it doesn't get killed by some other evil person, as usually happens. The old man has to cope with pressures in the outside after he is released.The overarching theme of the movie is one of hope. No matter how bad things get, there is always hope that thing will get better. It also shows that it is possible to have a friendship between black and white people, as the older man, the main character's friend, is a black man. The thing that this movie gave me, is that I can see how wise my daughter already was at 12 years of age, and more importantly, it gives hope and a good philosophy for the rest of my life. I'm sure that it will do the same for those of you who see this movie too.I am unsure as to whether it deserves to be rated the best movie of all time. However movies with hope and goodness as their main themes are generally up there, take ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Schindler's List"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" as examples of this."	10
 A beautiful movie	Back in high school, I had an English class where we read the short story by Stephen King and then watched the movie. The short story is wonderfully to read by itself. However, the movie manages to both perfectly capture the whole feel and atmosphere of the original story, and improve upon it. It is rare for a movie to be better than the book, yet everyone agreed it was so. In the movie, many of the characters are more developed, and the warden is made much more crooked. Much of the narration is directly from the short story, but the parts that are not blend perfectly. It is a long movie, with little action and no special effects, yet it is always mesmerizing and beautiful, a movie about hope, with an incredible surprise ending. I still feel cheated because I read the story first and knew the ending before I ever saw the movie.	10
 Not your usual Stephen King story		9
 Perfecter Then Everything!		10
 The Greatest Movie Of All Time	"This is the greatest movie of all time! I'm not joking! The Godfather is good, but this movie is beyond any other movie!Each and every movie ever made has to bow down to this amazing, moving, grasping and beautiful movie! It's story is greater than Forrest Gump, it's actors are greater than Marlon Brando and Al Pacino and Casablanca, it's story is greater than Star Wars(Of course the old ones!)! This is the movie should have one higher number when you vote, because it's greater than a 10, even an 11. It's the most touching story in the story of the movie industry. If you haven't seen this one, you have no idea of what you are missing! This is not a must see picture, this is the most see picture! You'll never regret watching this movie, never!Movies can hold you prisoner. But only ""The Shawshank Redemption"" can set you free. Only Shawshank Redemption, forever!"	10
 True brilliance	There aren't many films that have as much of an emotional pull on you than the Shawshank Redemption does. Emotions flood through and through as you watch this movie. One second it's sadness the next it's a feeling of optimism and hope. A movie which solely takes place in a prison is one of the most inspiring pieces of art to ever be released. A film which features a brilliant screenplay by Frank Darabont, astonishing performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins, an amazing score by Thomas Newman, delightful cinematography and camera work, and a film featuring some of the greatest and inspiring themes ever seen in a film. One of the only films to ever bring me to tears, this beautiful film will stay with you forever and leave you thinking of life, and the possibility of wondrous things to come.	10
 The best movie you will see in your life	The Shawshank Redemption is by far the best movie I've seen in my life. It has it all. The acting is superb and that is not just a complement every single actor that appears in this movie gave probably the best acting that they could give. The story is very rough and hard, being life in prison and all, and yet it's touching, you see the leading character, Andy, never giving up, sticking to his story even when the world seems to turn its back on him. Inside He finds that hope is the only thing that's gonna make him go on, wake up everyday. Very nice message that the movie gives you. Also the way the friendships works, the commitment, the way they stick together and help each other, very beautiful, very beautiful. So great directing, great story, great acting, EXCELLENT MOVIE! Make yourselves a favor and go rent this movie, I promise it won't let you down.	10
 Aspiring objectivist empiricist made empathetic to subjective existence by this work of art.		10
 Overrated but still a fine film	Top 250 material - YES #1 movie of all time - not a chance in Hell.I saw this movie when I was like 14 or 15 and thought it was the greatest film ever made. Great acting, great story, great subplots, best Stephen King adaptation ever, Morgan Freeman. The things that bother me most now are the one-dimensional characters of the warden and guards. If we could see what turned them from human beings into what they are now, that would have been helpful to the emotional atmosphere of the film. The warden was definitely one of the central characters and I didn't quite get a sense of who he was.Still a fantastic film, but I can think of 100 better ones.	8
 One of the Greatest, Most Powerful, Uplifting, and Wonderful Pieces of Cinema Ever Conceived	"This is in my opinion, tied with Goodfellas for the greatest ever made. Masterfully conceived and directed by Frank Darabont, a powerfully adapted story from Stephen King's short story, amazing acting, and one of the best musical scores ever written made this movie one of the handful of masterpieces that will never die. Along with Goodfellas losing Best Picture, choosing Forest Gump(a great movie) over the Shawshank Redemption was the biggest mistake they ever made. The movie that makes many references to redemption and hope is like Jesus himself. The film did poorly in the box office but has enjoyed one of the greatest afterlives in the history of cinema.Plot: The story is taken from Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" and Frank Darabont made one of the only movies better than the source material. Masterfully crafted to start with a depressing image of everything the film goes to make one of the most uplifting, happy, and powerful endings in the history of film.Acting: Narrating is Morgan Freeman who gives an Oscar-Worthy performance as Red a lifer for murder in The Shawshank State Prison. Tim Robbins likewise gives a powerful performance as the sympathetic Andy Dufresne a lifer for murder as well. Playing the cold and ruthless Mr. Norton the Warden is Bob Gunton who creates one of the greatest villains I've ever seen on screen.Quality: This film is one of the greatest ever. One of the things that really made this film was probably one of the best, most uplifting and powerful musical scores I've ever heard which also deserved an Oscar. The camera work was also fantastic opening with a sky-view of the prison.This is one of the few movies where if you don't see the genius of it I will have to question if you really seen the entire film or any of the film. This is along with Goodfellas the greatest movies ever. There are only a handful of masterpieces in history and this is one of them. Even less is the amount of films that will never die and will always stand the test of time. This is one of them. This is a film that you should just buy.11/10"	10
 The ONLLY Perfect Movie	"The film tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), an educated banker sentenced to life for the murder of his wife and her lover. In prison, Andy inspires his fellow inmates with his courage and humanity and has a profound effect on Red (Morgan Freeman), an older prisoner, who has given up hope.Unlike many films of the 90's, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has ""high concept"" plot premise and is somewhat episodic compared with the tight, linear narratives of closer structured pictures. This sense of freedom in the storytelling allows the film to consistently throw up genuine surprises, as the viewer isn't constantly on guard for clues and plot points. In hindsight, we tend to forget how successfully director Frank Darabont leads us to expect a very different resolution.""The Shawshank Redemption"" does things well that you might not expect. It has lengthy voice-overs (that actually work well) and it has a sappy predictable ending, but yet these elements work because they are not placed in the over-used, meaningless context that movies today place them in. The voice overs are also consistently used in such a way that distinct worlds are created. There's a real world inside the prison and the surreal outside world.These two distinct worlds are created help to place the viewer inside the halls of the prison, they are no longer watching a movie, but they are also feeling it.This is a movie that will remain a favorite of the people for many decades to come. 10/10"	9
 A movie you can watch over and over again	I'm new to this so don't beat me up. I have seen this movie so may times I can not count. If it is on I'll get hooked into watching and I know I may have seen the beginning of the movie twice. Morgan and Tim friendship in the movie is what makes this movie click. It give us a good idea on what prison life was like in the 50ish years. I would assume in some aspect in prison life a lot has changed, but some stay the same. I'm a sucker for these type of movie that goes through a time line in peoples lives. I tend to want to know my characters in a movie then speed through not knowing a small history of the character It is on my top 20 must see!!!	9
 Brilliant	The movie is the best I have seen so far.It is absolutely flawless.The direction is brilliant,the cast is star-studded and the cinematography is awesome.I give full marks to Frank Darabont for directing a film which made me and everybody else feel touched.The film never bores u or makes u feel sleepy.Every minute of the movie is filled with excitement.The film is begun very well and also ends brilliantly with no crap in the middle of the movie.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman Have proved why they are one of the most enigmatic and versatile actors in Hollywood.A film like this can come only once in a century.It deserves the #1 rating among the top 250.10 out of 10 is just not enough for the film.	10
 It doesn't get better than this	What can I say, it is films like this that just give you that great feeling. This is a perfect film for themes such as hope, friendship, freedom and corruption. Now for those who have not seen the film I won't say anything, so do not worry, but just to tell you. If you are into the themes I have just mentioned, then you will love this. Tim Robbins adopts the role of Andy Dufresne as his own and Morgan freeman plays Red in an emotional and convincing manner and really did shine throughout the film. So if you want to see a film thats emotional, intellectual, violent and warden smashing, then this film is for you. It will give you chills.	10
 Absolutely the most brilliant film I've seen.	"This movie is so much more than what one would make out of it by simply looking at actors, director and plot outline. Its the synergy of all these parts that makes it one of the greatest of all time. TSR is a metaphor for all the important questions in life. The limits we set on ourselves, the ease of falling into conformity and our fear to hope for the best for our self's. The movie is about hope, in times of struggle, in times of extreme hardships and injustices, its about enduring and crawling trough all this s*** and seek the redemption outside in the soft rain from heaven. Its simply a ""to be, or not to be"". I could write cheesy metaphors all night but I'm gonna stop now. I love this movie simply because it gives me hope, its helped me trough my life's hardships, heartbreak and injustice, its helped me to get trough these times and made me love life more than life itself."	10
 My all time favorite movie! Along with Good Will Hunting!		10
 minor point	"This movie is certainly VERY well done. The plot is nice (Stephen King never fails you down) and acting is superb, in particular Tim Robbins and Bob Gunton, the director. You should see it, but in my opinion it is not very original among ""jail-movie"" and not worthy of such a high position, ranking on the IMDb's top 250 list.Another minor point which prevent the movie to get an excellent movie is the fact that all characters are ""one-dimensional stereotype"". I mean that in this movie characters can be extremely positive or extremely negative, sometimes forgetting that human beings have complex behavior."	9
 one of the best stories ever told	this movie took my breath away. it is a thought provoking, beautifully acted, gorgeously filmed, uplifting film that never disappoints. Tim Robins and Morgan both give award winning performances and it is very odd when one realizes the lack of awards this movie received. Do not let the lack of awards dissuade you though as Shawshank Redemption is quite possibly the best movie i have ever seen, i just cant emphasize how good this movie is. Please do yourself a favor and see this film right now if you haven't already. If there was one good deed that could get you into heaven then watching this movie would be it.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption (1994)	"Tim Robbins as a banker who goes to prison being accused of murdering his wife and her lover.Sentence: life in prison.Morgan Freeman is his fellow inmate ""Red"" and William Sadler is Heywood.Later a young inmate, Gil Bellows as Tommy joins in.The poster of Rita Hayworth has a big role in the film.Later it's Marilyn Monroe and finally it's Raquel Welch.Frank Darabont directed this marvelous film based on Stephen King's short story.It's one of the best movies made of King's stories.Probably the best one alongside The Shining (1980).The acting is superb.The story is fantastic.The Shawshank Redemtion is a big movie.A kind of movie we should see more often."	9
 Greatest movie of all time		10
 The best movie i have ever seen to this day.	"It is a great film because of the details that are used in the film. the thing about the story and the movie itself is it is told from Red's point of view making sure you know his opinion on it and what happened instead of having to figure it out on yourself. it, to this day is my favorite movie to watch and there will never be another movie like it in my opinion. the things that andy does go through hit you hard because you always see prisoners on TV but you never see an innocent man that you know is innocent going to jail for life. the friends he make are also very good additions that help the story and shows the corruptness of prisons in captain hadley nd the warden. there are a lot of memorable quotes in the movie also. such as ""get busy living or get busy dyin'"". the shawshank redemption shows the hardships people can go through when throws a curveball their way and how they deal with it."	10
 Great Movie - You must see it!	"The greatness of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is all the great values this film is built on - love, friendship, lending hand to another man. What is also wonderful about this film is its combination of its serious moments with the beautiful humour. In addition, the film has a third-person narrator which adds a lot of meaning to it and allows to develop a closer relationship with Red and - through Red - with Andy. As for Stephen King's story that the film is based on, it a bit disappointed me. However, after reading it I appreciated Frank Darabont's work even more - I saw how much imagination and creativity he had to use for ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Lastly, the score is so beautiful you can cry at moments, e.g. the piece accompanying the arrival of Andy's transport to the Shawshank Prison. I guess I watched this movie five times and think I will watch it many times more. I recommend it to everyone."	10
 A Story Of Survival and Hope	*The Shawshank SPOILERS* In the early '20s, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a quiet bank employee, is arrested, tried and sentenced to life in prison for the murders of his wife and her lover, murders that he didn't commit.The calm man has to rough up really soon, in order to survive life in the Shawshank prison, but manages to develop a friendship with a fellow inmate called Red (Morgan Freeman) and to be employed in the contability office by the corrupt director of Shawshank, thus helping his escape plan...When I first watched this movie, a few years ago, I was so in awe that as soon as I got out of school (where me and my classmates watched it during a morning without teachers) I went and bought it.It's an instant classic, an inspiring movie, based upon a short story by Stephen King (!), marvelously written, acted and directed, and fully deserving of being owned.The Shawshank Redemption: 10/10.	10
 An Excellent Escape	Movie right at the beginning starts showing its quality of dialogues and thats the key for bounding the viewers .Then a fine story with great actors leaves an everlasting impression. Point of life after prison is also shown with a heart touching scene.Humanity in prison is raised by another scene. Overall this movie can't be compared with others as such a style of escape can't be said to be inspired.Atlast the movie gives a message of friendship,love and hope. A way of making prisoner's life more useful to the society and how education can affect the system is suggested.Combining these all elements in a series of events is commendable.The tag line of this movie is inspiring.	10
 A very good movie, but overrated nonetheless.		8
 Not bad, but not that good	"I am totally puzzled as to why this film is so highly rated. It is reasonably well made, has a very good cast, and it held my interest. However, it has nothing new in it. It wasn't fun. It wasn't life changing. It didn't make me want to be a better person. None of the characters in the film were particularly appealing. The protagonist's method for escaping from prison was obviously not new, since he flashed his copy of ""The Count of Monte Christo."" There was an unusual directness in confronting gay rape in prison, but I find it to be not that compelling a subject. I guess that leaves redemption. To me, he paid way too high a price for thinking about, but not actually, killing his wife. After she cheated on him. Perhaps the point was that he felt so guilty about her death, he wanted to be punished. By spending twenty years getting raped in prison? That's not punishment, it's just sick."	6
 wow		10
 Absolutely blew me away.	This is definitely the best film I've ever seen.Ever What pulled me in is how much you start to feel for these characters as if their real people. Another thing that I liked is how the characters change for example Andy(main character) at the start hes a healthy looking man and after 20 years he has grey hairs bags under his eyes and a broken spirit.In the end you don't care what happens to the warden you don't care if he becomes president as long as Andy escapes.In truth this is a love story but not a regular love story this is A story of two of the most unlikely candidates.There's Andy a hardworking lawyer and then there's red sent to prison at the age of 18 for murder and armed robbery two polar opposites but in the end they might as well be family.This is the single most powerful movie ever at the end I was crying something that has never happened before anyway this is a film to see before you die words cant honestly explain how great this film is you have to see it.	10
 Possibly the best movie ever to be made!!!	"I personally think that the way this movie touches me cannot be put into words. The core of this movie is hope: hope that overcomes every obstacle placed in your way, the knowing that the wronged people in life can triumph over evil. This is what Andy Dufresne achieves, and the tag line of ""Fear can hold you prisoner, hope can set you free"" is perfect The underlying theme is friendship, and Andy and Reds friendship is perfectly portrayed here by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. They are both fine actors, and I feel here they give career best performances(although Morgan Freeman is generally good in everything). Morgan Freeman should of won an Oscar for his subtle approach to this role - surely his million dollar baby Oscar is a belated one for this movie too? The directing, the story and everything combine to make this a special movie - don't worry, the ratings in the all time list, which always put this movie in the top 5, are not wrong. This is a movie everyone must see!!!"	10
 A flawless masterpiece? I'd say so.		10
 Can a film get better the more you see it?	"I do think some films get better the more you view them. ""Shawshank"" is such a film. Whever I stumble across it on a cable channel, I am simply unable to break away from it, even though I've seen it a dozen times. The best films are ""simple stories, well told."" From the script, to the acting, to the direction, to the sets, and - most importantly - in its message, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is absolutely first-rate. It's always fun to see a wronged man win in the end, but in this story it is the manner in which Andy prevails that is so gripping. The scene in which Tim Robbins as Andy ponders if he is in some way responsible for his fate because of his thoughts is amazing. And Morgan Freeman's greatest film moment comes when he faces the parole board one more time. Most movies blow from your mind minutes after the final credits, this one stays with you forever. I'm ready to see it again."	9
 Extraordinary!	i've seen the top 50 films in the IMDb top 250 category and a number of times I've felt that a movie wasn't worth its ranking. the shawshank redemption fits this bill in not being placed number one. and this coming from a die-hard god father fan must surely mean something. the storyline, the cinematography and the acting are all masterpieces in their own right. the story of a wronged person accepting his fate and then changing it is remarkable, for everyone relates to it, though maybe not to the extent portrayed here. kudos to stephen king and frank darabont and the actors for a great movie. its a real pity that it won no Oscars. this is one movie i would have hated to miss. truly exceptional.	10
 A Truly Wonderful Movie	"*spoilers*The first time I saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"",I was simply blown away by how powerful this movie is. There are no action sequences or romances, but the subtle drama of a man who is wrongly accused is easily identifiable, possibly because we realize that it could happen to anyone. What makes the main character (Andy Dufrene) find the strength to survive his term of life in prison is his knowledge of his innocence, and his friendship with Red, a convicted murderer, who is slowly reforming throughout the movie. The end of the movie is perhaps one of the most uplifting scenes I have ever watched, as justice finally prevails, due to Andy's determination and careful planning.I never get tired of this movie. From the beginning of the movie where Andy considers murder, to his incarceration for that same murder(ironically committed by someone else), and his long stay in prison under a cruel warden, and finally the best-ever use of a Raquel Welch art poster. Ever.I highly encourage this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it. It is a classic, and the acting is superb. Even smallest roles are memorable."	10
 An amazing prison tale of how people can get threw the toughest times if they stay together	This is one of the best stories of freedom in the world. It shows how the human heart can work to get you out of the worst situations. Sure i never cried during watching it but it made me feel good.This movie tells a tale back in 1949, a man is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover(sound familiar 'Green Mile'/Stephen King fans?). Of course with all Stephen King's twisted books/movies... he didn't do it but he is sent to prison anyway. Since prisoners were thought of lesser human in the 40's-70's if you were caught doing something you weren't suppose to(or if yo u just annoy the guards) you are beaten badly. Luckily Andy Dufrense makes acquaintances with the warden and guards. He makes friends with 'Red' Redding(Nicely done by Morgan Freeman), a man who can get you anything from the outside. They bond together with other inmates and conquer over the warden. BUT one day a new inmate comes in and tells the story of how he knows Andy is instant.The rest people can figure out for their own but they have to be careful... though this is one of Stephen King's rare dramas, it will have the evilness and twists that we all love him for. Plus look for the most feel good ending in the world. I'm honest this ending will shock you so much and make you want to know more of what happened.	10
 inspirational, uplifting and a worthy top ten film ever	am i one of the few who watched this at a cinema? Watched at the now closed Odeon, Haymarket on a Wednesday when I had nothing better to do and know very little about the film apart from a Geordie mate kept raving about it. With limited expectations, I came out totally enthralled by a magnificent cinematic experience - one that you all too rarely enjoy. To me you have to take inspiration from Defrene; no matter how tough your situation is, you need to focus on what you want to achieve and retain the belief that your dreams can come true. The scene on top of the roof, drinking beer is tops. Only wish I knew where my son has posted the DVD! We have to watch it on video now!	10
 Best movie I've ever seen	I don't want to say anything about the movie. I'm sure that you will enjoy it as much as I did. There are a lot of movies showing prison breaks but by far this one is the best not by the idea of the escape but by the message that this movie is sending. Once you've seen it you will feel different. I didIf you like Prison Break, if you liked Escape from Alcatraz you definitely want to see this movie.Tim Robbins is doing an extraodrinary job and the screenplay is awesome. For sure 2 hours well spent in my life. And not only one ;)If you can grab the 2004 release. Almost every error and goofs were fixed so you'll get the better version of it !	10
 Shawshank is one of the greatest films ever made, a classic.		10
 PURE Brilliance	"A heartbreaking story fraught with Passion, Loss, A Dream, and Friendship. There's only so much i can say about a film that is loved by millions and yet misunderstood by more. It's the visual version of a musical ballad. A soft and thoughtful piece and yet created by a hard centre and churned by the brilliant hands of Frank Darabont and the great acting of both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. A True Classic.""Andy Dufresne, is sent to Shawshank Prison for the murder of his wife and secret lover. He is very isolated and lonely at first, but realises there is something deep inside your body, that people can't touch and get to....'HOPE'. Andy becomes friends with prison 'fixer' Red (Morgan Freeman), and Andy epitomises why it is crucial to have dreams. His spirit and determination, leads us into a world full of imagination, filled with courage and desire. Will Andy ever realise his dreams...?"""	10
 This is possibly the best film ever made.	This is possibly the best film ever made. Everything from the script and acting to the camera work and set are remarkable. Based on a Stephen King novella, it is easily the best adaption from a written story ever put to film. Tim Robbin's certainly deserved an Oscar for this film, his performance was moving yet not overpowering. Even though the audience is left out of the story in certain parts, we still feel strongly for his character Andy Dufresne. Morgan Freeman is perfect, even though he's not the Irishman that was intended for the role. He narrates the film with ease and we connect to his character as if we were a part of the movie. Frank Darabont, director of the film, allowed us to feel what Andy was feeling through the use of small stories and camera shots. The immensity of the prison can be felt instantly from our first viewing. The connection the audience makes to the film as a whole makes The Shawshank Redemption what it is: one of the best films ever made.	10
 only movie I've ever cried while watching.		10
 Best movie ever!		10
 If only there were more films like this	After watching useless film after useless film, I always come back to this. It acts as a benchmark and I must remind myself to watch it more as I find myself become more accommodating to the rubbish which is being released these days. How many films do you find yourself counting the minutes till the end or where the media has created a publicity storm to cloak the fact their film isn't worth the huge budget they spent on it? After watching King Kong at Christmas I felt depressed, as here was a truly bloated, poorly acted, lazily directed, piece of film which was getting rave reviews from the critics and public alike. Please feel free to argue against me, but the fact that so few are willing to state the obvious, that the film wasn't great, just alright at best, highlights a continuing trend in todays society, that of applauding mediocrity.	10
 A wallop packed story	"This film really got me. As soon as Morgan Freeman got into the movie, I started to get interested and the film ended up to be a crowd cheer and a tearjerker. The story is so well done. This movie is based on Stephen Kings short novel ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption.""Vice president of the Portland bank Andy Dufrane (Tim Robbins) goes to jail for two life sentences he did not commit. When he goes to jail, the first step onto the prison ground will change his life. When he's been beaten around by the queer bull Diamond brothers, he decides to wait a few years to escape. Before these years he decides to meet the institutionalized prisoner Red (Morgan Freeman) who can get Andy or other prisoners whatever they wanted. He can get you packs of cigarettes, jack hammers, naked lady cards, and posters of Rita Hayworth, Marilyn Monroe etc. Andy wanted a jack hammer to crack his wall. Red promised Andy that if the guards find his hammer, they will never do business again. Andy never got caught and Red and him both became friends for a long time. Andy became a big hit for the prisoners and the guards when he helped them with their tax problems. In exchange he got the prisoners beers. After he got the prison library to expand. That is most of what I can say about 'The Shawshank Redemption.'Why did this film not win any academy awards? I felt this film was a lot better than the brutally charged 'Pulp Fiction' than Tom Hanks life achievements as 'Forrest Gump.' This picture sees life more beautifully and more possible. This is a great luminous character study of fortitude and friendship behind bars at its finest."	10
 You'd be Obtuse not to Appreciate This Fable		9
 The best movie made yet	Every time I watch this movie Its like watching it for the first time. Everything about it works the characters the story and the direction. This movie should be number 1 on IMDb.com. Tim Robbins gives an excellent performance and Andy a man accused and sent to prison for killing his wife a man she was having an affair with. Robbins provides a subtle quality to his character which has a lot of depth though not entirely apparent on the surface you can tell it is there. Morgan Freeman Plays the character red as well as narration for the story. His voice provides a very powerful way of pushing the story forward which combined with an excellent score finishes off the movie and makes it a must see for anyone.	10
 deakins	beautiful overhead shot of prison. Roger Deakins is a god. king has never been treated so soft or tenderly. dialogue is sentimental. Too so? yeah. music is smooth and sweet. the over-all posture stood is unexpectedly tough. green mile was a sad shadow of this previous vastly superior effort.the Brooks Hatlen interlude was a welcome beat. meandering is a virtue. i get lost in it's world for a sec. which is rare. the ending makes me cry. freeman is an exceedingly wonderful actor. strange feelings of elation near ending as if something has occurred. Things which haven't. magic of pure Hollywood-style cinema. samo	10
 THE BEST MOVIE IN HISTORY ! If you like to see movies, go see this first !		
 No way does this belong in the top 250....	Shawshank IS a very good film but it has too many cliché characters and situations AND script holes that one can drive a truck through. Gee, this must be from a Stephen King story. Actually, it's from two of his short stories. With King its often quantity and not quality. Despite that, The Shawshank Redemption is worthwhile.What this film does have is terrific performances from the entire cast and a sense that an honest man can remain honest, despite the worst of circumstances. The scenes with the great character actor James Whitmore, especially those of his trying to cope after his release, are very well done.The last ten minutes is splendid and almost redeems the rest of the picture. It gives this film an 8 instead of a 6 in my scale.	8
 Get busy living get busy dying!		10
 views	I simply cannot understand why this film is so highly regarded. I wanted to watch it because it had such a good write-up, was long, had great actors and sounded interesting. And it was... relatively interesting. But probably a slightly better than average film. Like 'The Green Mile' it should have been better. It was not emotional or harrowing enough. There was some silly part of the film that descended into a fiscal documentary!!!? 'Patch Adams' is much better. The most interesting theme was that prisoners become totally institutionalised and there were some good moments but overall it was a bit too clichéd. It would have been better with a more satisfying finale and a cracking, string-led score from James Horner or Hans Zimmer.	8
 Greatest Movie		10
 Shawshank Redemption	"This movie is the greatest prison movie I have ever seen. The storyline is original and the performance of Tim Robbins is superb. The movie is about Andy Dufresne is convicted of the double murder of his wife and her lover and tells the story of his double life sentence behind bars at Shawshank prison which uses religion as a form of rehabilitation. During his sentence he is bashed constantly for three years until he meets a fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding who is asked by Dufresne to help him escape. With his escape comes the signature scene as Andy escapes through the sewers to freedom. The end of the film highlights the ability of two friends to overcome adversity to achieve a central goal. The screenplay is superb as this is based on the novel by one of the best or the best horror of all time, Stephen King. The movie is a movie that explores the REAL story behind bars and the ability of people to escape mentally and spiritually with rehabilitation"	10
 One of the most thought provoking films I have ever seen.	Watched The Shawshank Redemption again this evening - what a wonderful story from beginning to end and. I was intrigued at the end of the credits to see that the film was dedicated to Allan Greene. Does anyone know who he was? I would be grateful for any information. I found the story within this film demonstrated the human feelings of despair,helplessness ; anger going on to forward thinking, planning and hope. Hope that a human being could overcome the corruption and cruelty by being a lot more clever than the those who only sought to deal in the destruction of the soul. The tenacity of a man able to withstand 20 years chipping away with a rock hammer in order to attempt freedom in a place where freedom was a word never even contemplated.	10
" reismark's remarks about film, and ""renting"" versus library"	I wholeheartedly agree with reismark's review of the film. It is excellent. I want to note, however, as the treasurer of a library system, that people should remember that rental and purchasing are not the only options. If you learn about your local libraries, you'll find that many of them, perhaps most of them, have collections of video on VHS and DVD which rival rental stores. In most instances, these materials circulate without charge, although some libraries charge a nominal fee to rent very recent titles. In the library system to which I belong, even rental titles are potentially available free, since we insist that there must be at least ONE copy in the system which circulates without a fee.	10
 A Triumph of the Human Spirit	I saw this movie at the end of a particularly bad and miserable day in my life and it is safe to say that I was not particularly looking forward to this one.Two and a half hours later I was on my feet again and was once more prepared to look the world in the eyes. Such is the power of this movie.Tim Robbins plays a sincere man who is sent to to jail for a crime he did not commit. Inside, he meets extraordinary human beings, all of who you will fall in love with within minutes of meeting them. Chief among these is the character of Red, played by none other than the legendary Morgan Freeman.Together with Andy and Red you learn about life and friendship and the evils inherent in human nature. You laugh with them, are sad with them and feel their pain, and in the end, when the two friends meet again on a remote beach years later, you finally break down and cry with them.This movie is emotionally powerful and reminds us once again what the movies should be.It is not sentimental in any way, and that is a rarity these days. And if you do not feel sad, and your heart does not beat faster with Morgan Freeman's soliloquoy at the end, you cannot call yourself human. For, then, you have missed one of the greatests gifts one can receive: a passion for life.	9
 Great prison drama		9
 A Very Important Film		10
 Flawless	This movie is perfect in construction, with just the right amount of feel-goodiness added but not so much as to make one wretch. A portrait of the strength of the human spirit, and the awesome power of hope. I love the feeling of hope that this movie inspires in the viewer. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love it (still awaiting the DVD's return as I lent it to a friend about 4 months ago!) The only negative comment I've ever heard about it is the ending. Some die-hards think the movie should end with Red in the coach on his way to find Andy, but not show their meeting on the beach as its too corny. I disagree. I think that after the whole battle to escape, and wondering if they will etc, people needed the closure that seeing them meet offered. If they'd hugged and cried that would have been too much for me, but it was done perfectly. With Red, casually strolling down the beach towards Andy and starting to laugh. I'm getting goose-bumps just thinking about it now.My favourite movie.	10
 Get busy living. Or get busy dying.		10
 Capra-esqe Prison Yarn A Huge Cult Hit		10
 Without any thought, the best movie i have ever seen	One night when i was browsing through the channels and my dad was doing laundry. The Shawshank Redemption came up and he said it was one of his favorite films. I had no idea why until i watched it. The movies performances, specifically Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, are both incredibly complex and are both Oscar quality. The set of the prison and supporting cast and extras are all masterfully organized. The story is crisp and original, and has deep emotion to it. This movie received 7 Oscar nominations and won none, i believe because Forrest Gump stole all the thunder. But if it were my choice, The Shawshank Redemption would have won Best Picture and is in my mind the best film i have ever seen.	10
 *speechless*		10
 Best movie ever made	Best movie ever made. From the beginning to the end this movie is so perfect it's hard to put it into words, every little detail is stunning. Maybe my opinion is not the most objective because this has been my favorite movie for quite some time, but however, I remembered the first time I saw it. I could't get it of my mind for a couple of days. And still, after seeing it over 20 times, I often think about it and smile. The part when Andy escapes and the next 30 minutes after that you can't stop smiling, it's so perfect. The biggest star must go to Morgan Freeman who gives this movie even more deep and feeling. To everyone who haven't seen it yet, do it, you will not regret it.	10
 average movie at best and full of clichés	why is this movie considered a classic....someone please make a reasonable argument to explain this.I've seen it several times and my opinion of it remains the same. nothing special about the direction,cinematography is only OK, acting is good, screenplay is inferior to an already average short story (film is nearly 3 hrs long....totally up its own anus) and it contains every prison film cliché in the book. people like it because of its triumph over adversity theme (man winning against impossible odds, human spirit unbroken......zzzzzzzzzzzz) its been done b4 especially in Hollywood and much better (cuckoos nest).this AVERAGE movie has got to be near the top of the list of most overrated films ever made.	
 The Best Movie I've Ever seen	I was very impressed by this movie. At first I wasn't sure if I should rent it or not but I gave it a try and it is the best movie I've ever seen. The acting is very good, the plot very good, and just the right amount of drama, comedy, and sadness is included. The movie doesn't leave you wanting more like some OK movies, It finishes just how it should. After seeing this I guarantee you'll think the money was worth it. I would would definitely give this a 10 out of 10 hands down and judging by its excellent rating on this site, others share the same opinion. I personally wish I could see it again for the first time as it is just great! Enjoy!	10
 Simply put, a masterpiece.		10
 Shaw shank Redemption......simply the best!!!!	I have to say that Shawshank is THE best film i have ever seen, it was recommended to me by a friend and i have been recommending it to all and sundry ever since. You simply haven't lived until you have seen this movie and although i loved every character in this movie, Morgan freeman definitely did it for me. It leaves you realising that after a long time in prison, it must be extremely intimidating to be set free in what is a crazy world and leaving a hard but familiar life behind. I have never been to prison and never want to but its quite an insight I'm sure to how you develop a routine and a life in there. If you only ever want to see one movie in your time then make this the one, if i was doing desert island discs, then this would be the movie i take with me without a doubt. And as for which movie actor i would take with me, well thats easy.....that has to be Morgan Freeman (Red) Cheers Sarah	10
 Greatest movie of all time....	This for me is the best movie of all time because it shows companionship through out the movie between the two main characters (andy and red). It's true to life with the little details of when it was set and the story was genius, great twist at the end when he reveals the hole in the wall, great stuff, your rooting for Andy the whole time as we all know he is innocent. He gets his revenge in the end by out smarting the person who over looks the prison, which for me is the best part of the movie. The three sister also shine a light on how desperate in mates can get, and Red shows the craft of an experienced prisoner smuggling small goods for the rest, he takes Andy under his wing and tells him moral after moral. Great movie, i can watch it over and over again, which, normally i cant with most long movies, but this is one movie that is something that little extra special. Watch it!!!!	10
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"""		10
 Hope is'nt always the first step on the road to disappointment.	"***SPOILERS***This is a great movie that shows us that hope is a great thing. The story tells us about Andy Dufrense, a man who is falsely accused for killing his wife and her lover and who gets sent to Maines strongest prison. Shawshank. In Shawshank Andy gets new friends, as well as enemies. Being the wise man that he is, he begins to inject wisdom in people. Helping them. He also meets Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding. A man also accused for murder, but on true accusations. They become great friends and together they give themselves hope. This is a wonderful movie that leaves you happy and shaken. Its an must see."	10
 Hands down, the greatest film ever		10
 Simply the best!		10
 Most wonderful movie ever !	"The Shawshank Redemption. Somehow for Americans it was a difficult name for a movie to get used to. From the first time I saw it, I have never forgotten it. A story of hope, friendship, perseverance. Shawshank immediately struck a chord deep within me. I think many people that have seen it and rate it very highly, will share this feeling. I have always been a big movie-fan and to the question ""which is the best movie ever"", I could never give an answer without summing up some 3-4 different ones. But over the years my answer has become formed and now whenever I get asked that question I can honestly say ""The Shawshank Redemption""."	10
 The best movie ever made. Period.	I don't know how many times I've seen this film, and it still is as entertaining as it's ever been. The directing is excellent. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are the best choices for their respective rolls, and the story makes you wonder why Steven King ever wrote a horror novel to begin with. Even the trailer to this movie is probably one of the best I've ever seen.This is one of those movies that I've unwittingly been recruited as a salesperson for. In other words, I feel I need to show this movie to all my friends and family who haven't seen it, and I'm more than willing to watch it again. If you love this movie as much as I do, then don't forget to watch the younger brother of this film, The Green Mile. Written and directed by the same crew. It's a great film, but has a lot to live up to.	10
 A Film that will touch your soul	"I read this novella in Stephen Kings ""Four Seasons"" while i was doing my GCSE exams. i remember then what a profound effect the story had on me. A story of hope through extreme adversity and the power of friendship that i thought could not be found between two men. The sheer anticipation of this film being released was almost heart stopping, but coupled with the fear it would not live up to my expectations. i also remember thinking that i did not want to see it for fear of it shattering my own perceptions of the two main characters, ANDY and RED. i need not have feared a thing.....the screenplay and adaptation was done with nothing short of pure brilliance. the camera work and choice of location could not have been more suitable. perhaps it is a symbol of how well Mr King writes that, it seems, everyones picture of everything is the same!!! Thus is was quite easy to choose sets, locations and of course actors. In the book, RED is a white, Irish man......against all odds, i cannot imagine ANYONE else delivering such a captivating, believable and utterly brilliant performance as Morgan Freeman. This man deserves 20 Oscars his acting together with the small stabs of narration are mind blowing who else could have done this?!! NO-ONE!! Tim Robbins IS ANDY!....his whole movement and attitude were exactly what King had written, this was encompassed in Robbins' portrayal perfectly. together the chemistry they had was beautiful, you could see that these characters were good friends, as well as the actors that played them. The visionary pieces of the film that will always linger? well the whole film lingers, such was the effect it had on me, but the two specific points in the film? Firstly, Andy described to RED where he could find a box, near a tree in a field, under some rocks to be exact. Now this bit is in the book (obviously!!) but i remember when i read it, the picture of that tree, in that field, next to that wall. In the film it was as if they had asked ME to choose the location, a chill went down my spine and it nearly brought me to tears!!! and i am NOT KIDDING!!!!. The second bit, well its right at the end, its the smile on RED's face when he sees ANDY again. This is not a feeble lip turning grin.....NO this is a full , both sets of teeth, cheek aching smile!!!! it IS the biggest and most emotional smile i have ever seen in any film. i could go on for pages about this film, i have been a film fan ever since i can remember, sitting with my father on a Sunday afternoon (before the times of VCR's or satellite, when you watched what was on that day or tough!!!) we watched films like ""The African Queen"", ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Rear Window"", etc and from then i always liked a good film with a good story, The Shawshank Redemption was already a good story, it took genius to make it a GREAT film. to date i have seen it over 100 times. this has taken me through 3 copies on Video before the DVD came out, i am now on my 2nd DVD. if i have to buy another 100 DVD's it will always always alway be my number one favourite film of all time. It is a film you can watch at any time, when you are in any mood and it is still as compelling as the first time i saw it, or indeed the first time i read the story. 20 out of 10........"	10
 I miss my friend	"In the 11 years since the release and realization of the brilliance of this film, I'm sure many, many legions of people have written reviews that summarily praise (and viscously, ignorantly degrade - you know who you are, those whose reviews appear under the ""hated"" tag on the reviews pages) and criticize the movie. I can't add anything that hasn't been said before, except just say how much this movie affected me and how much I love it. Tim Robbins, always a great actor, and always very, very human. Morgan Freeman, c'mon, who da man? Who da MAN?!?!? HE DA MAN!!! He DA MAN!!! He DA smooth-walkin', smoother-talking', illest muthaf***in' epitome of ""cool"". And not a bad actor, either, heh heh (yes, I know I am drastically understating that fact). The direction - flawless. Every shot, every camera angle, every color tone (plus the quality of the film and the cameras themselves) embody such finesse, such power. Humanity! That's what the word I was looking for, the word that describes what every frame overwhelmingly emanates, even during the ""brutal"" scenes (I put ""brutal"" in quotes because I unfortunately have seen plenty of sick s@%* in my life and am now sadly desensitized to movie violence; violence on the news and in real life though, DAMN I get sickened and angered at perpetrators). The very human friendship twixt the leads are very well handled, never turning into cutesy schmaltz or soap-y melodrama. The writing. Yes, I know. ""How the hell does his cell open up into a pipe drain? That's horrible plot!!!!!!"" Ask yourselves: If his cell wall didn't open up over the pipe, would he have escaped? Would the story have been the same AT ALL if his cell opened up anywhere else other than that river of s@%*? And then think about Andy. Would someone of his intelligence would have discontinued his digging and succumbed to madness if what he saw when he looked through the initial tiny hole on the other side was anything other than a road to freedom? Convenient plot twist? Sure! But not outlandish. It could happen (not like a New York Cop winning a $4M lottery ticket and tipping a waitress half, no matter how much he wanted to get with her). Very good storytelling and very tight screen writing. This movie is great. Plain and simple. It did confirm one thing in general to me, though, especially in these times of moral conflict that is dividing the ""greatest nation on the face of the earth"" bitterly: Those who thump the bible the hardest, usually cling to it the hardest out of fear and out of guilt. Love this film."	10
 Wonderful!	This is simply a film that you would struggle to find a flaw with. The performances are wonderful, the story is involving and deep, the characters are likable and understandable, and the whole climax to the story is satisfying and rewards you for having stayed the course. It's funny, it's moving, and it presents an incredible perception on the ideas of hope, freedom and the vibrancy of the human spirit.If you haven't seen this film yet, then go out, rent a copy, and watch it. If you have a friend who hasn't seen it either, then invite them round - believe me, they'll thank you for it. This is one film that really is a must-see.	10
 The best movie ever	Another non-award winning movie that is consider one of the best movies ever made I loved this movie and can watch it over all the time Should have one best picture not just one brilliant but two brilliant performances by both Tim and Morgan this movie is great can,t say that enough but ill hold off if you haven't seen this movie your not a movie lover you don't know what your missing kind of like the fugitive in a sense but better another wrongly convicted person and treated horrible in prison pulls off a brilliant exit and learns a few things while in the pen underrated at the time now its rated under a movie it should be above a must watch movie.	10
 The Shawshank Redemption...		10
 As good as drama gets		10
 Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies		10
 Possibly the best movie ever created.	Once in a while a great movie is made. In 1994, Shawshank Redemption, went up against another giant, Forrest Gump. I personally feel if it weren't for the fan appeal in that year; Shawshank would of taken best picture. If it were to go up against any movie ever created then it would easily win. Shawshank includes many twists and is depicted in a very graphic and realistic way. Once again (like all good movies) the ending is what makes this movie. The actors were awesome and quite possibly could be the movie of the century. I really can't put this movie up against any other movie and should be #1 on the top 250 list. So please vote 10 because this movie really deserves it.	10
 Amazing	After seeing The Shawshank Redemption on television, I knew I had to see the whole film. It was incredible. After that I decided to read the book, and this is one of the rare times that a film outdid the book it was based off of. Even though the ending of the book was the same (poster, escape), the film just had a certain something to it that made it amazing. Tim Robbins ad Andy is extremely captivating and he almost entirely becomes the roll of a nobody. Not just any actor can do that. I can watch this movie time and time again and to me it will never get old. The music, dialouge, acting, and plot are award-deserving parts of a film that should go down in history as a classic.	10
 Andy Dufresne brings hope to the Shawshank prison		10
 Best movie ever!		10
 Flat out one of the most jaw-droppingly amazing movies ever made.		10
 Easier one of the greatest films not to win an Oscar for best film, a truly great film	Easier one of the greatest films not to win an Oscar for best film, a truly great film. Moegan Freeman was finally awarded his long overdrew Oscar in 2005. He was not far off receiving an Oscar for his stand out role as the inmate who befriends Tim Robbens character. I think it was Forrest Gump that it lost out to in 1994 when it went up for the Oscar. And to lose out to such a film in its own right is not something to be looked shamefully on. Had it gone up in the same catorgory since then it would have more have likely have won. You would be hard pressed finding a film that has been given more complements that this, but has never received the recognition it mot truly deserves	10
 Start Livin'...again	Simply put, this is more than a movie. Sit down in the dark one night and rediscover the magic of opening up the little tin box under the old oak tree. Listen to the sounds of the lady's from Italy as they send you on a journey of musical bliss. Go numb once more as the arm goes through the wall and you learn that 'ol Andy had some business on the side that even Red wasn't aware of. And lastly, see first hand on screen how two men can have a friendship that knows only the limits that they have been confident enough to set-up for themselves. Yes, this is more than a movie. No doubt about it. For what it is, it's as perfect as a movie can be. So start livin' and smell the salt from the warm ocean blue.	10
 An easy movie to watch	Very good movie that tells a good story.Life in early 1900's prison builds some strong friendships among the inmates. Daily prison existence takes its toll on you so you do what you have to in order to make it through. Inmates learn how to make the corruption work in their favor and take full advantage of it by building on the trust the guards have in the inmates.I don't think they could have come up with a better ending to the story than what they did. This movie is a masterpiece that you will find yourself watching any time you are in the mood for a good movie.Highly recommended film. Watch it, you will be pleased.	9
 Best Movie of all-time!!!	A true masterpiece, have seen the film many times and yet every time it gets better for me.. thats a true sign of a great film.its not all about the prison break, so people getting this film to see an Escape from Alcatraz movie will be disappointed.This film is about hope and so much more. Awesome acting, great soundtrack, and even better story thats unfolded in such a great way. I wish more movies would be like this.Get busy living or get busy dieing.this should be number #1 on IMDb, if you haven't seen it yet your missing a true classic	10
 Hope		10
" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is at the top of my top 10."		10
 Best Movie Ever Made	The only way to summarize The Shawhank Redemption is with one word Incredible. This movie is beautifully told and magically shown on the screen. It will bring a tear to your eye and fill you with hope. Andy Dufresne is convicted murderer. He has to spend two life terms in Shawshank state prison. There he gets brutally gang raped and meets many friends including Red the guy who can get things. If you have never seen this movie then you must be crazy. This may be a prison movie but the only crime is if you don't watch it. I strongly advice you to see this movie especially if you are having hard times this will make you feel and think so much better. You have to see this movie!!! Andy triumphs over adversity in this heartwarming movie of love and friendship.	10
 Powerful and Stunning		10
 Man should have hope	The shawshank prison is the movie telling us not to give up hope in any circumstances. This is about the Andy who escaped from the shawshank prison. He comes to a jail because he killed his wife and her lover. But he insists that he didn't. Andy meets red who have been prisoned for 20 years because of the murder. Andy never talks and gets along with other prisoners at first. He needs time to get accustomed to prison life. Andy becomes the financial adviser for the guard and at last for the noton, captain of the prison. He gets trust from the Noton and has better life in prison. One day, Tommy , a TV thief, comes into a jail. He says that he knows the real criminal who killed the two people. Being shocked, Andy ask Noton to have him rejudged in court. But Noton gets him solitary confinement because he is afraid of losing him as a financial manager. From that time he is gonna get ready for redemption from prison. Eventually he do make it. He makes the tunnel to the outside with a tiny hammer. I think the lesson from this movie is that man should not give up hope for the better life.	
 Should have won the Oscar	Absolute travesty that it lost the Oscar to feel-good trash like Forrest Gump.I like the fact that the Shawshank Redemption didn't bother tying up the loose end of the 'real' murderer remaining free. It was sufficient for Andy that he knew he did not commit the murders. He lived his life for the future, not for the past.There is something very touching about the scene where Andy does some financial work for one of the warders, and all the prisoners get beer as a result. He just sits back and smiles - and his unselfish act has such excellent consequences for him, both with his relations with the other prisoners, the 'sisters' and the guards.	10
 What an excellent film.	Shawshank Redemption.. Where do I start..?By far, the greatest film ever made. My eyes were glued to it the whole way through. Amazing. It was so great to watch.. I loved it. The idea and storyline of the film is just such a good idea. Finally I've seen a decent prison-life film. If you have this stacked away in your cupboard and haven't watched it, make sure you do! It's a fabulous film and I recommend it to anyone who likes watching a mystery, drama or even people who enjoy a cry.Chris Harris Number 1 Shawshank Redemption Fan	10
 Greatest movie ever made	"I'll go out on a limb and say this is the greatest movie ever made. The first time you see this movie and are not aware of its ""secret"" it seems like an average movie, with a good plot and great acting. This is the rare movie that actually gets better the more times you watch it. I've seen it more than 30 times and I just never get tired of it. If you like movies about perservering in the face of adversity and never giving up, then this movie will definitely appeal to you. Be sure and buy the DVD so you can see the extras about the location and all the backstories related to the movie. It's well worth the price. The cinematography, the writing, the acting, the direction -- everything is brilliant. This is one case where the movie is actually far better than the book or short story."	10
 The best movie ever made!	Let me try. As a former Cop injured on the job in 1998 it's sometimes easy to despair. For many of us It's almost as if, we cannot see the blessings in our life unless they are taken from us or we lose them. This movie is about Hope. That's what makes this movie so special. there is a deep lesson in this film and like a work of abstract art, it's what you chose to take from it that makes it whatever it is. For me it's the message that no matter what, it isn't over till it's over. And to quote the film. Get busy living or get busy dying. That's a message. I'm going to try to live it out. Also the entire cast are incredible in their roles.	10

 This is simply the greatest film ever made	"This is simply the greatest film ever made. when you see this movie it will take to a place of where it is not just a movie but the greatest story ever told and some amazing directing by Frank Darabont, the acting is also great and it stays strong for the whole movie. This movie deals with personal encounters and problems the characters will face, on top of that it contains unforgettable dialog and some moments you will never forget, you will be truly moved by this movie and will wish it will never end. because this is my favorite movie of all time it was not hard to get in that place because of how great it was, i thought it was even better than the classic ""The Godfather"". this is a movie i will recommend to everyone who like movies movies because trust me you will love this.Morgan Freeman in my opinion is one of the greatest actors and has only won an Oscar for his work in Clint Eastwoods ""Million Dollar Baby"". I thought he should have won and ward here and for ""Driving Miss Daisy"". He has just recently been in the thrilling ""Batman Begins"" which the best out of the ""Batman"" franchise. Tim Robbins is a varied actor, I'm not saying his movies are either good or bad, what I'm saying is he can play any role like in ""Bull Durham"" he plays a cocky baseball player and in ""Mystic River"" he plays a disturbed family man. But when you see Freeman and Robbins together on screen it is something very special and in this situation it creates the greatest film of all time.Frank Darbont, the man behind ""The Green Mile"" and ""The Majestic"" wrote and directed this wonderful film adapted from the Stephen King Novela ""Rita Hayorth and the Shawsank Redemtion"". This is the best adapted King book, only a few others are that good, Stanley Kubricks thrilling adaptation of ""The Shinig"" and Darbonts ""The Green Mile"". frank Darabont does not drag on anything in this movie because not once did I get bored, you may think that there is not much that goes on in this movie but there is always something that is happening. At the beginning you think that Andy(Robbins) will not be able to last the first night, and you see Red(Freeman) and his friends making bets on who will freak out, to their surprise it is the fatty who freaks and Hadley beats him over the head which ends up killing him. After this Andy knows he is going to have to stand up for himself, he quickly becomes friends with Red but enemies with Heywood. Heywood and his friends would beat on Andy because he is the new guy. I wont say anything else about the movie because I don't want to give any spoilers. 10/10"	10
 best picture ever	The godfather was the best film ever made until I saw The Shawshank Redemption. The story, performance, sound, everything is amazing in this film, even though you ask yourself who is good and who is evil but it show us that revenge is a dish that tastes better when is cold. Tim Robbins is excellent. But Morgan Freeman ratifies as one of the best actors of all times, and of course Stephen King's story is at the same level of his best. Many people talk about this picture that never get one single Oscar and compares with many of those that won that prize. And why not to talk about Frank Darabont who gives us such a picture as the green mile. For me and many people is among the best films in all times.	10
 Hollywood Redemption	"When I first came across the title ""Shawshank Redemption"" I didn't have a clue as to what it was about, since I didn't know the plot. But it had Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman as it's stars, so I figured that it was worth a peek. What a peek!! This movie is awesome!! Not the classic tale of a innocent man being sent to jail for a crime that he didn't commit, this movie was much more detailed. It shows you how cruel prison life can be. (Although, if you want a better picture of prison life today, I suggest watching ""American Me"") You have everything in this picture, Corrupt Prison Warden, Sadistic Guards, and a innocent man caught in the middle. You can not help but admire Tim Robbins character ""Andy Dufresne"" as he waits patiently for almost 20 years before he is able to rectify his situation. Talk about patience and perseverance! This is one movie that will tug at your heart. Excellent movie."	10
 brilliant film		8
 Well made, well-acted, great story, but not one of the greatest of all time	I've been meaning to see this movie for several years now, having heard all the hype and comments rating this as one of the best films of all time. It certainly wasn't disappointing- despite the relatively slow pace compared to most brainless blockbusters of today and tendency towards sentimentality that crept up from time to time. It certainly wasn't one of the greatest of all films, in my opinion, either; simply an intriguing story, with something to teach us, perhaps, very well told and very well acted. It's probably a movie I'd watch again, though not straight away, as it is quite slow paced, and, just towards the end, I felt it was getting a little too drawn out. But it's very good to look at, there are some great performances, a nice musical score from Thomas Newman, and a great plot, with a wonderful twist at the end. So, overall this is a very good movie and one I would recommend.8/10	8
 No equal	"This is simply one of the greatest if not ""the greatest"" movie ever made. It's a beautiful story, presented excellently by Frank Darabont, and brilliant writing in the part of Stephen King.Even though this is a fictional story, it's so well presented, that you feel like you're a silent character in the film. You are made to feel like your're in the cast. You almost expect your name to appear in the credits. The character development was excellent, from the main characters played by Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins, all the way to ""the sisters"", Although we may not have liked them, we feel that we somehow know them and can relate to their specific plights. However it was done very well, because none of them overshadow the main characters, and the main plot of the film. Undoubtedly a Classic. Should be studied as long as film exists."	10
 All together a brilliant film.	Shawshank Redemption was a brilliant film that was original and believable. It was a story that truly touched my heart, about friendship, survival, Hope and trust. The twists in the film were so unexpected, Andy was an Exceptional character that grew on me as the film progressed, the character Red helped to contribute to the originality and clever thought that formed this film. I thought using Morgan Freeman (Red) as a narrator was really a different idea. The director not only thought about the scenery but also used colours and lighting in the film very cleverly The director of this film definitely deserves a pat on the Back!!! All together we give this film 10/10 I definitely recommend It!!! Sedge n Melissa.	10
 The Power of Hope	I have to give this Film Credit, Defiently when credit is due. This Was an outstanding film. The history of this film was that it actually was taken off of short story from Steven king. and as I'm not a great fan of Steven King. I would say this movie is like a Flower that grown out of dirt. The Story is about a man. and the power that hope can achieve. In jail he accomplished things and hardships no man should suffer. he triumph in goals and achieves without deferring. and he never gave up hope. It took us on a roller-coaster and in the end it showed us that miracles can blossom where you would never expect it. It was a beautiful and it deserved a lot more then it ever got.	10
 Hopeful: A Classic with a Fair Share of Flaws		7
 Beautiful, hard and touching		10
 One of the greatest films ever made	I didn't see this movie in the theaters when it came out. I had never been a big Steven King fan, and it just didn't catch my imagination. A friend brought the video over one night for us to watch it, and MAN! I was blown away. The theme of the movie is hope, and what hope, and the lack thereof, does to people. This is truly one of the most uplifting films which I think was ever made.I thought that everything in the film clicked. The acting, the direction, the cinematography, the music, all were perfect. I have read some posts where people don't like the ending, but I think the regressing shot of the two friends is right on; you see the culmination of the struggle to be free for both men, yet it's not in your face sappy.As far as the best scene, I would have to say it's a three way toss-up:1: The aria scene 2: Brook's suicide 3: Red in the wheat fieldI probably pull the DVD out once a month or so to watch this gem. JRW	10
 Truly a modern masterpiece.		10
 They don't get much better than this	This movie is simply outstanding and is one of the best if not the best I've ever seen. Its my joint 3rd favourite with Darabont's other great king adaptation The Green Mile and Seven. This movie is flawless on every level. The key to it though is possibly the greatest ever script ever written by Darabont, and truly outstanding acting from Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. No need to go into the plot. This movie is all about hope and will inspire you to do anything. The brilliant ending is definitely the best i've ever seen and brought a tear to my eye. Watch this movie whenever your happy or sad. It doesn't matter. The film will give you so much hope and happiness. It really is that brilliant. In fact i'm watching it now.WATCH IT NOW 10/10- Probably the greatest movie ever made	10
 Favorite movie of all time	This is by far my favorite movie of all time.How do I know this is it with so many other good movies out there? I thought along before I came to the conclusion. My basis..every time, yes, every time the movie is on T.V. I stop and watch it and love every minute of it over and over.I still get tears in my eyes when the movie ends. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins are wonderful in the movie.I think everyone knows but this is one of those rare movies that was really good that is based on a Stephen King book.This is a must see feel good movie!	10
 Best Film Ever Made	Lord of the Rings:ROTK and Godfather are amazing films but the fact that Shawshank Redemption wasn't noticed as well as them is the reason i think this film is third and not first in the ranking.shawshank Redemption is a film that never won an award yet remains one of the best film ever. It is the most rented video and most sold video to this day and so it should be.To sum up this film its a prison drama with twists and turns and very strong relationships, its got everything you ever want in a film and then some, I urge people to watch this film if they haven't already.10/10	10
 My most watched ever movie	"I loved this movie and have watched it over 50 times in a 2 year period; I believe it should have won an academy award, but its my guess that the ""bull queer"" scenes removed any chance of that. The dialog between Andy and Red was spellbinding at times and the interplay between them and the other guys in their clique made it seem like being in prison could be enjoyable. My wife hated the movie because of the scenes containing violence and I have to admit that some of them could have been left out, the movie really didn't need them to be successful or appear real. I originally thought I would hate this movie and didn't see it till it was on HBO TV. The other movies that come close to being most watched are Titanic and a comedy called Midnight run."	10
 The Best		10
 I like it	The Shawshank Redemption is an attractive film which tells friendship, hopes and dreams, Calm psychology, unyielding fighting will, wise and resourceful design , spirit working with perseverance of leading man in the film are very moving. Shawshank dared to struggle with unfair destiny and crime. Later he exposed the crime. He met how great difficulty did not surrender. I admire his courage and intelligence very much.This film which can move my heart is offer people to hope from start to finish¡¢This film reveals the shady deal of the administration of justice and expresses many philosophic theory of life. Let me know: The powerhouse saves oneself. Generally speaking, this is a good film that is worth sampling repeatedly.I wish that can appreciate more similar successful films in the future.	
 Review of The Shawshank Redemption		
 Review of The Shawshank Redemption		
 The most brilliant movies I have ever seen		
 there is hope, there is success	"After I enjoyed the movie that was the best one I had ever seen,my first feeling was that there is hope, there is success.Indeed,hope has a very great impact on us.When Andy was put in the prison for the rest of his life,he do not give up like other prisoners.Because in his mind there was a hope that one day he could resume his freedom. Just as Andy said""get busy living or get busy dying.""So, Andy pay off in the end.Spending 19 years to dig a hole from which Andy escaped was not an easy thing, even to my surprise,his tool for digging the hole was a very small hammer--incredible!From this ,we can see that how great hope is on a person.During the long period of 19 years, Andy suffer from lots of pain,however,the powerful brief and hope made him stick to the end.I believe a person without his hope is impossible to manage it. This movie made me know that in our real life,one must have hope,especially,when he is in trouble.There is a very famous saying that fits it:No pain,no gain."	
 HOPE IS THE BEST THING!		
 Freedom and brave		
 Music over the prison	I like Andy to put ¡°Marriage of Figaro¡± of MOZART very much. The holy and pure and loud and sonorous soprano wears clouds and split the silks are frozen by people who are confined firmly long. They may not know what music it is, is to the beautiful feeling, to free aspiration, everybody is the same. People look up and look at the dark blue boundless sky, the beautiful sincerity drifts with the wonderful harmonious sounds everywhere, the lens rises slowly, has shaken, all living things resume and look up at on the square, so absorbed, then with deep feeling, there is no wicked to the extreme criminal, it have it is the brutal have unless prison of conduct the alert, have the equal and harmonic in involution people, what people last existence of life very much to and origin. Andy has got drunk in music and Andy has forgotten one's own private danger that puts the music on. He closes the eye to hark on the prison warden's chair happily. Later, what he was imprisoned for fortnight imprisoned alone. It is this feeling; keep the hearts of convict and visitor forever.

" My opinion on ""shaw shank redemption"""		
 An excellent film with suspension		
 confidence and hope		
 a must see movie		
 The perfect movie...		10
 WOW!	When i first heard about the Shawshank redemption i was dubious because i have not really been interested in prison films. Once i had watched it i immediately went and bought the DVD. I must have watched this film dozens of times (which is very unusual for me). The acting, story-line, scenery where all amazing and when the subject of favourite films is discussed my friends and family most people have the Shawshank Redemption as there favourite or at least in their top 3. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robins are perfect as the lead characters and you become so absorbed in there characters. Thoroughly recommended as this is a classic.	10
 Simply Amazing	"Perhaps the best movie ever shot, as evidenced by its rating of #3 on IMDb's top 250 list. This movie is so good, my words will do it little justice, but alas, I will try. The music: perfect. The actors: Morgan Freeman in his best role, in a word perfect. The pacing: its long, but this accurately portrays the idea of time in prison. The theme: wonderful, and inspiring at every viewing. If you have not seen this movie, you must. You will not regret it. The ""Shawshank Redemption"" is the most overlooked movie in history... this movie should have won a number of Oscars, among other awards. It is just that good. Go rent it, buy it, borrow it, whatever, just see it!"	10
 Quite simply the greatest film ever made.	"Frank Darabont's ""The Shawshank Redemption"", starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, is the greatest film ever made in Hollywood. Plain and simple. The film tells the involving story of two prisoners at Shawshank Prison, and their decades together under the thumb of a cruel warden and his henchman. Andy (Tim Robbins, never better) is an innocent man, who uses his accounting skills to make himself useful to the warden, and struggles to keep up hope, against the counsel of his fellow inmates. Red (Morgan Freeman, astonishing) thinks hope is a dangerous thing, and is an institutionalized man, who can't imagine life outside of the prison walls. The film also stars Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown, William Sadler, and, in a powerful performance, James Whitmore. I'll say no more, because this film must be seen to be understood."	10
 A monumental achievement in film history, Argubaly, the greatest movie ever.	"This movie has it all. The screenplay, direction and dialogue are all first class. No movie comes near it. The speeches, Morgan Freeman's acting...my oh my, just brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The movie shows how crucial it is for us human beings to live in a world of hope, and not in fear. As he says in the movie, ""...so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words, some things are best left unsaid""...that line is very true of this masterpiece. I will say no more, but just bow down to possibly the GREATEST movie that there was, there is, and there ever will be!"	
 what an exciting film it is!	It's the most impressing movie I've ever seen.I saw it coincidentally but was shocked very much by Tim and Morgan's acts.Especially at the end of the movie,I am aware of what is hope and how one can keep his mind alive.Is there anything more difficult for a single person to dig a hole through a wall in a jail within 19 years?We always consider it as one out of ten films that men have to see in his life(certainly it's on top).It's very pity that the Academy Reward neglected it,Tim should win all awards in 1994.Although few people have heard it before but if one is asked to see it ,he is surely very fond of it and thinks it is the best .I believe that Redemption will stay as long as I live on my mind.	10
 awesome a real life changer		10
" The Best Movie ever made, ""Ain't No Doubt About It....""!"	"One of those very rare movies, that even though you may have it on DVD or tape, you'll still stop and watch the WHOLE movie to the very end if you find it playing while 'channel surfing'. I, like everyone else I know, found out about this movie from someone else; I did not see this at the movies. So, I rented it and was (like everyone else apparently) blown away by this true cinematic masterpiece. Over the past ten years my wife and I have probably seen the movie a couple of dozen times each. If someone out there needs a 'pick-me-up' movie' (we ALL do sometimes!), then this is YOUR movie. It's always guaranteed to always remind one that ""Hope is a Good Thing...."""	10
 Hope: The essence of life.	"This is by far one of the best movies made. It talks of hope, patience, the will to prove the truth and above all, friendship. Andy's fight with hopelessness and the tragedy that he is forced to face is truly inspiring. Not once do we see him beaten down by the situation. He not only saves himself but also puts back new life into the likes of Red and Tommy. A few scenes like the time when Andy plays the music over the loudspeaker, ""Brooks was here, So was Red"", the climax are all unforgettable. The dialogues and the performances are flawless. Andy is wrongly accused of killing his wife and her lover. He ends up in Shawshank, a place where a normal being would succumb to the helplessness. But Andy fights it out. The ""change"" Andy brings about in the situation in Shawshank is probably impossible. The story is narrated by Red, Andy's best friend inside and later. Truly, an amazing movie!"	10
 Flawless Story-Telling		9
 No matter how you slice it, it's the best movie ever....	I am a movie buff, seen just about all the classics, new and old, but Shawshank is number 1. I think LOR attempts, in a much more complicated manner, to deliver a similar theme - hope even in the most bleak of times. Shawshank delivers this message even more effectively than LOR, and crystalizes the message of hope as the single most important thing in our lives, even more than love. Many of us do not have love in our lives - but hope makes us continue, search for a better life, a better day. I like to put it this way, nothing ever good in this world ever came from quitting, giving up. All that is good in this world, came through persistance, hard work, determination.....hope. No other piece of movie making has ever reflected this message better than The Shawshank Redemption.	10
 'Get busy' seeing this film	Eight or nine times now I have marvelled at this masterpiece. Every character is right on the money, the main performers especially Freeman are simply outstanding. However it is the smaller characters like Brooks and Heywood that add the subtle ingredients that most pictures miss out on. The story of redemption is an old one, the performances and soundtrack to say nothing of the grimy screenplay lift this way above the genre. It is almost impossible to pick a highlight, but perm from the Mozart scene, the bottle of suds, the letter from Brooks and the denouement and you have a cocktail of perfection. It is adult, it is moving and it is hugely satisfying, everyone should see this at least once and the fact that it bombed at the box office first time round says more about the audiences and press reviews than the movie itself. It should have won 7 Oscars, but who cares they are a plastic Hollywood manifestation, for anyone with an ounce of taste this is the finest movie of all time, by a mile.	
 A Masterpiece	I honestly don't know what it is about this movie. I've seen it somewhere around 40 times and I never tire of it. If I'm in the middle of watching something else and I happen to see that Shawshank is on again, I'll completely forget about whatever else was on and stay glued to this one.It was the first DVD I ever purchased and I picked up the anniversary the moment it was released. It's always good to have a backup copy in case I wear out one of them.The actors did an absolutely splendid job in this one. Tim Robbins was absolutely brilliant. Morgan Freeman played the best Irishman I've ever seen on the screen. All of the smaller player were just excellent. And all of this from a 'prison' movie.Hope, friendship, life ... what a story.	10
 A story that holds onto hope in the the face of hopelessness.	I picked this up on video seven years ago. The movie bombed in the UK. The story inspires hope, whether your male or female. The rich characterization is skillfully handled by Robbins and Freeman. Darabont's script sets up quite a gripping visual antagonism that wholly rewards the audience with a feel-good ending. It made me weep, time and again. And when you lose hope the film's portrayal of redemption over adversity can lead to your own redemption. The power of the visual and the word of hope make this a great film. It has already spurned the box office in favour of the people. It is more than just a commercial venture it is a damn good yarn that provides inspiration to those who need it. It is the William Blake of scripture, dividing heaven and hell, and the corruption of good. My video copy wore out earlier this year so I'm happily in possession of the 10th anniversary DVD. Best movie in 75 years. Buy two copies your sure to get one stolen.	10
 my virgin	"don't get me wrong. i am 100 percent GUY. just as this is my first topic and comment in this forum. i just wanna devote my FIRST time to my favourite film. fancy seeing everyone here, and happy to be your FRIEND( have you ever seen ""FRIENDS?). i don't want to talk something about this movie. you see, i am just a newbie here, i don't want to be snob in your eyes. all i have known about film is only it is good or not. i cant say much about it. anyway , give me a hello if you like. oh, it looks i could stop here. morethan 10 lines....OK, over. by the way, how will Andy go out if his cell isnot at one side?"	10
 this is a biblically-based movie!	I have seen this movie several times, and love it. I even own the VHS. It wasn't until today that i realized that it is very similar to a story from the Christian Bible, specifically, the Gospel of Luke, chapter 18, verses 1-8. The story of the Unjust Judge and the persistent widow. The prison warden is the Unjust Judge. Red is the widow, so is Andy in many cases. But, most importantly, Andy is the example of persistence and faith. It was not prayer or faith in God that he exemplified in the movie, of course. But, it was persistence in his innocence, in digging through the sandstone for so many years, in gaining his freedom. Persistence in getting books for the library to the benefit of self and so many others. He had faith, he had persistence. And who says the Bible doesn't relate to real life today?	
 How can you be so obtuse as to not think this is the best movie ever?		10
 Nothing wrong here	"I would by lying if I had to rate this film less than 8/10 but then if I was asked ""what's so great about it?"" I would have to reply ""well, nothing really - it's just a good film"".I very much doubt that anyone who looks critically at movies can really see this as anything more than a really good made-for-TV movie. It's like the Bjorn Borg of movies: you can't fault it but what else is there to it?We need more ""McEnroes"" and ""Agassis"" with flair and style which go beyond what we expect from movies that are simply good.Mungflesh Factor 8/10"	8
 Will this film stand the test of time?	The criteria for a classic film to become timeless is very simple. It must speak to every generation that comes in contact with it. Films like the The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind, both which were released in 1939, have obviously aged well. The Wizard of Oz, like The Shawshank Redemption, was not an immediate success and yet it grew an audience. The Shawshank Redemption is a well told story that seems to connect with people on a basic level. It has also subsequently grown in viewership in its first decade. It will be very interesting to see how it fares 50 years from now. Will this film stand the test of time? Will this film always remain a favorite among audiences?	8
 Whoa, backlash!	Its interesting to read the comments on this movie. I don't think any film has polarized users as much as this one has. Almost 53% gave it a 10! 10 is perfection in cinematography, acting, screenplay etc. This movie is not perfect. Granted it tells a heartwarming story and is entertaining enough, so I charitably gave it an 8 and I think that's fair. Is this movie the second best of all time? NOT! I think 53% of the voters have been blinded by the redemption scene and the twist at the end, sure it was neat but check your warm n' fuzzies folks. Other movies that are overrated at IMDb because of a neat twist at the end are The Usual Suspects and The Sixth Sense. A twist does not make it Perfect.	8
 Flawless	This movie has always fascinated me and I have always counted it as one of my favorite movies if not the favorite. I was pleased therefore to find it #2 at IMDb top rated movies of all time. No matter how hard I think I can't really find much fault with it at all. Characters, main and secondary, are all fantastically well played, the plot unfolds at just the right tempo, the surroundings are as realistic as it gets etc etc. The whole movie, though set i a prison with all the violence and dreary atmosphere it brings, still left me with a positive feeling afterward. It's the kind of movie that doesn't leave you, you remember it over and over again with a smile on your lips. 10/10Cyberik	10
 Watch it, you won't be sorry!	To be honest, this is ABSOLUTELY my favorite film!! Frank Darabont (director) did really great work. The film has absolutely NO violence, but it isn't boring at all!!! The dialogs are perfect and the music is wonderful!!!So, a big compliment to Frank Darabont, who is also the director of Misery, which is also written by Stephen King.And then, last but NOT least, there are the actors Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. They're acting so convincingly, you'll never forget them. So, if you would ask me, I give 10 stars of 10!P.S : I'm sorry if you find some mistakes in my English grammar, but i'm a beginner ;-).	10
 my favorite movie of all time	The Shawshank Redemption fills me with joy and hope every time I watch it, which must be well over a few dozen times now. Tim Robbins' acting is excellent as the emotionally repressed banker in jail but Morgan Freeman, who is consistently superb in all his roles, carries the weight of this movie's intelligently uplifting spirit, its pathos, warmth and humanity. Freeman narrates the story and it's his rich voice that details the life in jail and with his majestic, patient compassion adds color to what otherwise might have felt abjectly bleak. Whenever I feel down I watch this movie for inspiration. This is the sort of movie I think people of all ages can enjoy, many times over, seeing it with new eyes at different times in their lives.	10
 Beautiful, Powerful Masterpiece		10
 It is the #1 film, seriously	"Currently, on the IMDb top 250 Movies of All Time list, the top two movies both hold ratings of 9.0. Of these two, ""The Shawshank Redemption"" has roughly twenty thousand more votes in its favor. Ergo, I do believe that ""The Shawshank Redemption"" should finally ascend to its rightful place on this web-page, and hopefully cinema history, as the Greatest Film of All Time. That having been said, I wish now to give my own thoughts on this film, thoughts which will be hitherto corrupted by myriad spoilers.The acting is astounding. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the perfect combination of hope and despair, so that you can love his character without ever truly knowing what he shall do next. Morgan Freeman brings subtlety and depth to a character who would perhaps otherwise be much simpler. Bob Gunton allows you to genuinely fear Warden Norton, and if James Whitmore's performance does not make you lachrymose, nothing can.The plot is beautiful, describing the redemption of many an inmate. Red, though he does not escape institutionalization, becomes a good man. Tommy Williams does the same. The best of all endings however, is Andy's, as he goes through so much to come out clean in the end, something expressed both allegorically throughout the story and literally at the end.The greatest film I have ever seen."	10
 Excellent!!		10
 A Powerful Film	"I enjoyed this film because it shows the way I believe our Judicial system should be;tough, and stern. The two main characters,Red and Andy, form a friendship bond that carries them through the ordeal of prison life. They stick together and help one another.The great scene I enjoy, is when Red comes up for parole and the last time, they set him free. The officials may have thought He served his time enough, and He was older anyway.Red gave a great speech, how he regretted what he did and was very sorry.When he said he would ""talk some sense"" into that guy who committed that crime,I think that moved the officials to change their minds.Morgan Freeman is wonderful in this film and I love Robbins' performance,here."	9
 beautiful, emotional, disturbing, a masterpiece	There are some movies that come along that truly make a difference in cinema and in peoples lives. In my opinion, this is one of those films.***spoilers*** (minor)The movie is about a man wrongfully accused of a crime. He is sentenced to life in prison. He ends up at Shawshank. A prison with a lot more going on than what shows on the outside.There are quite a few things that make this film a masterpiece. One is the story and its qualities and values. Another is its amazing acting by all cast members in the film. The music was great and the cinematography is creative. I don't believe there's a flaw in this movie.11/10 haha!	10
 The Best Film from a Stephen King Novel		9
 Arguably one of the greatest movies of all time and an absolute classic.	Superb acting and brilliant performances from Tim Robbins (Mystic River) and Morgan Freeman (Million Dollar Baby), who play as inmates, Tim Robbins playing a man framed for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. The two inmates develop a friendship over the twenty odd years spent in the prison.This movie portrays an ugly, though bearable life in prison through the 40s, 50s, and 60s.It's a strong piece on how far one will go to redeem himself, even if those things that must be redeemed are not by any means loathsome. See it if you haven't.	8
 The truth set him free! (Spoilers in solitary confinement)	"Morgan Freeman as Red was truly inspired (even if the original story had a white guy), they even used his son for the photo of the inmate as a young man...Tim Robbins as Andy DuFresne was marvelous understatement, Clancy brown as the on/off guard-friend of Andy was a good touch and a boost for his career apart from Starship Trooper... Now, Clancy is in HBO's ""Carnivale"" series and has his own website! As for the warden and ""sisters,""  they were equally well-cast and the plot of the movie flowed despite what fan-sites may or may not nit-pick about.It is a tribute to perseverance and determination combined with patience and retribution couched in careful long-term planning that any true financial head is accustomed to (remember, Andy was a Bank Manager, that knowledge saved him more than once)...Justice sometimes comes from beyond the law if you can wait long enough! This picture is second after ""Casablanca""!!"	10
 This could be the best one	When a movie makes you feel passionate and caring about murderers and thieves, you know you are watching a good one. The Shawshank Redemption may very likely be the best movie i have ever seen. Not only because of the mentioned fact, but because it has the every basics a good film needs. No movie making mistakes really are found through my eyes. This movie is rough, sad or even happy at moments. It makes you feel like you were there experiencing what the characters do. Superb acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman and Frank Darabont's direction too. The Screenplay is not really by any way too predictable and from the first two minutes you know you are watching something special. I really can't of any movie that beats this one...	
 It's all about the story		10
 No matter what rating it got !		10
 Cinematic Brilliance	A film I can watch over and over again - great storyline, beautifully filmed, top-notch acting - I always feel good about myself after watching it - there's hope for us all, even the most downtrodden nonentities in this miserable world of ours! cinematic brilliance. Tim Robbins plays the lead character's role with such a classy understatement, & Morgan Freeman delivers a powerful and nuanced performance that always lifts my soul as well as the great performance by all the supporting actors. I will be the first person to admit to having a slight eclectic taste in films, but this still ranks as one of my favourite films of all time. This truly is my definition of cinematic brilliance - pity we don't get more films like this anymore.	9
 Only one thing lacking...	"Overall, this is one of the finest films I've ever seen. Frank Darabont's masterful screenplay rendering of Stephen King's marginal novella brought every possible human emotion into play. And, every actor in the film did a superb job of translating this fiction into a believable reality.On a scale from 1 to 100, I'd rate this movie a solid 99. Only one thing was lacking in the film to raise that score to 100 ... but this is just a personal thing.POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOWS:During his time in prison, Andy Dufresne learns the identity of the man who killed his wife - a man named Elmo Blatch. And, he learns enough information about Blatch to render him ""trackable"" by an investigator. If 2 brief scenes had been added to the film, I'd have rated it a perfect film:ADDED SCENE #1 - Shortly before his escape, Andy is seen talking to another inmate who gives him contact info for a person on the outside who does contract murder.ADDED SCENE #2 - Shortly before Red's release from prison, we see him reading a newspaper story on the murder of an ex-con named Elmo Blatch.Between the time of Andy's escape and Red's release, there would have been ample time for Andy to hire a private eye to track down Blatch and, afterward, hire a contract killer to kill him. Had I been Andy, I'd not have felt truly free of the suffering I'd endured in prison unless I knew the real killer got his just due. What Andy did to the Warden and Hadley is all well and good. But Blatch's death would settle all scores once and for all."	9
 It Will Alter You In Some Way	The finest movie ever made, no question. If you can sit through this and not be moved by the sheer power of the story, performances and imagery you are not of this earth. I had already read the Stephen King short story so the ending was no surprise but, guess what, it didn't matter ! That was just the cherry on top of a supreme masterpiece of chocolate cake. This is the current yard stick by which all other movies should be measured against. The basic foundation of the film is so strong that all the other parts must have dropped into place with ,seemingly, effortless ease. Hopefully one day something better will come along that will shift the goal posts once again. But for now, The Shawshank Redemption is a more than worthy No. 1 on IMDb.	10
 somewhat unrealistic	Although the acting and directing was brilliant, the movie retained a somewhat unrealistic vibe. There is a very low chance that one will find as many civilized friends and people in a maximum security prison. There was no sign of any violent or aggressive behavior in many of the inmates. The only thing that reflected real prison life were the cells and the sisters. Do not take this wrong. I loved the movie immensely. It showed great imprisonment and in many ways was realistic. The acting from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman was perfect. The institutionalization of Brooks was very well portrayed. This movie had many great factors but not completely perfect. Overall I give this movie a 8.5.	
 I love this movie	Spoiler My opinion is that this movie is the best movie ever made (next to gangster,mob movies which would over all be my favorite) But the Shawshank Redemtion is a kickin movie that i could watch everyday i love the characters and the whole theme of the movie i love the sets and everything its so real it puts you right there in prison and it shows you that prison is no fairy tale. the lighting is great i just love everything about this movie, at the beginning when andy gets convicted for a crime that he didn't commit and he was sent to jail for it you kind of feel sorry for the guy but at the end when he breaks out and he is living in his dream place you don't feel so bad for the guy after all you kind of feel like it was all worth it for him	
 Definitely deserves a top 10 rating	"I have seen this movie dozens of times and thoroughly enjoy it each time. I've seen people commenting that this is simply a remake of an earlier film, and I don't see how one can come to that conclusion. The original work was in the form of a novelette by Stephen King, part of the book ""Different Seasons."" You may also remember the movie ""Stand By Me"" which was adapted from that same book. Being that I am a fan of King's work, I originally had high hopes for this movie. Often I am disappointed after having read a book and then going to see the film version. Not so in this case. The filming location was here in Mansfield, Ohio, and the Reformatory used for much of the filming is an historical site which offers tours (it is also rumored to be haunted, but you can believe what you wish.)"	
 Truly fantastic	To me this is one of the best films ever to grace the big screen, it has the lot. I have seen the green mile as well but this film stands shoulders above it, It made me laugh, shed a tear and smile from ear to ear, its truly a magnificent piece of cinema magic and i recommend this film to everyone. Stephen King knows how to write suspense and horror and Frank Darabont knows how to direct. The characters are brilliant and there performances a sight to behold, Morgan freeman is brilliant as the man who can get you anything (in my eyes this is his finest performance as an actor) The music as well adds to feel of the film and makes it an absolute pleasure to watch.I think the film will appeal to anyone and will carry on being a classic for many many years to come, i don't think i have seen a film that has meant so much to me, it makes a change to watch a truly awe inspiring, golden film such as The Shawshank Redemption instead of the normal Hollywood action flick.	10
 Brilliant and Moving:		10
 What this film means to me (Spoilers)	"I first saw this movie when Channel 4 showed it in the UK in September 2001. I had just come back from a wonderful holiday in Ohio, USA and had never heard of this movie before. I just happened to flick to channel 4 and caught a glimpse of Morgan Freeman watching Tim Robbins make his entrance into Shawshank. I had missed the opening scene with the court case. My first impressions was that this was going to be a typical prison drama but I reached for the TV guide and read more about it. It starred Morgan Freeman who I remember from Along Came a Spider and Deep Impact and Tim Robbins who I have heard of but never seen on screen before. The TV guide gave it a good rating and review so I thought i might continue to watch it.In the opening scenes, I predicted possible rivalries between Andy and Heywood, however I was glad this was not the case as both characters became well-liked throughout the film. I even thought there would be tension between Andy and Red, but I was delighted that they became best friends throughout the movie. Along the way, I found the movie becoming interesting with many plots running alongside each other and beautiful photography. I held my breath when Hadley almost threw Andy off the roof and Morgan Freeman's story telling was first rate. Another scene that moved me was Andy playing the Mozart record and giving hope to all prisoners in Shawshank. I even went out to buy the fantastic soundtrack with the song as well as the superb score by Thomas Newman. I must say I was concerned when Andy got in trouble for that stunt, as I thought eventually the warden was going to help him solve his case. All the characters gave memorable performances and I was moved by Brooks taking his own life as he couldn't cope on the outside. I was shocked when Tommy revealed Andy's innocence and equally curious when the warden refused to help him. Nothing prepared me for the way Andy escaped, I was so glad he did but felt for Red at the same time. I was thrilled when Red got his parole and just hoped he didn't feel institutionalised like Brookes. I thought Red blew it when he talked up to the parole board but had a chuckle when he finally left Shawshank. Other moving scenes were Red reading Andy's letter and making his way through the fields surrounded with grasshoppers. The scene that took my breath away the most, was the shot of the bus as it made its way along the road with the brilliant sunlight, it looked just like the area where I had just come from in Ohio, as well as Red and Brookes in Main Street, Mansfield which I recognised. This film is long, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me, it is a movie you wish would go on for a bit more longer. I was stunned at the end, very moved, very happy and almost in tears. This film is truly a work of art, probably the finest movie ever made with superb acting from all of the characters, beautiful music, cinematography and so much better than the novel it is based on. I cannot believe it did not win any Oscars despite many nominations. It gives the viewer a sense of hope, happiness and satisfaction all in one and anyone can see this movie whatever mood they are in. The movie is also funny, who can forget Hadley with his, ""if I hear anything more than a mousefart..."" or Tommy explaining when he got arrested and had to drop a TV set. This movie makes you feel great to be alive and as Red says this movie is ""so beautiful it cannot be expressed in words"". I bought the DVD for my family to watch and their stunned silence at end confirmed my suspicions that they loved this movie too.Shawshank Redemption is going to be re-released in the UK in September and I would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it before to go and see it and hopefully feel the same way I felt when I first saw this movie. There is so much to appreciate about this movie and everytime I see it again, I love it even more."	10
 A Great Movie	"A wonderfully made movie. The best thing about movie is it never looses its pace. Neither it gets fast nor it gets slow... Rightly placed at #2 on IMDb.Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman makes a great pair in the movie. Villain, Bob Gluton, the Jailer performs his role very well. ""Hope is good thing, probably one of the best thing, and no good thing ever dies"" is the central theme of the movie according to me. Calm, Placid banker Andrew Dufresene lives his life with hope without loosing his temper. and that's the movie is all about. Frank Darabont did an amazing job adapting from Stephen King's short story, and he deserves as much praise for it as possible. Nobody, not even my favourite writers such as the Coen brothers of Quentin Tarantino (partly for the fact that the first only writes comedies and the latter only fares in blood spatter) could have achieved this amazing script, which completely uplifts and spellbinds the viewer."	10
 One of the best films of the 90's, my 9th favorite film!!	The Shawshank Redemption is without a doubt one of the best film's of the 90's. Morgan Freeman has another outstanding performance just like he had in Glory. The plot was as good as ever along with the dialouge. The music was nice and the atmosphere in the film felt like it was in the 40's, 50's, and 60's. Beautiful full of triumphant acting. This is Frank Darabont's best movie, even better than The Green Mile which I also though was really good. This is one of the most recommended films of the 90's and you definitely will enjoy it. I mean come on guys, it even got in the 250 movies of all-time with a 9.0 and it got #2. Excellent film!!10/10!!	10
 Shawshank Redemption is a gem	Well what can I say about this modern day classic that hasn't been told already. It seems that most of us who have been lucky enough to watch this gem have been profoundly moved by this story. Not hearing anything about the release of this film in '96, I rented this out without any idea what to expect, other than it was a prison drama. Now I love prison flicks and my favourites are Brubaker, Birdman of Alcatrez and Stir Crazy, but after watching Shawshank Redemption I can say this is one of the best films ever made, and one of the very few movies that made me cry, and it takes a lot for me to shed a tear. I think the last time I cried was at my grandpas funeral, but that was a different emotion to the one I felt watching the Shawshank Redemption. The ending was filled with a great deal of satisfaction and hope that you rarely get in any film today. If you want to watch a film that has a story that covers human survival, struggle, bonding and hope and want to be uplifted than this is the one to watch.	10
 a film par-excellence. Full of emotions and thought	When viewers see a young banker's character (Dufresne) convicted of a gruesome murder, and later when they see him vindicate himself with the help of pure courage and hope, it evokes high emotions like triumph and hope. Each scene is skillfully written with viewers' perspective considered all through the film. Excellent work due to which Frank Darabont never need prove himself as a director again, because this one goes down in the history books as one of the best dramas ever written.Dufresne's character does what's on his mind says and never shows feelings of captivity while at Shawshank. The character is carved out meticulously displaying traits like intelligence and a mind determined to surviveMorgan Freeman ('Red') delivers a brilliant performance, deserving the Academy Award that year which ultimately landed up with Tom Hanks ('Forrest Gump').	10
 One good movie	It's weird to see a good rated movie only after ten years and find yourself smiling happily at the end. There are less and less movies able to provide that feeling.The Shawshank Redemption is one great movie that reaches to your heart and mind and makes them both better. I won't go around comment about how it's like or how it's been made. I just wanted to share what it made me feel like.If you haven't seen it, go out, rent it and watch it. It's definitely worth the time and the money. I finally understand why its rating is that high.	10
 Ten out of Ten	After watching it a few time, this film has become my favourite! Each time I watch it I get more and more into the characters and I love it even more. On the contrary of what you might think at first the plot is not about escaping from the prison. If it was only that it wouldn't be anything special as there have been a lot of films on that subject. What the film is about is the development of the characters themselves.I don't want to spoil it at all so I won't say any more about the story. All I can say is that I don't see to this day anything wrong with the film. Everything is brilliant from the acting to the music. I don't see how it is possible for somebody not to like it. I'd recommend it to anybody. It's one of those films which make you realize that you don't need CGI and big explosions to make a great film. But on the contrary big budget films are often the worst...	10
 A 10/10. Let me repeat that if it wasn't clear. 10/10!!!		10
 the greatest film of UN	Andy Duffrane ---- the greatest hero ; Stephen King ---- the greatest scenartist ; Wooden Norton ---- the greatest villain ; Tim Robbins ---- the greatest actor ; Morgan Freeman ---- the greatest minor role ; Brooks ---- the greatest victim ; the hole --- the greatest miracle ; Freedom --- the greatest spirit .make it the greatest film ,But I don't know why didn't it win any Oscar ?	10
 - Perfect -	Shawshank Redemption Is as Perfect as a Film Can Get This film has everything , Tim Robbins (Andy Dufresne) Has played His ace in his acting life With this film He plays his part so close to perfect it hurts , Morgan Freeman (Red) also played a massive part in the film and his acting at times was amazing together with tim robbins they made the film as good as it was, but even Bob Gunton (Warden Samuel Norton) played a superb ruthless warden Together with  Clancy Brown (Capt. Byron Hadley) They made acting seem so easy and it was joy to watch them , also this movie had u thinking whats gonna happen next will he or wont he. It Was just one them movies that was always destined to be massive Hit with many great quotes and smooth as u can get storyline with an amazing twist to the plot that will catch u off gaurd anyone who has not seen this sould watch it soon as possible to see how films sould be made 10/10Fear Can Hold U Prisoner. Hope Can Set U Free.	10
 My thoughts... [10/10]	Quite simply, the finest film that I have ever had the pleasure to see. It's a classic take of good overcoming the bad, and takes viewers on an emotional journey through the lives of inmates, particularly Andy Dufrene and Ellis Redding, at Shawshank jail.I have seen this movie at least ten times, and is one of the few films that I could honestly watch over and over again - always more to look out for, always more ways to enjoy it.The story, direction, casting and acting are all second to none, and together create a nigh perfect cinematic experience.I urge anyone who has not seen this movie to watch it as soon as possible.	10
 Some of my film friends wouldn't agree		9
 Laugh, Cry, Gasp, Cheer, Be Amazed and See One Of The Greatest Movies Ever Made		8
 this is it	this has been said so many times before i may be mad watching this at alow ebb this film works for heart and soul of the individual watching this film is utter perfection and yet immediately after watching this i watched EDUCATING RITA now call me mad but i found these films quite similar in a way that RITA is also a prisoner trapped by her life surroundings wanting to become educated her motto as well is GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING back to shawshank this film is as i said pure perfection if you havent seen it WHY ?	
 Tim Robbins is a wonder	Sucked into this movie by his earnest persona, I watched despite the (apparent) certainty that he would live out his whole life in prison for a crime he says he did not commit : a depressing thought but a totally upbeat movie as his character Andy moves from surviving to molding the lives of others in a positive way. Told from the viewpoint of fellow prisoner recounting his experiences with Robbins' character (Morgan Freeman - another delight to watch) This movie, like its protagonist, is a champ! Watch this movie! I've seen it four times and still channel-stop on it.(PS Be sure to hiss at Bob Gunton as the truly evil and hypocritical warden! A real contrast to Andy's good nature and philanthropy.)	10
 Captivating	"I would only put this movie behind the LOTR trilogy (I consider them one movie). It is a great tale and even though you know something good will happen, you don't know exactly how, though when looking back it was pretty clear. I value movies by how entertaining and captivating they are. This one was both. Many people like to put on their ""film-maker"" hats too much. This movie doesn't really show great symbolism or tricky camera work. Its just a very good story with very good acting. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are unreal, and all the supporting characters (Brooks, the prison guards, etc.) make the film complete. It took my a long time to see this movie, even though its on TNT and TBS like every weekend. I must say I was thrilled. Just excellent. 10/10 easy."	10
 One of the best movies ever (spoiler)	"No wonder this movie is on second place in the top 100 movies here on imdb.com This is one of my absolute favorite movies of all time and i still haven't met anyone who doesn't love it as much as i do. And if i do i will probably look at them funny and ask what is wrong with them. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are both excellent in this ""innocent man wants his freedom"" movie. This film is about friendship, freedom and justice. A man is sent to Shawshank prison for something he didn't commit. Here he meets a man who will become his best friend. They stick up for each other against the corrupt prison system and other inmates. You really have to see it to understand how fantastic this movie is. I rate this movie 10"	10
 A Mesmerizing Masterpiece	Before you start reading my comments on this movie, please keep in mind there are very minor spoilers, so if you haven't seen it.what are you thinking, go and watch the movie, you won't be disappointed.This is the first time I've written a comment about a movie on this website, but I think it will be my first of many as I have so many favourite movies I love to share my opinion about on the message boards.I only just stumbled across 'The Shawshank Redemption' about a year ago, I had noticed it was ranked number 2 and thought I'd give it ago. I've heard people talking about it and how great it is, so I bought the movie and I watched it. I admit that I had to watch it twice before I fell in awe of this movie, but now it's become one of my favourites.This movie is about hope. There is nothing set in stone. Someone may be able to take away everything you have in life, but whatever you think, whatever you feel they can never take away your thoughts, they can never take away your hope and that's what happened with Andy. He may have sunk to the bottom of the hole, but he never gave up hope that he would get out.This is a true masterpiece and it is well written, well acted, well directed, well it's just brilliant. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman produce a great friendship in this movie. It may not have won the Oscars, as it lost to another great movie, but it certainly left an imprint in the movie world and to me.One more thing, watch out for James Whitmore as Brooks, he's sure to break your heart and move you to a place you don't go too often.Remember, if you didn't like it the first time, give it another chance and watch it again, I promise you, you won't be disappointed you will notice little things and the scenes that you have overlooked. It's sure to turn your head and mesmerize you.	10
 one of the greatest	"this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I have watched this movie over two dozen times. I never tire of seeing ""Andy Get Them"". the lack of awards that this movie recieve was a true travesty. Tim Robbins performance ranks as quite possibly his best and considering who we are talking about that is saying alot. Morgan Freeman talent overshadow the fact that he was not like his character in the book. The rest of the cast though for the most part nameless is extraordinary. Chief among them though is Ron Perlman. There cant be anyone who didnt feel a great swell of joy when they heard the chess piece go through the poster. This is one of the greatest cinema moments i have ever witnessed. This film taps into you and elicts a great emotion. This is something few movies have or ever will do, but it is what makes this one of the greatest films ever made."	10
 Masterclass	"I dont know from where to start talkin about this movie.. i saw this movie around 4yrs bak. i have never been so involved in a movie before.. this totally took me by surprise .. everything about this movie be it the performance of the actors.. the story telling is excellent.. the situation of the prison life being shown really touches you.. and the climax was more than an icing on the cake.. its background score is just awesome.. esp the part of ""brooks was here "" i cant get enuff of that piece of music.. all in it easily comes as the best movie i have eva seen.. and one thing i usually do is make other people also watch this masterpiece.. its brilliant.."	10
 A Compelling Film	My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. SpoilersIn many ways, I am more than a little shocked at the overwhelming popularity of The Shawshank Redemption. I am not in anyway saying that it is a bad film, in fact its a great film. However, I never thought Shawshank would appeal to so many people. It just seems odd that it has received over 112,000 votes (More than the Godfather) and it is #2 on the Imdb top 250 list. I do not think it deserves this high position but it is nice to see the film get alot of notice.Shawshank deserves high marks in these categories: Directing, Acting, Cinematography, and Writing. This was the debut feature for Frank Darabont and he chooses to let Shawshank unravel at a slow pace. This is the perfect choice for the film. It moves slow but it is nevertheless compelling. There is only one time when the slow pace actually interferes with the film.Darabont also gets some highly impressive from his cast. Tim Robbins gives a strong, subdued performance. Morgan Freeman, who was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, does an equally strong job here. The chemistry between them is effective too. As strong as the two leads are, they do not outshine the supporting cast. All of them are excellent but two of them deserve to be singled out. James Whitmore gives a brilliantly moving performance. Bob Gunton also deserves mention as the warden in charge of Shawshank. Cinematographer Roger Deakins should be given a lot of credit. He finds the perfect mood for the film. Shawshank is not a colorful place at all. He creates a dreary atmosphere that fits the film perfectly. There alot of uses of the color, gray that is used to create this atmosphere.I have heard a couple of complaints that the film gets a little preachy at times. I cannot find where it does. In my opinion, Shawshank Redemption is a well-written film. There are numerous memorable quotes.Shawshank does have one flaw. I think it begins to drag near the end. This happens after Morgan Freeman is released from prison. These moments are the only times when the slow pace interferes with the film.While I do not think the film deserves its high spot on the 250 list, it is a compelling and moving film. Shawshank does enough things right to overlook its sluggish ending. I recommend the film to everyone.	9
 The People Have Spoken...	If this is not the best movie of all time, it is no doubt an amazing phenomenon and possibly the most beloved movie of our time. I have heard literally hundreds of people talk in glowing terms about this movie and mention it as their favorite, and I'm not even conducting a poll. I was blown away when I saw it ten years ago in the theater and to me it's still the best movie I have ever seen. Best ever? Who cares. The votes on this site speak for themselves. This movie has gotten where it has without hype or pretense; it just is what it is - the most beloved movie of our time.	10
 The best film I have ever watched	It's sad it's uplifting. It's right it's wrong. but most of all it's the greatest film of our time and everyone should have this in their collection. Everything from the heartache that tim robbins character faced to the power of friendship with one mans struggle agains a wall of oppression he made his path to the top and he fool them all. This is with out a doubt the greatest thing I have ever watched and I feel that everyone should know about it and watch it at least 20 times, for there are some valuable lessons to be learnt but dont take my word for it go there and see for yourself. This film set the marker for what prision films aspire to. These guys should be knighted and given the key to the world never mind the city.	10
 Shawshank Redeemed.....a truly majestic movie	This perfect prison drama has everything except women.  Tim Robbins gives a truly majestic performance and should've been nominated for an Oscar alongside co-star Morgan Freeman (he's good, too).  It's a whole lot better than other prison movies you see nowadays.  The film is honest, deep, and shows that you can find hope in the most unlikely of places.  I would give this movie ten thumbs up if I had ten thumbs.  But since I don't, I'll just give it two.  I wish Stephen King could write more honest stories like this one.  Remember, this movie came beforere 'The Green Mile', and everyone knows classics are always better. It's nice to see that Hollywood can produce movies that aren't complete garbage.	10
 Excellent Movie	This is a very fine movie that was unfortunately somewhat overlooked when it was first released. Word of mouth and critical acclaim has resulted in the movie becoming one of the best known and loved films of recent times.The story tells of the imprisonment of Andy Dufresne (Robbins) at the harsh Shawshank prison. Gradually over time he befriends Red (Freeman) who is the fixer in the prison who can get hold of any items at a price. Andy channels his frustration into making things better at the prison. The smallest achievement is celebrated and used as impetus for the next challenge. The film should really make the viewer treasure the things that we all take for granted on a day to day basis. The other interesting aspect of the film is the institutionalisation as portrayed with Brooks. he has been in prison for so long he cannot (and does not want to) survive on the outside. 9/10	8
 Fantastic, brilliant, moving!	In this moving and dramatic portrayl of the imprisonment of an influencial man (Tim Robbins) in Shawshank prison. This man builds up strong relationships and is a benefit to the lives of many in the prison.Tim Robbins plays his character with superb acting, backed up by an equally amazing supporting cast. The story takes the main character, Dufrain, and his friends on a journey through the rigures of prison life.Wonderfully directed and produced, this film topped the box office chart and was quite rightly rated extreemly highly among imdb users when it first came out. This fantastic film has new suprises at every corner. Do not miss it!	10
 Best film of all time.	This movie is the best movie ever made. I'm not a fan of drama, but this movie is just amazing. It incorporates some comedy in there, too. The plot is outstanding. In a nutshell, it is the best movie of all time.	10
 Brilliant		10
" It goes in line of ""The Green Mile"" in which it stirs your soul and moves you."	"I thought it was a very well made prison movie with a nice suprise at the end.  In my opinion, it is going a bit to far to say that this is the best movies of the 90's.  Very good movie indeed, but I view it as just another well done prison movie.  It goes in line of ""The Green Mile"" in which it stirs your soul and moves you."	
 Wicked	This is the most enjoyable movie ever made. With many one liners that can fill ones life with hope.This movie came out the same year that Pulp Fiction and Forrest Junk came out, the only reason this was not a Best Picture winner. Vote 10 if you can.	10
 Truly, the greatest film ever made	Upon seeing The Shawshank Redemption, I realized that a movie can be so good and so powerful that it can keep you in awe for a long time. I saw Shawshank years ago and have probably seen it fifty times since then and not once have I been bored or uninterested. I have been blown away by this movie since the first time that I saw it. There is truly no movie better that The Shawshank Redemption. There is no better story and there is certainly no better theme. Redemption, hope and friendship have been displayed in the finest form leaving you filled with the two former. Truly, the greatest film ever made.	
 Just the tiniest flaw in an otherwise masterpiece		9
 my favourite film ever	I really wish that I had never seen this film as I have wasted so much of my time in front of the tv watching this wonderfull film. I must have seen it about 100 times, and bought the video or DVD 5 times for myself and friends. Well done to Frank Darrabont for making an excellent film from a very small book, I can hardly believe that 2+ hours of my life have gone so quickly. (As they say time flies when your enjoying yourself! )	10
 Yank your heart out and stamp on it	An emotional rollercoster that plods along for almost 3 hours.  It's only a few days later you realise how good a film it was and how it alters your perception of life itself.You almost have to watch a second time just to try and understand what it is that you like so much, unfortunately, I still dont know why it has such an impact on me.  I have now seen it 6 times and it still makes me cry in wonder!	10
 Why number 2?	Why is this movie only first-runner-up? This movie is without a doubt the best movie ever created! All I'm saying is GET BUSY LIVING OR GET BUSY DYING... Thumbs up!	10
 BEST MOVIE EVER	Shawshank Redemtion combines great acting with a fantastic story, good editing, and good direction to make this the best movie ever in my opinion! In fact, one of my favorite things to do is watch this movie with someone who has never seen it.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, multiple times!	10
 one of the best movies ive ever seen	this is truly a masterpiec of acting and storytelling and it is one of my favorites.  It has such an amazing and powerful story of friendship and survival and that ending! a tad sentimental but so what! a movie like this needs to be sentimental.  It cheers me up everytime i see it	10
 Best Prison Movie ever made	What can I say this movie is the top of it's class. The Story is great the acting is great . You really care about these characters. Morgan Freeman's performance  is the glue that holds the movie together and Tim Robbin's breaks out in this movie showing that he is a great actor. If you like prison films this is the best!	10
 MASTERPIECE	Can anything be said? surely one of the greatest films of all time, it has tremendous acting and some very sad moments in the film, throughout, the script is solid. The acting immense. WELL DONE TO ALL INVOLVED! Any comments email me- subject title SHAWSHANK.Cheers.	10
 One of the greatest films ever made.	I put this movie on when I'm down in the dumps, and each time I watch it I get uplifted by the pure beauty of the film. It gives me so much hope and light into the world, and it has to be one of the greatest films ever made. The acting was soft and emotional yet powerful. I adore it.	10
 I think #2 is appropriate	I really do think that this movie has earned a place in the illustrious halls of Imdb at the number two position. This movie gives you more each time you see it.  It is not an exercise of the mind, rather a true introspection of the spirit, that reveals to each of us what we can only hope to become.However, I do think that Fraggle Rock deserves a place at number four.	10
 A movie so beautiful it became My favorite film of all Time!	"What can I say...Flawless, spectacular, wonderful, brilliant, great, classic, wondrous, an achievment beyond words!  This movie, is without a doubt wonderful.  I remember seeing only a few moments of it on TV, when I was twelve.  I rented it, and found myself ASTOUNDED by the magnitude of its emotion.  I didn't cry, but I felt as though someone had pierced my heart with an arrow.  It felt good!!!  I have never seen anything in my life so affecting.  This is my favorite film ever!  Nothing will ever beat this as my number one.  I love Citizen Kane, and I think it is ""the best film ever made"" on a critical standpoint, But I love this just a little bit more. Cinematography, music, writing, directing, acting.  EVERYTHING PERFECT! It is spectacular.  I will never forget ""The Shawshank Redemption""."	10
 Fantastic	This is a fantastic movie! A strong friendship in a tough prison, a strong movie in the feelings, and a critical comment to American prisons. And a surprising ending!Fantastic play from Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, in every way a great movie.Andy Dufresne: Mr. Hadley, do you love your wife?10 out of 10!	10
 Pure cinematic Quality on all counts from the page to the screen	"How the hell Forest ""Dam"" Gump won best picture over this Gem of a movie, is totaly beyond me. It just shows how the critics and hollywood itself can get it sooo wrong sometimes. Thankfully like all great movies that often sleep at the box office.. true quality shines through,  and its great to see that the public recognise and all round great movie, regardless of what some overpayed over inteligent critic would have them believe. For me it's the kind of film you just don't want to end.. it's 2 and half hour long but it never drags, and when it ends, you know you've seen ""A GREAT MOVIE"" and you feel full like you've just dined at the Ritz"	10
 Fantastic	"A truly great film. Probably the best prison movie ever made. Even thought it's the only prison movie I've ever seen. Anyway, I think this movie deserves the rating it has on IMDB. Now to get Saving Private Ryan's rating up there. Okay I'll stay on topic. Morgan Freeman is at his very best in this movie playing the ""man who can get stuff for you"" or Red. Tim Robbins was also great as Andy Dufrense. Not only was the acting great, but so was the story. The message here was one that I will never forget. But I won't tell you what it is, you'll just have to watch the movie. 10/10. As I always say to all my favorite movies, great job."	10
 must watch for anyone	it is, if not, the greatest movie i have ever seen. it is inspiring, a tribute to the great acting skills of morgan freeman and tim robbins. there are maybe two or three movies i would give a 10 to, and this is one of them. if you have never seen it before, you should watch it. movies like these are rare.	10
 One of the greatest	This movie really moved me when I first saw it on TV. A great plotline, actors with perfect acting skills and the impressive reflection of social problems and humanity. The most amazing point is that I can barely find an actress throughout the play. Except for Andy's wife, no women have ever appeared on focus. Despite this, Shawshank Redemption has become one of the world top movies, while nowadays too many directors just want beautiful actresses to attracting the audience.	10
 Hope can drive you insane..	What can I say, If you are feeling rather downbeat, watch this movie. It literally lifts the spirit, an emotional roller coaster.What surprises me is, it did not win any Oscar. Well there it proves awards are not the end-word on a movie. Five cheers to Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins acting.	10
 Best prison drama ever.	When i went to see this movie, i expected boring crap, and came out from the theaters with glaced eyes and thougt, best film in history. (Im 19) the movie has it all, GREAT acting, great directing, great(and so on) The one thing that could pull this movie down is the ending,*Spoiler*>>>they shoud never have joined up again at the very end, to audience friendly.9/10[Sorry for any bad english]	10
 One of the best...	"One of Hollywood's greatest movies!  If you're even the slightest fan of the awesome Morgan Freeman, then you'll love him at his best as ""Red"" .  The fact that he didn't win a best supporting Oscar is one of the Academy's biggest shams!!  Great work by Robbins as well as all of the supporting cast."	10
 Never Give Up	"(very minor spoilers) I had to add this to my previous comment after reading a more recent review here on IMDb. The review stated that Christian fundamentalists hated the movie because it showed the true hypocrisy of the Warden, along with his oft quoted Bible and the stitched verse on his wall ""Judgment cometh..."" behind which he kept his ill gotten gains. But I am a Christian conservative who loved this movie for that very reason. It shows that God looks at the heart. The Warden had a wicked heart, regardless of what came out of his mouth and what he hung on his wall - and clearly his judgment did come! Andy was kind at heart, offering friendship and help to any who would accept it, and well, he got what he deserved in the end. When Red gave up trying to pretend something before the parole board, trying to tell them what they wanted to hear and instead just spoke the truth, he gets his parole. Both Andy and Red refuse to give in to the despair of prison life - instead doing what they can to bring a bit of beauty to the prison. Andy never loses his humanity, and helps Red find his again. They keep hoping till the very end, but don't just sit around waiting for justice, but actively seek it. The ending makes the movie.My husband will not watch it - having a strong aversion to ""prison flicks"" but I have seen it several times, and reading some of these comments has made me want to see it again.It is one of my all time favorite movies - I never get tired of watching it since I went out and bought the DVD. The first 30-45 minutes are full of heavy language and prison violence, but that only makes the contrast between those who have given up their humanity and those who have held onto it. Not appropriate for young children, but for those able and willing to look at the reality of life - it is beautiful!"	10
 Spectacular! - Morgan Freeman Plays a Stellar Role...	For years this was one of my favorite movies that I found myself watching over and over again. Then, I went out I bought the DVD when it was released and haven't watched it since. They chose just the right actors to play each of their roles. Tim Robbins best movie by far and another one to add to Freeman's resume, not that he needs one. Bob Gunton, who might not be as well known as he should be, playing a great warden with his usual personality that fits in perfect with this flick. If there is anyone who has NOT seen this film, I recommend at least giving it a chance by renting it. You are really missing out on something special.	10
 Problably the best King movie ever made	I saw this movie a few years ago and thought it was amazing. A couple of weeks ago I saw the book Different Seasons where the story first appears and read it and found to my great suprise that the film is way better then the story. I´m a big Stephen King fan and have read many books by him and seen many films based on his work but I have got to say that this is the best film I have seen based on his work.	10
 Fantastic film, definately the best Stephen King adaptation to date.	Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give possibly the best performances of their careers in this adaptation of a Stephen King story.  The build is slow but the payoffs are plentiful in this prison drama about friendship and redemption.  This is also one of those great movies that get better with each viewing.	8
 Great	You must see this film. It´s a homage about friendship, freedom. Wonderful cast, great script. Memorable moments. An excellent chemistry between Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. You will be astonishing, at the end of the movie. To see it, enjoying every minute of the story. Enchanted, gorgeous, emotional.	10
 Genius		8
 Impossible Not to Watch	This is one of those rare, rare movies that almost forces you to stop what you're doing and watch it through to its conclusion each time you come across it on WTBS or one of the other movie stations, even though you've seen it many times and you own it on both VHS and DVD.  Put succinctly, it's remarkable.  There have been many comments of praise on the movie as a whole and on the uplifting and thrilling ending (beginning with Andy's escape and continuing through to his reunion with Red) and so anything I might add would be superfluous, but just I've got to single out the scene on the rooftop where Andy ingratiates himself with the brutish and sadistic chief guard by showing him how he can avoid paying taxes on his inheritance. It's the turning point of prison life for Andy and ultimately Red, and the scene is flawlessly written and executed.	
 The Ultimate Story of Friendship	"The Shawshank Redemption (1994/Frank Darabont) **** out of ****""I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up DOES rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my friend.""- Red (Morgan Freeman)This is the ultimate story of friendship. It tells the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a young hot-shot banker who is railroaded for a double murder in 1947. He is then sent to Shawshank Prison, where he soon befriends Red (Morgan Freeman), a man 'who can get things'. The movie spans almost 20 years, and shows the growing friendship of these two men. Joining them is the old pro James Whitmore as Brooks, who does a great job as a man who ""lives in fear"". This is the best ""feel good"" movie of all time, and one of the best of the 90's. It is flawless in a departments. It is based on a short story by Stephen King, and is masterfully put onto the big screen. Freeman turns in his best performance, and has many great lines as the stories narrator. In fact, the film is well written and projects deep meanings of triumph and hope. Many critics have complained that the film is too long. Whomever truly believes this can not call themselves a film critic. The film is slowly paced to show the long growing friendship of Andy and Red. It's pacing is what makes it so real and excellent.SPOILERS: The ending is the best part of the film, and has probably the best scene in motion picture history: Andy's Escape. The film's music plays a big part in this scene, showing Andy's determination and endurance. You end up rooting for him all the way. Another great scene is when Andy talks to Red after he gets out of the ""hole"". Red reveals his weaknesses and fears, but Andy has hope.This film is a masterpiece of story telling, and should not be missed. Like I said in the beginning of the review, not only is the film flawless in all departments, it excels in every way. You will believe in hope.-30-"	10
 Forgivness	Forgivness is releasing a prisoner, and realizing that prisoner is you. This movie might be the best movie that I have ever seen. You will laugh, you will cry, you will want to hug somebody. It is so hard to believe that this tale came from the horror novelist of our time. Do yourself a favor and buy this film. It's a keeper.	10
 Stephen King's best adaptation		9
 Could Be the Most Important Film of the Decade.	I have nothing but praise for THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION.  It is touching, high-spirited and full of motivation.  Tim Robbins plays a banker who is wrongly convicted of the murders of his wife and her lover.  He is sentenced to life in prison and eventually befriends another lifer (played by Morgan Freeman in a powerful role) who has just been denied parole.  It may sound like a simple story, but Frank Darabont's direction, along with endearing performances and a cheerful climax, makes the film so energetic and magical. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION is a breath-taking masterpiece.5 out of 5	10
 Absolutely the Best Movie Ever!	I have just finished watching this movie, and I have no words in how to describe this movie.  It is absolutely the best movie I have ever seen.  I have given this movie a 10 because the story is almost life changing, and differs the views of people about the world.  Everybody should get a chance to watch this movie, it is life changing! Ten out of ten should definitely be the number 1 movie of all time, because it is such a good story, with such moving acting.	10
 Makes you feel all into it!!	In one word: Magnificent! This movie is a masterpiece! It soaks you up and it leaves you behind feeling hopeful for ways which at first didn't seem to be there.. a really fantastic movie you definitely should see! Morgan Freeman, once again, showing how much of a big actor he is! *thumbsup to the cast & crew*	9
 Cinema at its very best		10
 Still resonates after nine years.	"Okay, couldn't Morgan Freeman have at least TIED with Tom Hanks for that Best Actor Oscar?  This film works on so many levels.  Freedom,  innocence, aging, prejudice, masculinity.  My only ""but"" is this:  Having seen the television show 'OZ,' it seems that in prison the lines of good and bad, friend or foe, are very blurred.  In this movie, they seem a little too cut-and-dry.  Other than that, I can't think of a single other critique, nor can I come up with any other words to do it justice.  If I had to pick from either this film or ""The Godfather"" only, it'd be this, hands down!"	10
 Shawshank Not an Original idea but...		9
 Beautiful storytelling at its very best.		10
 Best Movie Made So Far	When it comes to what really matters. This movies got it all. The cast of the two main characters is perfect. The whole cast makes a hell of a job. The music the story. This is my all time favorite movie.	10
 Best of the best!	No movie can beat this movie. The actors in this movie are so good, that when you start this movie, you can't stop! I've seen many, many movies, but this one is just the best. Tim Robins is in this movie just great. I think that if you've seen this movie, you would agree with me.	10
 Simply the best movie	"The famous British movie reviewer Barry Norman said ""Your favourite film must be one that you can watch whatever mood you are in."" This is simply the case with this movie. Whenever I am down, up, crying, laughing or whatever I can watch this film and feel even better. Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne to perfection. A film with so many twists where you think ""That's it, he's gonna kill himself"" but it carries on and you see all the characters develop, even Morgan Freeman who plays the emotion-less 'Red' (brilliantly, I might add) at the beginning who doesn't give a hoot about anybody other than getting the other inmates what they want turns out to be a person who accepts that there may be hope. A film which is great throughout and has a fabulous ending."	10
 Destined to be All Time No.1 - The question is only - When ?	A Simple $ Appealing Story with a Beginning, Middle & End.And yet, so Rewarding to so many !Why ? Because it simply connects with more viewers than any other film !What more can anyone ask for ?Please see it & give it the vote it deserves ! (ie. 10).	10
 Great Film	There isn't much I feel needs adding to the praise already given to this film. But I know exactly what another reviewer meant when they said they wished they hadn't seen this movie, so they could enjoy it for the first time all over again. It really is such a complete film, with an ending which has likely caused many to privately shed a tear and then deny it afterwards down the pub..... :-)	
 Best Movie Ever...	Simply put, ShawShank is the best movie ever...bar NONE.  A very good story, excellent directing and production and a stellar cast.  Was robbed by the Academy when they gave best picture to Forrest Gump.  A great movie for the family (13 and over) and surely a movie you will watch again and again.	10
 WOW	This movie can be summed up into just that word, WOW.  I mean out of all the movies i have seen in my life this one i have loved from the first time i watched it to the last time watched it.  Everytime this movie is just as exciting and interesting as the time before.  It has a great cast and story and truly captures the fight of oppression and the challenges of the Human Spirit.  Very inspirational and a timeless classic.	10
 An Amazing Movie in All Areas		10
 Magnificent	"This movie is brilliant. Fantastic screenplay, very nice music, and best of all; Morgan Freeman. One of the worlds best actors ever.This movie should really be in every DVD collection all over the world. It's really that good. I'm a big fan of ""prison"" and ""war"" movies though, but anyways, this movie is absolutely brilliant, and I think most people would find it very good.10\10"	10
 The best movie in the category!!!!	This movie is the only one that make me hang over the edge of my sit!!! The history, the actors, the scenes were just  perfect!!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT	10
 An ultra-extraordinary movie...	Every single frame of The Shawshank Redemption is designed with extreme care. I think it is the best movie of all times. Such a movie can be produced once in every century. This movie should be watched once in every month. Although I watched it many times, when I re-watch it, i still get the pleasure that i got at the first time. It makes me grab the life more strongly. If you are a desperate about any subject, watch this movie. For sure, it will change your view of the life...	10
 Hope can set you free	If you have never seen this film, you must be a criminal in spirit.I don't claim to be a free man, but I am sure of that I am greatly inspired and excited when Andy escapes from Shawshank, and I feel like a criminal who eventually sees the sunlight from the blue sky and smells the fragrance of freedom on a grassland. Yes, at that moment I am free.	10
 The most moving drama I have ever seen.	This is by far my favourite movie, though sometimes it's hard to explain exactly why.  It could be the amazing work which each and every actor did, or the wonderful script and direction from Mr. Darabont, but whatever it was, it changed me.  Honestly, I am not kidding.  I never watched movies the same after seeing this film, everything had to now be compared to Shawshank. Not since Star Wars has there been a film which has had such a huge impact on how I watch and comprehend fiction, including film, TV, and books.	10
 Its the best!!!!	Its really a great movie to watch. I don't know how many times i have watched it but still i would like to watch again. In my view its better that God Father which is on the top of imdb.com ratings. You watch it and you can know your self. Its all about great Friendship, Hope and Dedication...fantastic movie....	
 One of the best movies out there	I didnt need IMDB or anything else to tell me if Shawshank is a good or bad movie.  This is one of those movies you will never forget and i have watched it five or six times and everytime the film gets to me, and thats why i consider this a masterpeice.  You cant get better acting then this..	10
 Good movie, but not a masterpiece		8
 i address this to the university eleitests who quote wells etc		
 Morgans beaming smile	The Shawshank Redemption improves with every watch, so much so that u almost imagine your place or your role in the prison and try to understand how that lifestyle would affect you. Frank Darabont may all the praise for adapting this novella into such a masterpiece fall on your much deserved shoulders because your style of filmmaking is unique in these times of unsubtle blockbusters. The background to this story is probably too well loved for me to go into but Tim Robbins delivers a painful, regretful, intelligent performance that u cant see coming from any other star. Morgan Freemans brings so much comfort and bitterness to his turn as red that as u reach the end of the film when his smile starts to show and they embrace u know u have just sat through something special. An enriching experience.     10/10	
 Every bit as good as its reputation		10
 The best because of the simplicity	"This movie does one thing, but it does this in excellent way. All actors in the movie are awesome. The movie easily stands by itself as the best movie of all time. Many will disagree with this because they have an internal defend against new age movies abd they preffer to consider favorites the old ones of 60's and 70's. This movie is simply the best out there because it has absolutely no disadvantage.Stephen King's Movies will either be the ""worst of all time"" or the ""best of all time"" as happens with his books. This is the case of this movie. Best of all time whatever they say."	10
 the ultimate prison movie		
 This movie is absolutely great!!!	"This movie is absolutely great!!! It would be impossible for me to tell how many times I've seen this film... To anybody who hasn't seen this incredibly movie, i can only say: ""what in the world are you waiting for, step away from your screen and go buy/rent this film immediately""... Anyway, it definitely deserves to be #2 on the list..."	9
 Hail Freeman, Robbins and Darabont.	The story will always touch my heart. The courage, the endurance, the friendship, the goal make the best chemestry. Hail Mr. Freeman as Red! Hail Mr. Robbins as Andy! Mr Darabont makes the best adaptation ever from Mr. Stephen King's novels.	10
 the best movie ever!	This movie was actually filmed partly in my hometown.  Plus, my dad's in it. So, I'm a little partial to it.  But, I have NEVER talked to someone who hasn't absolutely loved this movie.  It's definitely a must see!	10
 A Genuine Classic		10
 Exceptional Filmmaking	This is wonderful filmmaking filled with gut-wrenching emotion and drama. I do not agree that this is the 2nd greatest movie of all time.  Perhaps it belongs in the top 50.  This film as well as Director Frank Darabont's follow-up The Green Mile are based on Stephen King short stories and I honestly cannot say that one is better than the other.  Masterful direction, acting, and storytelling.  I am very, very particular about the films that I give a perfect score.  I go for more thought-provoking plots rather than well-told melodramas like Titanic.  This is certainly an excellent film with its triumph of the human spirit theme and I believe that it is worthy of a 9.  Excellent film experience.  ****1/2 / *****	9
 The Shawshank Miracle	The Shawshank Redemption is one of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a true Stephen King film. Darabont's effort in the screenplay was astonishing. I love this film. The whole story has twists and turns and surprises in every corner. The best prison movie, most definitely. Robbins delivered a powerful performance. He should have won an Oscar for this film. I loved it and I hoped, I'm sure, that everyone else loved it. I give this film a solid, gold TEN. Highly recommended for those who have taste in movies. If you have any comments for me, please e-mail me at tylerripen@yahoo.com.	10
 Cool Robbins	"(spoilers)What I experienced in watching SR was close to a miracle. No, nothing religious about it. What I mean is, nearly ten years after its release, I was able to watch it without having heard anything about it before, including the ""big twist"". All I know is that it ranks #2 in the IMDB poll, and I share the puzzlement expressed in one of the comments (not that the film does not deserve ranking high....but THAT high?).Watching it on TV and interrupted by numerous commercials hopefully did not take too much away. But what can I possibly say that has not been said in the one thousand one hundred twenty-five comments posted to-date on SR? Well, in my complete ignorance, I was led by the name of King to believe that this was a horror. When this misconception was soon dispelled, I continued to try to make up my mind as to whether the film falls into any specific genre and perhaps sub-genre (as High Noon created a sub-genre in Westerns). I was also not quite sure whether I was supposed to be made to think deeply or to be entertained. Then came the big escape, and I was enormously entertained.If I were to mention just one thing about SR that impressed me most, it would be the character of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins: an endurer, but not a martyr; a hero, but not squeaky clean; a loyal friend, but not a passionate man. Whatever he is or is not, one image emerges clearly: he is cool!A fantastic film, and hats raised to Tim Robbins."	
 the greatest	Their are two great things in this world muhammed ali and the shawshank redemption.It is without doubt the best film ever made.A bold statement you say well watch it and then tell me it isnt.Why is it the greatest well thats hard to put a finger on.For one thing the acting superb robbins and freeman give standout performances.The sweeping score and look add to that.Stir in a brillant uplifting story evil villians and a great twist and shawsank can bellow out i am the greatest.	10
 The strength of this film is in its simplicity (possible spoilers)	"Most viewers do not want to go to overly ""artsy"" movies because usually they try too hard to be intellectually stimulating but fail miserably because it is a difficult feat to pull off.  Movies like American Beauty and Amélie are few and far between.  And then there's The Shawshank Redemption: simple, honest, without pretense.  It appeals to the viewers heart and soul and not his/her head.  No one cares if the prison conditions are 100 percent believable.  It's fiction for a reason!  I never even noticed the clichés until I read a detailed post describing them, and frankly, I'm content to ignore them.  The spinner bait that hooked me on this movie was the relationship between Andy and Red.  Watching this movie for the first time (and dozens of times since) I found these two characters to be two of the most likeable characters I could think of.    The climax of this movie is in my top five of all time (TSR, Memento, Usual Suspects, Se7en, The Manchurian Candidate).  In general, people like happy endings.  I am a big fan of tragedies like The Deer Hunter and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, but I cannot watch them continually with the same emotion.  Watching Shawshank for the Xth time, I experience the same emotional roller coaster as the first time viewed it. People dislike the fact that so many people give this movie a 10/10 rating.  I feel quite comfortable giving this movie that rating because it is my favorite movie.  It is not a perfect movie, but the rating system doesn't go by technical merit.  People should rate films based on their opinion as a whole and not solely upon how well the director uses cinematic techniques.  Personally, I couldn't care less"	10
 Get Busy Living, Or Get Busy Dying		
 A Gem		10
 The Greatest Movie Ever Made. Will Ever See. For me.		
 best movie ever!	The Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made.  I first saw this movie last summer and really didn't know what to expect, given all the stupid early 90s movies that are out there. But once about 10 minutes in a realized that this was going to be a great movie, and it was. It, in my opinion, portrayed what it really would be like to live in jail and, for me, how unfair the justice system can be given andy was obviously innocent. They way he escaped was pretty cool too. So, if you have not seen this movie as of now go out and rent it. It is definitly worth it. ***** outta *****	10
 Can there be enough compliments to describe this film?	"Complete void of spoilers herein, only read on if you like ridiculous praise of a movie on a mammoth scale.I just watched The Shawshank Redemption for the second time, and for the second time it took my breath away. There is just no real word to describe the extraordinary piece of cinema that has been created here.It tells the story of wrongly accused murderer, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), and his story of survival inside a maximum security prison, aided by his friendship with 'the only guilty man inside Shawshank', Ellis 'Red' Reddings (Morgan Freeman). Along the way it branches into at least six different side stories that, halfway through the movie, while still entertained, one wonders what they have to do with the plot. The answer is everything, as becomes apparent by the end.I won't bore you with details of the individual craftsmanship that went into this movie, but I will advise anyone who has not seen it to see it, and as soon as possible. Keep watching until the end, and there is no possible way you can be disappointed. It is absolutely masterly directed by Frank Darabont, and while I thought that his other Stephen King-based film, The Green Mile, was fairly slow and self-indulgent, this isn't. It is drawn out and long, but absolutely impeccable and amazingly inspirational. It delivers the message that even in the face of abject adversity, hope will always prevail. This message was recently hammed up quite terribly in ""The Two Towers"", but in The Shawshank Redemption, just one very simple quote sums it up: ""Hope is a good thing. Possibly the best thing. And no good thing ever dies""This is one for the ages. I cannot imagine that the uplifting effect of this movie will ever die. There is no possible way it could be better. The only possible reason I can think of for not liking or being inspired by this movie is that you just don't want to. There are no two ways about it. Even after nine years, this holds strong as an absolute masterpiece of film-making, and a staggering achievement. Five stars out of five."	10
 WHOA! Whatta film!	"I don't know why it took me so long to see this film but I finally did. I've seen a lotta films in my day, but I think this is definitely one of the top 10. Indeed, it's rated by the viewers as the #2 film of all-time on this database, just behind The Godfather. This film is a powerful story of hope and despair, love and hate, institutionalization and corruption. There's not much violence in it, although there is strong (homo)sexual content. This story takes place almost entirely in a maximum-security prison. The story would be powerful even with no ""brand-name"" actors in it, but Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins both do a magnificent job in this film. This is a film that should not be missed!"	10
 are you kidding?	"The IMDb rating of this pedestrian story which relies on the audience manipulation formula ""prisoners good /prisons bad"" has proven to me that we are neck deep into the decline of all things cultural. When they sell more prints of the Elvis,Bogart, and Marilyn Monroe version of Edward Hopper's ""Nighthawks"" we know we have a problem. When the people who have the Elvis version see the real ""Nighthawks"" and get confused, we have additional problems. When Stephen King's name is bandied about as someone's favorite ""author"" we have Code Red. When Tim Robbins is regarded as some sort of screen presence that can catapult a movie to a # 2 spot we have meltdown.There hasn't been a movie with this much depth since ""The Longest Yard."" I read a comment earlier by a poster who said that this movie will drop off the list when the IMDb reviewers grew up.Sadly, their bodies already have, and their minds which will never catch up. Pass the Velveeta..."	
 Good, but not THAT good	"Contains minor spoilers""The Shawshank Redemption"" has a lot going for it. The cast and acting are absolutely top-class, the main characters (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) are very likeable and the ""bad guys"" (warden + guards) are really evil.In terms of story, I found this movie to be good, but not that special. It has some truly touching and emotional scenes, some good jokes and the twist at the end is surprising and satisfying. Also, you've GOT to admire the persistence and positive attitude of Tim Robbins' character: NOTHING gets him down, no matter what things happen to him, he always keeps believing in himself and fighting back in his own way. But overall, there also were some pretty dull scenes and prison movies cliches in this movie..things like the rapists or the old man with the bird, and the whole new guy/old wise mentor thing have been before. Also, the pace is a bit slow at times.All in all, this movie certainly was entertaining and refreshing, and it left me with a good feeling, but honestly, I didn't find it THAT special. At least not special enough to warrant a #2 position in the top 100. Oh well, it's all a matter of taste I suppose.***1/2 out of **** stars"	8
 you know that feeling?	"This is one of the best movies ever made.Do you know that feeling, you walk out of the cinema and think your still in the movie? dream of it at night, think of it over and over again, discuss it with your friends? and if someone asks you; "" do you know a good movie? "" and recommend that one as the first?well, this is one of them.So, if you haven't seen this one, go out and see it!!!"	10
 Best movie ever!	This movie is brilliant, if you haven´t seen it, don´t read or try and find out things on this movie, just rent it and find out for yourself... It´s the most uplifting movie about human spirit overcoming adversities i have ever seen	10
 The best film ever made	This is quite simply,the best film ever made. Taken from a short story by Stephen King,it turns out to be a true cinematic masterpiece. It takes you through just about every single emotion possible,happiness,sadness,elation,fear and jubilation at the end. The more you see this movie,the more you appreciate just how amazing it is. Each time you watch it you pick out something extra that you hadn't noticed before,and that only adds to your appreciation of it. Tim Robbins' character is one you sympathize with right from the word go,you're rooting for him all the way through the movie,when he has his run-ins with Boggs and his cronies,to when you see him on the beach and he sees Red walking towards him. I know nothing about lighting,editing,or abstract plot development. But I know an awesome movie when I see one,and this is most definitely one of those. See it,be amazed,then see it again and be even more awestruck by its magnificence	10
 Don't have to explain why you like. You just do....		10
 Best of the Best	This film in my opinion is one of the best ever made. When I went to the video store one time in 1999, I was in the mood for a drama. It was a toss-up between Shawshank and some other movie. I chose Shawshank. The plot outline on the back of the movie box was very intriguing. It is most definetly the best movie I have ever picked out at a video store. I liked the movie so much that I went and bought it the next day. Few movies have as much talent and drive as this one. Two of the best actors in my opinion, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. What an excellent acting duo. It's a shame that this movie lost Best Picture to 'Forest Gump'. Gump was good, but this one was much better. I gave it a 10. What a great movie!	10
 The Film Industry Redemption		10
 One of the best films I ever saw.		10
 Amazing		10
 a really good movie	Having read Stephen King's short story when it was first published I never would have predicted it would be made into a movie.  The movie adaptation is also alot more interesting than the original story, mainly because the characters are better developed and the story is livlier.  This is one of the few movies that surpasses the book.  The weakest point of this movie is the rather one-sided view of the penal system, even in the dated version of this story.	8
 Beautiful and captivating	Few movies can grab the soul like this one. For me, every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption, I remember the music. I remember the framing, how each scene is perfectly constructed and put together, displaying the lives of the criminals. Every oily moment with the warden, every frightening vision with the `Sisters,' and of course, every point of pontification by the venerable Andy Dufresne. While I do not consider this the greatest movie ever, it is awfully close o the top. The performances by the likes of Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Clancy Brown (who was doing Dr. Pepper commercials at the time) and Bob Gunton as Warden Norton were all exceptional. One thing that always keeps me coming back is the score by Thomas Newman. While he has based his entire style off this memorable score (listen to The Road to Perdition and Shawshank back to back, and you'll see), the subtle movements and piano keys turn this into one of the best films of all time.	10
 An interesting adaptation of a surreal story	"I find it very interesting that this movie has ranked so high in this database.  One professional reviewer elsewhere had referred to it as an ""overrated cult film,"" and I can see why.  It is one of those movies that is so unique that it just grabs hold of some people while doing very poorly with the general public at the box office.   But to be ranked as one of the best movies of all time?  I honestly don't see why.Personally, I thought the Stephen King story it was based on was much better.  True to his style, it was a very surrealistic tale about something that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  SPOILER AHEAD!  Come on, it is sheer fantasy to think that someone can dig himself out of prison with a rock pick over the course of many years without someone catching on to what he is doing.  I think that's why the movie is so popular:  it's a feel-good fantasy that pretends to be a prison drama.But it is very entertaining, and keeps you wondering if Andy really did kill his wife.  The ending is too predictable, though.Overall it is a very well-acted and directed movie.  However, the objectionable language and the homosexual rape scenes were totally unnecessary to the plot.  It would have been MUCH better if those aspects of Stephen King's fertile imagination had been left out of the movie.  If not for those parts, I would heartily recommend anyone to see it."	7
 Foul Language!	"""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a good movie, but there are definitely a number of disconcerting aspects to it, such as foul language and violence. It takes a lot in a film to actually offend me. I'm a reviewer, so I have to tell what I thought about the movie. Very foul language does tend to bother me a bit, because it gives all the characters of this movie a self bad image, in addition to that, the Bible says `Do not let your mouth coarse foul language because it involves sinful speech'. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" could have been better, but we hear very bad words and an overdrawn narrative throughout the whole movie. Spoilers: This movie is mostly about a man who is in jail and has to face evil people including the mayor who wants to make his life miserable, but he's very smart and gets ahead in life by trying to break a wall with a hammer to escape from jail! Probably this movie moved many people simply because the main character (Tim Robbins) was intelligent and brave, however the whole movie doesn't tell much, only the main character's life in jail and his effort to get rid of it by hope and boldness, which I didn't find very annoying! The ending was somewhat farfetched and predictable, in addition to that we never knew if the man who killed the main character's wife was punished, however I thought that this movie leaves an interesting message at the end which is to have hope when everything seems impossible. 7/10"	
 Doesn't stand the test of time	I saw this movie when it first came out 7-8 years ago and loved it. I was 15 at the time. Saw it again recently on TV and I didn't like it nearly as much. There's really not much to criticize, it's an excellent work, very well acted, nicely executed but it's just....idunno.....too plain and safe. Nothing really daring or new about it, and on second viewing many scenes seem needlessly melodramatic.Still well worth seeing, but nowhere near the classic status that some reviewers here were quick to bestow upon it.	
 MEGET VELLYKKET!	This movie takes you like a storm, starting of easy, but as the movie moves along you get pulled back in your seat just enjoying the fine acting, and story..Morgan Freeman, and Tim Robbins does some of the best acting i've ever seen...THIS IS A MUST SEE!!	10
 Interesting casting choice	"Just a comment about something that I didn't see anyone else mention recently. (I didn't read all nine billion comments on this movie) I thought that the character ""Red"" was a white man in King's story. Now, there's nothing wrong with casting Morgan Freeman in that part, and he was great in it. (He was cast as President of the United States in ""Deep Impact"" and carried that off very well. I thought it was kind of neat to cast a black actor as President and make absolutely no reference to his race throughout the movie. Would that we could be that way in reality.) But TSR was set in a particular time, (1947-1968) and I find it hard to believe that there was utterly no racism in a Maine prison in those days. Sort of undercuts the realism that seemed to be done so well in every other aspect of the movie. Just a minor quibble. Everything else I have to say about TSR has already been said. Grade: A+"	9
 Good, but not the best ever.	Very good performances from Freeman and Robbins. Good writing.  The best move ever?  Nope.  I gave it a 8 out of 10.As a libertarian, my own feelings about freedom, power, and corruption are apparently quite a bit stronger than either Darabont or Stephen King.	8
 One of the greatest movies of all time!		10
" ""Prison is no fairy tale world."""		10
 an exceptional story	Beginning in the late 1940s comes this gripping, poignant, one of a kind prison saga from director Frank Darabont. Freeman is brilliant as a slick but cynical inmate who's spent most of his life within the cruel prison system of Shawshank; Robbins is riveting as a hotshot banker-turned-new inmate with whom he forms an unbreakable bond, and comes to admire for his will, determination, and endless grasp of hope that allows him to transcend his turbulent surroundings. Their deep, emotional bond is the focus of this long, arduous, and compelling journey that showcases friendship and the power of the human spirit unlike any other film of its time. A remarkable, in-depth, and unforgettable story that is sure to be remembered for years to come. ***½	
 As Pandora knew with hope we can survive anything	"I went in to give blood- the staff was watching this.. needless to say several orange juices and cookies later I was still at the blood bank, laughing and crying with the staff.  This is a remarkable movie for its subtlety- I like the fact that no one ever knew Andy was digging a tunnel- I like how he tells his friend to look a certain place if he ever gets out- and I like the message of hope for those who feel hopeless. Stephen King outdid himself with the story and Robbins and Freeman do wa wonderful job with the script they were given. Just to see the words "" brooks was here"" and then ""so was Red"" add those little touches that makes a movie great. A movie that deserved more accolades."	9
 Good, but not the best.		
 Touching, But a Theft Is a Theft		6
 Definitely good but deserves no pedestal		7
 How do you get any better than this?	"Imagine yourself in 1940's Maine, accused of a despicable crime of revenge on your wife and the man you recently found out was her lover, sent to a corrupted prison with a two-faced warden, where inmates are murdered for knowing information that would help an innocent man off the hook, or for crying on their first night of imprisonment. Where popularity with the guards gets you special privileges and crossing the warden while just trying to get the freedom you deserve gets you thrown into 'the hole' for a month. The only light of hope is the special friendship with a fellow inmate by the name of 'Red' and a rock-hammer hidden inside a Bible. ""Salvation lies within."" You can take my word for it, one thing that does lie within this movie is an incredible story of hope that will bring you to the point of tears at some points and enrage you at others. The acting is brilliant, the screenplay is superb. This drama places a new sense of hope in you that you would never have felt before. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is absolutely the movie of choice for anyone who appreciates excellency in film-making."	10
 Who doesn't like this movie???	This movie just rocks, I really don't get it that some people think that movie is just for entertainment.This movie is a lot more than entertainment, it has a deeper meaning that you got to see. It contains a lot of stuff to think about. - Innocent but decides to live with it - The dead of Brooks Hatlen - The decision of Red to follow Dufresne to MexicoThis movie has got 2 of the finest actors (Tim Robbins & Morgan Freeman) in their line-up who play their bests parts untill now (that is what i believe).This movie is just a must see	10
 The Best ever....	It was given by a friend as a marriage gift, I loved this movie right away. everything is soo perfect, the music, the narration, the end. When I feel down here is the dvd.... and I am perfectly in a good mood. I really thank my friend for giving me this movie.	10
 A Wonderful film	The Shawshank Redemption is a beautiful film. The last fifteen minutes are so wonderful it made me cry - and the only other film that has made me cry is the climax of The Truman Show. This is a film that makes you see life in a completely different way - a hopeful way. Don't watch some shallow nonsense like Mission Impossible II, watch a film that you'll remember your entire life. Watch The Shawshank Redemption. It's got 9 out of 10 for a reason, you know.	10
 Feeling depressed? Watch this movie. Only one flaw.	I won't go into all the good things about the movie, since pretty much all of the other posts do, I'll just say I agree.  There was only one thing wrong with it.  Are we supposed to believe that in a prison in 1948, a black guy was best buds with a bunch of white guys?  Oh well, this was made when it wasn't politically correct to have a movie with an all white cast.  If you can get past that one flaw, this movie is a 10.  If you can't, the movie is still an 8 or 9.If you're depressed, this is an excellent movie to watch.  It focuses on when life has really beaten you down.  No matter what happens to him, he tries to get the best of the situation.	9
 The Best Movie Ever Made	I'm sure we all agree, the Shawshank Redemption is the best movie ever made- The Best Picture of all time. A must see movie that is simply amazing. The story and acting will dazzle you. A movie at the end that will make you rewind it and watch again. An absolutely incredible film!!!	10
 No finer story-telling in the movies!		9
" ""Get bust living - or get busy dying"""		10
 Best movie I've ever seen	"Friendship.  In a word, this movie is all about friendship.  Great casting makes the characters believable.  Extraordinary acting makes them come to life.  The bond developed between Andy (Tim Robbins) & Red (Morgan Freeman) is so real that you feel it.  If you're not a sensitive male going in, you will be one coming out.  Go BUY this movie.  It'll make you laugh, cry, and -- most of all -- hope.  The supporting cast is almost as good as Andy & Red.  The warden is diabolically evil.  And his #1 minion (Clancy Brown) turns in a first-rate performance.  Much attention was paid to the sets. Not much left to say except . . . what a movie!!!  There is no comparable film work out there.  I ""hope"" someday there will be.  'Til then, The Shawshank Redemption is the best-in-show."	10
 This is the best film ever!!!!!!!!!!	How can anybody dislike this film. It's definitely the best drama film I've ever seen. If you haven't already seen this film, don't rent it, BUY IT!!!!!. I don't know of anybody who dislikes this film. Its very similar to the 'The Green Mile' but only better, I do like the Green Mile though but this is far better. This film should be number 1 instead of the 'The Godfather'.	10
 The greatest plot twist ever?	I'm not going to rattle on for hours about how good this film is, as I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. The plot twist in this film is second to none, just a pity it was ruined for me.... This film is a masterpiece and my third favourite film of all time, second only to The Godfather and Schindlers List. The Shawshank Redemption, 9/10. The second best film of the 1990's.	9
" Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies"""	This movie is the greatest piece of work ever put on video cassette.  If you haven't seen it get to the nearest video store and rent it.  It can change the way you feel about life totally with just a few quotes and actions by the characters inside Shawshank Prison.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman put on a great show and make this movie the best movie I've ever seen.	10
 Surely movies don't come any better than this.	The Shawshank Redemption is different from any other movie in one most obvious way...there is nothing wrong with it.  Tim Robbins is fantastic as the reserved and to some extent mysterious Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman's portrayal of 'Red' is just as good.  Stephen King shows he is more than a horror guru by teaming up with Frank Darabont to produce one of the greatest movies of all time.  There's humour, there's sadness, there's action, there's drama.  This film has it all.  10/10.  Shawshank is a fabulous tale and it is a shame that it won none of the Academy Awards it was nominated for.  If you haven't experienced The Shawshank Redemption, stop what you doing, leave your house/office and go and either rent or buy this video.  An absolute classic.  The best. Darabont's work has been limited since this film but his last directing sensation was The Green Mile.  Starring Tom Hanks, this too is a fabulous film and both feature in my Top 5 of all time.  Watch them both.	10
 Simple Masterpiece	"The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that slid through the Theatres without drawing much deserved attention. It made no real impact at the academy award either. So why is this movie currently holding the second spot at the imdb top 250, only beaten by the untouchable ""Il Padrino""? First of all, I believe the movie is spot on when it comes to the description of human endurance, persistence, and adaptation. The development of the characters also indicates that imprisonment and freedom can't always be divided by walls alone. Sometimes the highest walls and the worst conditions aren't enough to stop the human spirit, other times the absence of boundaries and even the prospect of something better, can break you down if you lack some of your primal needs. This is where I believe the greatness of this movie really shows. It perfectly pinpoints the vast scope of the human mind, and how we react both similar and differently to challenges in life, and the movie does so in a simple, straightforward way! As ""Red"" says upon the climax of this marvellous movie: ""Every man has his breaking point"""	10
 Better than Forrest Gump	I am surprised at how many people have not seen this movie. It's spectacular. I have two favorite movies. This is one of them. I have friends who have no interest in seeing Shawshank, but after I make them watch it, they all love it. No exceptions. I can't believe Forrest Gump won best picture in '94. The Oscars lick.	10
 It changed my life	The Shawshank Redemption was in the better sense of the word perfect. It reflected on the true life in the solitary confinement of prison. This movie was so powerful that it changed my direction of life. I went from wanting to be a fireman to a movie director and now I am living my dream because of this amazing film. Frank Darabont and Stephen King worked at their best to write this amazing story, added with the amazing acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, this is a must see for any movie fanatic. I give this movie a perfect score!	10
 The best movie I have ever seen	Words cannot describe this movie. I feel this is the best escape/prison movie ever made. The analogy to the human situation is uncanny and it is this fact that makes this movie great and not just very good. Now I know what it means to be institutionalized. ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN !!!	10
 favorite movie	I think this movie is my favorite of all time.  The reasons are (1)I watch it every time it is played on television in rerun even though I have it on tape (2)It gets an emotional reaction from me every time I watch it and (3)I never notice how long the movie is because I am so entertained by it.	10
 This really is a redemption...	amongst so many films that are really well known and stink and blockbusters that stink. This is not a blockbuster but a classic to all movie buffs and it is becoming more and more known and appreciated. I love this film. I have seen it the for the third time recently and still it brings tears into my eyes at some points. The cast is great, with Morgan Freeman and a great Tim Robbins. I still do not know what to think of Andy (Robbins), did he do it or didn't he. There are several hints in the film but I still do not know, for Andy is a hard man to see through.WATCH THIS MUST SEE8 out of 10	8
 Unnecessarily long, but still excellent.	"Some movies really need more than 2 hours to develop their story. I think ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would have been more successful if it was not so long.  The story is truly excellent...moving, intense, and joyous at the same time.  I think it could have been improved by editing out a few scenes which were redundant to the purpose of the mood they were establishing."	7
 Quite possibly the best movie ever made	"With all due respect to the people that complain of it's too stark good vs. evil characters, simplicity and so on... you are missing the point. Having been raised on a steady diet of Hollywood crap, this was first, and only, movie that has been truly inspirational and moved me to tears.  This is NOT standard Hollywood material. It has been pointed out that, in general, optimism is equated with ignorance.  I was of that opinion as well, but this was truly a LIFE-CHANGING movie for me.  This wasn't a movie so much as it was a wake-up call.  I've seen all the classics.  But nothing I've encountered has conveyed such a message of positivity and hope as this movie, without being contrived or obvious. To all those who pour negative reviews on ""Shawshank"", stop being a critic, and start being human.  To everyone else, I think we're all better people for having seen it."	10
 Every once in a long while a truly inspiring film comes along that is a must see for virtually everyone. The Shawshank Redemption is one of these films.		9
 The second place (Top 250) is unfair for this movie!	"At the beginning i thought, this would be an another annoying movie, but now i've a totally different opinion. I saw it yesterday, it was amazing, absolutely amazing! I've got to add this one to my favourite list of movies, which is very short ;): (Finding Forrester, Shawshank, Adrenalin: Fear the rush) The Shawshank should be on the 1st place in the ""Top 250"", that's the right place for it! 1 of 10, i gave it 10! It's fair enough!"	10
 A Story about triumph over adversity	In years to come the Shawshank Redemtion will be seen as a classic and rightly so. The is a wonderfully moving story about a bonding friendship between two men who are locked up in Shawshank prison for differing reasons. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deserve any praise that can be heaped apon them because i feel it is them more so than the story that hooks you from the first time you meet the characters.You feel for them and you hope that thing turn out for the best . If i had to critisise the film for anything it would be the lack of an ageing process that the men go through but that is nit picking. A film you could watch over and over again. 9 out of 10	9
 Great Film. Why no Oscar?	This is one of the best films of all time, and I'm not kidding you. Yes, you're welcome to your Godfathers' and Citizen Kanes' but this is a film everybody can experience, preferably through the medium of cinema, for what it is, a truly great story, backed up by top notch performances by Robbins and Freeman.Everyone I have ever spoken to has enjoyed this film and they were as surprised as me to find out that although nominated, the film did not receive one single Oscar. Why is it so, that a good film like Forrest Gump can win so many but a truly great film like Shawshank wins nothing?Words cannot describe how great this film is, one to see again and again, and not just for the triumphant twist at its conclusion! Watch it!!	10

 Great story with a surprising finish	This movie I can see again and again and again...	10
 Best movie of the 90s!	The Shawshank Redemption is a masterpiece. It is certainly the finest work of Tim Robbins' career, and Morgan Freeman even surpasses his usual lofty standard of excellence. This is one of those few movies that one can watch many times over and never get tired of it. It is hard to believe that the story is based on a novel by Stephen King. Every aspect of this film is first rate. It's the closest to a perfect film I've seen in the decade of the nineties.	10
 This Movie Can Never Be Seen Too Many Times (Some Spoilers, But Not Many)	I first rented this movie because I had heard it was good and because it was there. Through the first half hour, I thought it was entertaining at most, but after the scene where the one man is beaten and nobody cares, I was totally engulfed in this film. There is nothing wrong with this movie. Every action, every word spoken is absolutely perfect. After seeing it half a million times, I can quote it word for word. I still smile with utter joy in the end and get choked up during the scene with Brooks. Frank Darabont is one of the greatest directors I have ever seen, and it is a shame that he has only made a few movies. The music in this movie is also perfect. If you haven't seen this movie, which I am surprised to hear that many people have not, you should rent it immediately. Nevermind, don't just rent it.... buy it. You will not regret it. Ten out of ten! >	9
 Good Movie		
 good but number one of all time??		
 The Best Movie Ever	You must see this movie.  Great plot, awesome acting.  I can't believe it didn't win an Oscar.  It should have beaten Gump that year.	10
 Without question the greatest movie of all time.	Well, Shawshank Redemption is a perfect movie.  There is no scene out of place, no piece of music that stands out, the moral is very clear, and it doesn't even need to be spelt out for you. The acting by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman complete the movie and make it the heart-warmer, the tear jerker, the nail biter, and the perfect movie that it is. After I saw it for the first time, I was instantly touched and a fan for life.  I've only seen it three or four more times, but each time I see it, I learn something new, or discover a new angle of the story. I'd say that if you only see one movie for the rest of your life, it would have to be Shawshank Redemption.  And if, after watching it, you can tell me that it isn't the best movie in the world, then I'd say that there is something seriously wrong with you.	10
 Perhaps the best movie of all time	It's always difficult to choose a favourite movie out of all the movies I have seen, but I really believe that this is the one. When I first watched it, I had not read the Stephen King novella, and had no idea what was going to happen, which made it much more enjoyable to watch. Of course, like any movie, this was not flawless, but was such a terrific emotional experience for someone who is seldom moved by cinema. This was such a cinematic triumph, and I couldn't believe that it didn't win any of its seven nominations at the Oscars. The performances were wonderful, captivating the mood of the film to sheer perfection. Nothing against Forrest Gump, but it should have been easily outclassed for Best Picture. It was also a good movie, but just nowhere near as memorable as this one.	
 Very good, but hardly the best movie ever made.		
 Number One?	How the hell did this get voted number one in the top 250? Meandering adaptation of a tight little King short. Typically hammy performances and so sugary you could drop it into the world's water system and everyone would go hyper.It's okay, as adaptations go, but there is soooo much better out there.Steev	9
 Not #1 material	This film was good, don't get me wrong, but in a million years it would never have occurred to me that this film would rank # 1 in the Internet Movie Database's top 250 films [ I hope this doesn't last - it's april 1999]. It is ridiculous.  It is a good story, has good acting/character development, medium cinematography/music/everything else etc.....As enjoyable as any other half decent film - but not number one in MY top 250 - probably not even in my top 250.	
 The best darn picture ever made	"This truly has to be the greatest film ever made.  This film has you hooked from beginning to end and never loses its edge.  And to think that it came from ""Stephen King"" although this is not the first time King has given us such a great flick (""Stand By Me"", ""Misery"", ""The Shining"").  Whats more unbelievable is that it was snubbed of the Best Picture for both the Oscars and Golden Globe.  Sure ""Forrest Gump"" was a great film but it's not often that you find a movie so captivating and can have such a beautiful, edgy and realistic storyline.  Even the AFI's ""100 movies 100 years"" didn't include this in their list.  Both critics and audiences have had positive things to say about this movie.  I think that if you haven't watched it yet, then you truly can't understand what true movie-making is all about."	10
 The Best Prison Movie I Have Seen Yet!		
 Greatest film of all time?	"No, this is NOT the greatest film of all time.  I don't think you could pinpoint one single film as that but ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of the most powerful and moving experiences of the 1990's (other masterpieces include ""Schindler's List"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""The Piano"", ""Glengarry Glen Ross"", etc.) ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is the harrowing story of a man wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.  He is sent to prison to serve two life sentences.  There he meets Red, who becomes his best friend.  The film speaks loudly about hope and its unending importance in life and that is a lesson we too often forget.  This film is a marvelous reminder, with remarkable performances by Tim Robbins and Oscar-nominated Morgan Freeman.  It is beautifully written and expertly directed and a fine film in several aspects.Regardless of whether it IS the greatest film of all time, the greatest film of the decade, or the greatest film of 1994, it is not to be missed for it holds wisdom and is great fun."	8

 Fine film, but not best of all time		9
 A Friend in need is a Friend indeed.	"I remember the first time I saw this movie. It was on the big screen. Let me say something about how movie-goers in my country watch their movies at the cinemas. They always leave before the credits at the end of the movie is up. But it was different with Shawshank Redemption (S.R.) Most of the audience just sat on although there were not many because it was a working day. All who stayed on for the ending credits were obviously moved by the movie. I stayed on to learn who wrote the story. As I left the first thing on my mind was ""I've got to get hold of the novel from which this movie is made. Some years later the VCD version is in the market. I have watched it in the comfort of my home several times and find that I still enjoy it at every viewing.  I am puzzled how a movie this good could let Forrest Gump sweep all the price. It makes me doubt the credibility of the Academy of Performing Arts. This is a story about Friends. When one has a true friend, no matter how bad the situation is it makes life tolerable."	10
