 One of my favorite movies of all time!	"Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy! Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.10/10"	10
 A Film For All Ages	This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout.	10
 The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen	The Lion King is a great film.  Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children).  Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen.  It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.  And hopefully, you won't either.  A++	10
 This is what kid's movies should be like...	I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar.	
 The best Disney animated film ever...	"The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10."	10
 The Lion King	A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting.	10
 So Good in So Many Ways.	Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so). As he grows up, he goes on a journey of love, friendship and discovery which will lead him back to his rightful place in the world. Excellent. 5 stars out of 5.	
 TLK is Great		10
 simply a wonderful, heartfelt tale for all ages	Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages. A rousing adventure that you can enjoy again and again, and arguably one of the finest animated films ever made. ****	
 A living masterpiece	"This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly."	10
 By far, the greatest Disney movie ever made...	This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10	10
 Masterpiece, the new one doesnt compare	Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!	10

 A Timeless Film	"Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.A timeless film!"	10
 Even after 11 Years, it's still the King.	"I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can't Wait to be King"" will always have a special place in my heart.I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.The King among Disney Cartoons for me."	10
 They don't make movies like that anymore	That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue.	10
 brilliant Disney animated film	this Disney film was probably the most ambitious undertaking by the studio up to that time.the amount of animated sequences are astounding and the detail equally so.so from a technical stand point it's brilliant.and the content of the movie is great as well.the story is wonderful.and unlike many earlier Disney animated movies movies,the villain in this movie is much less evil,and the movie is suitable for most ages.there are a few intense scenes though,and a scene dealing with ***possible minor spoiler***the loss(death)of a character.other than that,though,it should OK for anyone.there are also a fair amount of catchy songs that kids will like,and even the adults might like.for me,The Lion King is a 10/10	10
 A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making		10
 A movie to be watched by every Animator	I being an Animator watched this movie over and over. The quality of animation, movement and voices behind the characters all were so good I have this movie in my collection.This movie was the best animated movie for me in 1994, but still is. The creativity in screenplay, dialog, character development, environment, music, etc. all are masterpieces. This movie is outstanding and exceptional for me.	10
 Brilliant, no other words needed.....	The Lion King is not just my favourite animated movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy.	10
 The pinnacle of animated movies.	The Lion King is absolutely Disney's greatest achievement to date and will long be hailed as such. The story is classic, but better yet are both the stunning animation and the inspirational score by Hans Zimmer. The songs are brilliantly written with music by Elton John (with help from Zimmer) and Lyrics by Andrew Lloyd Webber's long-time partner, Tim Rice. If you aren't among the millions that have purchased the video DO IT (if you can find it anywhere)!	10
 Brilliant film-but possibly even more traumatic than Bambi	"And here's my spoiler, up front: not only is the young lion's father killed in front of him, he's made to feel it's his own fault. Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful ""Circle Of Life"" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". But that being said, I believe that, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113_________________________"	10
 Best animated movie of all time!	Best animated of all time! That's it, that's the review!	10
 My favorite cartoon from Disney!	The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)The story takes place in Africa, where Simba, son of Mufasa, is very well protected by his dad.(sometimes with the help of Zazu, a bird that is kind of a counselor of the king Mufasa)Everything goes well, but there is one problem: Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because he is not the king of the jungle, and decides to do a plan to kill Simba and Mufasa. Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened. Far from his kingdom, Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon, who takes care of him and teaches about Hakuna's Matata philosophy. Everything will be very well for a long time, until Simba meet again his childhood friend Nala ,who tells him about the horrible things Scar is doing in the old Kingdom.	10
 An animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film.	This is in my top 3 animation films of all time. I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film.	10
 The True Classic Disney Movie!		10
 This Will Restore Hope in Your Heart		10
 Disney's future mistake	At first my rating was a 3 star but now it's a 10 after watching the live action one I just can't comprehend how good the original was.First there was emotion and good singing and FACIAL EXPRESSIONS unlike the new one and the voice acting is the best.Like when Mufasa was on the Cliff they were actually talking not just dialog over lions fighting	10
 The Best Disney Movie Ever Made	10/10, despite all their recent success, Disney has yet to do better.	10
 As close to animated perfection as you can get		10
 Best Disney Movie Ever	The lion king is by far the best Disney movie ever made The animation was amazing, the characters were amazing, the story was great it was just a excellent movie. The only thing that I found a bit extreme was killing of Mufasa though to be fair I never found it that sad and I'd be lying if I said balled my eyes out as a kid, but overall, It was such a great movie that one scene like that really doesn't screw up the rest of the movie and that was probably the only thing in the entire movie that it would have been OK not to show. I Still lave the lion king to this day and I'm almost 21 years old and from the looks of I will love this movie until the day I die.	10
 love it	I love this movie its very touching even though they are all animals the music scenes were my favorite as well the movie itself had a whole lot of suspense when the father died and his death was blamed on his own son who had nothing at all to do with the tragedy but his sly evil uncle was the one to blame he planned it all but it was very interesting when he thought that Simba was Mufasa and then the fight at the end was thrilling and the way he died was good for him.over all awesome movie!!! Hope they make more movies that will keep people or viewers wanting more. I believe that this is a great family movie to watch together.	10
 Excellent Movie	I love Disney always have and probably always will. But The Lion King in many ways stands out from the rest. And it's not just cause the prince is a lion. You feel the pain and hurt and betrayal along with Simba. You learn and grow along with Simba. You love along with Simba. As with most Disney animals their facial expressions say more than words could say and when Timon laughs about the Kings of the past being in the stars, Simba really needs to say nothing at all. It's all there written in his face and they way he carries himself as he leaves. It's almost a coming of age story. As a young cub he had the world at his paws. Then he sees it slip away with the death of his father and being driven out by the hyenas. Only to later on come back and see that Pride Rock is really home and fight for what is rightfully his. Pop some popcorn and sit back, relax and enjoy!	10
 Undeniably a Masterpiece		
 Of all the Disney movies growing up, this one has always been my favorite	Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction.	10
 This movie has had the biggest impact on my life of any movie	I don't remember seeing this movie for the first time. It came out when I was one year old. But I do know that for as long as I can remember this movie has been my favorite movie ever. I have a collection of lion stuffed animals and my favorite animal is to this day the lion. This movie has even impacted how I want to spend my life when I get out of school. Before I found out about the Broadway production of this play, I didn't know anything about theatre, but because The Lion King was made into a Broadway adaptation, I have developed a love for the theatre. While I still haven't fulfilled my dream of seeing the stage adaptation of this movie, I do have a passion for other parts of theatre, both being on stage and off and plan to major in performing arts in college. I fully believe that if it were not for my love of this movie that I would not have this passion today. The movie itself though is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie every. It has a wonderful plot that draws from classic inspirations and has some of the deepest and most motivated characters in the Disney franchise.	10
 A great movie	It was a great story that I loved as a little kid and still love and watch the movie.It was a lovely animated movie that was a laugh to watch and really gets to my heart.The music was great the chose the best artists for the movie and really brought the story out.Elton john was a great beginning artist to open the movie.This movie deserves a perfect ten out of ten and deserves to to go down as one of the best animated movies of all times and Disney show open this up as one great family film that should stay out for all future generations to watch and enjoy forever.I wish to see this movie even when i am older and watch it with my children and use it to remember my childhood and remember it for as long as i live.	10
 Awesome		10
 One of the best of the best	I hadn't thought much of The Lion King back then because I'd watch anything. But now that I'm older, I can see why many people agree that it's one of the best movies, and I agree. There may be spoilers ahead, so you have been warned.The animation's great, I really like the songs (especially Circle Of Life and Be Prepared), and I also like the characters (like Mufasa, Rafiki, and Timon and Pumbaa). Out of Disney's protagonists, I feel that Simba's story is one that'll always be told for many years to come. From a cub who can't wait to be king to an exiled prince whose father had been killed by his uncle and finally to be a king, retaking the Pridelands from his cruel uncle Scar. This movie has some hidden good values as well, such as heroism, faith, hope, and reconciliation.That's why I think that The Lion King is not only one of the best Disney movies, but it's also one of the best animated movies ever. So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect ten, and I'd definitely recommend this...and even though The Lion King (1994) will always be better than The Lion King (2019), I hope the remake will be good.	10
 The Greatest Disney Film Ever Made		10
 A milestone in cartoon story-telling.	I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once.	10
 I was a little disappointed	OK I know I am probably alone here, but I was a little disappointed with this film. Maybe the hype surrounding it gave me greater expectations, who knows? I thought it was a good plot, (although an overused plot in movies)and some of the characters were really good. But I found parts of the movie boring and the music not up to Disney standards. Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar. In fact I thought that Jeremy Irons performance was outstanding.The animation was pretty hit and miss I thought.So sorry TLK fans but I wasn't thrilled by this movie.	4

 one of the best children's movies from my child hood	"This movie was such a sweet heartwarming tale. It had its funny moments its action it really is a perfect movie for the kids. And for the adults the acting was great and it had a very good story very predictable but not when I was a kid.This movie is about a young lion cub ""Simba"" who is tricked into thinking he was responsible for his fathers death so ridden with guilt he leaves the pride and goes off on his own. He grows up on his own but meets lifelong friends on the way.This was such an adorable tale. Everyone is sure to love this movie exspecially the kids but the adults will find it very sweet and heartwarming as well."	7
 outstanding movie	This movie is so great and fantastic for everyone, specially for kids. Nice animation and story of this movie. I can see it more than 2 times. really love this movie.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. A++	10
 One of my favourite movies	After watching the live action movie and watching this I remembered how much better this movie was and just wanted to say it.	10
 Better than the remake	Better than the 2019 remake. Animation for live action isn't a good switch on this movie. Animals in the original can express and show emotions, which kept me emotionally involved in the movie. The 2019 movie is absolutely stunning graphically, but couldn't get into it like the original because the animals can't express feeling in their voice or face.	10
 One of Disney's best	The Lion King is one of Disney's all time best films with a great combination of humour and emotion. The animation is incredible and it's extremely well paced. The performances from all of it's excellent cast are great. Hans Zimmer's score is amazing. All of the songs are all fantastic and it's consistently very funny. Its also extremely emotional and comes to a very satisfying and thrilling conclusion.	10
 Beautiful	"After watching the copycat CGI version of this masterpiece, I went home and straight watched this again, cannot recommend enough to avoid the ""live-action"", and rewatch this instead. Amazing, incomparable."	10
 a monumental achievement in the cinema	Disney's masterpiece destined to be worshiped for the future generations. 1994 and here we are, witnessing the spectacle that the cycle of life represents, decades passing by and souls maturing. Yes, they are animals, but that's the point. The world's creation is futile in its banal self-destructiveness, but miraculous in its varied colors, instincts and traits. This is a unique feature film for animation capable of rising all kinds of sentiments to the surface at an exotic rhythm.	10
 A Modern Classic		9
 It does what it says.	I think the reviewers Stuckmann & Jahns will have the 2019 TLK Summer Blockbuster live action version on the worst of list in December.Still here in autumn 2013 the reviews are still coming in.Back then in Christmas 1994 I saw the movie in the cinema, and came back many times for this movie.The movie deserved some Oscars for use of sound.An all star cast are included with names like Whoopi Goldberg that suits her role as the crazy hyena Shenzi.Jeremy Irons does what he can to play the powerful villain that get what he deserved by being assaulted by the hyenas he had control over.Back at the beginning of the movie we see Simba the lion being raised with his family.But Simba's uncle Scar wants to kill Simba's father that is the king.Simba must flee after his father is killed under a wildebeest stampede.Now it's up to Simba as older later on to get revenge on Scar.This is a classic Disney movie with something for everyone.Songs both dark and playful, thrills and funny scenes.10/10	9
 A good movie for all ages	This movie still brings me to tears, even after all of these years! This is one of my favorite Disney movies, ranked high up on the list along with Tangled and Little Mermaid. I am so happy that they finally re-released it on DVD!! I only wish that I had bought it when it was first released on DVD so that I could have gotten the 2 disc special. Although some of the songs are cheesy and others are great, like, I Can't Wait to be King!! I believe that this movie will continue to be a Disney classic. I just hope that my kids will enjoy this movie as much as I always have.Hakuna Matata!	10
 Made a special person's day better	This movie will never get old, no matter how many times we watch it and no matter how old we are. Today it made a dear friend of mine's day better. So, if this movie wasn't made, my friend would be having a sad day, but thanks to the people who made this movie happen, my friend is all good now, and I love anyone who makes my baby girl's day better. When a movie manages to cheer up a person more than 10 years after it was made, then it proves to everyone that it was one successful movie. If you're having a sad day, maybe you should watch this movie. If a friend is having a sad day, maybe you should suggest this movie to them.	10
 A Moralistic Approach in The Lion King	"The Lion King (1994) Movie Review Directed by: Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers The Lion King is more than just a Disney animation. Its two Oscar wins was well-deserved. The main characters – Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa exemplify the different traits present in our society. Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff work together to direct a film that not only shows us the beauty of life and nature, but the moral values we should all seek to sustain who we are. Roger Allers is credited for writing some of the best known Disney classic films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). Robert Minkoff not only directed The Lion King but other movies such as Stuart Little (1999) and The Forbidden Kingdom (2008). These two directors teamed together to play a role in a film that had a moralistic approach. Life is wonderful – don't run away from it, appreciate it and always know family and friends can help you in ways you'd never expect.Looking beyond the obvious characters on screen, each of them can be characterized by a specific expectation. Simba must transition from a young cub (boy) to a leader (adult). Mufasa must rule a land and protect his family; he went as far as he could to protect his son – to the point where he lost his life. Mufasa's fatherly actions teach us that with true love, a parent is willing to exceed limitations to secure his own child. Scar is a representation of evil, greed, and jealousy. He was willing to kill his own brother and nephew to assume a higher rank. He is often portrayed with many high angles, a sign of his dominance and leadership amongst the hyenas and the power he holds over them. Timon and Pumbaa represent the friends who support and guide you when you're troubled. The comedic sense of the duo lightens up the mood of young Simba, giving the viewer reassurance upon Simba's faith and emotions. Nala gives the film a romantic turn, adding on to the idea that love and support can guide someone in the right direction. A major influence that aided the communication in the film was the musical score. In the scene in which Mufasa explains to Simba what the stars in the sky were, a significant musical score plays in the background. This same musical score appears again when Simba is grown and tells Timon and Pumba his father's explanation of the stars. As Simba walks away from his two friends, it presents itself as Simba's remembers his father. This music appears more than once in the film, setting up a connection between previous and present scenes, it was placed at each particular point of the film for a reason. The color and lighting tones between Mufasa and Scar gave way to the differences between them. The darker tones represented Scar's faded thoughts. The little lighting provided in his scenes showed that he was of a sadistic nature whereas Mufasa is presented in brighter lighting among nature and mostly outdoors. Scar is usually located in the interior of a cave or other dwelling – enclosing him in the darkness that eventually drives his jealousy. Cultural aspects of Africa are introduced immediately in the beginning of the film with the first song. The majority of the animals also show the beauty of nature and the variety of animal life that exists. The song ""The Circle of Life"" sets off a major theme of the film – creating the idea that life is a constant circle, there is life and then there is death. After Mufasa dies, a new ruler had to assume his position – Simba. The circle kept going until the film concluded with a new life – the child of Simba and Nala. Once again, the circle has fulfilled its goal of life and death. ""The amazing thing is that I think when we (Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers) made this movie; it's safe to say that we didn't really fully understand the impact this movie was going to have on people.and how long it was going to kind of stick around."" The Lion King shares that universal theme that we are all part of ""the circle of life"", live life with true happiness and do the right thing. Take out time to love those who care and not to back down from fear – face it. Rob Winkoff and Roger Allers may not have realized it when the film was released in 1994, but The Lion King has become a Disney classic, true to the standards of morality and teaching us how magical and complex life is truly is."	9
 best hand-draw animation ever!!!!!	i saw this film when i was 4 years old and i loved it, and now i saw the 3D trailer. and i just back to remember this film. and i saw it again. and i still i loved it. Disney is one of the bigger companies ever made. some films are bad. anothers film are good. others film are awesome. and only one film is the best ever: 2050 and still this movie will be the best from Disney. the music i loved it. Hans simmer is a great composer and musician, Elton john' musics are pretty good. the art direction of the film was great, and the voice talent too, this film is one of the best in history, my mom is 42 years old and she likes this film also my father (53 years old), the people who says that this film is horrible, bad, one of the worst or the worst movie ever. those people are crazy,this is one of the best from Disney.	10
 a shining star in the history of animation	"Personally I enjoy most of Disney movies but this one has a special place for many reasons. The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father ""remember"" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time."	10
" A true masterpiece! Of ""royal"" splendour"	It is everyday that you get a film. However, it is not everyday that you get a film that is original and inspirational. The Lion King is a perfect example of that for it's a masterpiece that I guarantee will entertain people of all ages! The plot is pretty straightforward, but I think it has creativity in every way. It follows Simba, a young lion cub who is destined to become the new king of the African Savannah, after his father, Mufasa. However, Mufasa's jealous brother, Scar wishes to claim the throne for himself and intends to kill both Mufasa and Simba, with the help of a dastardly yet comical pack of hyenas. Going into self-exile when told that he is responsible for his father's death by a planned wildebeest stampede (we all know who really did it, don't we?), Simba grows up while befriending the famous duo, Timon and Pumbaa, then is eventually persuaded to defeat his uncle Scar and become the rightful king. A plot such as this is so compelling, it is uncanny. As for the characters, each and every one of them is brilliantly made, and the voice actors are well chosen, my personal favourites being James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa, Whoopi Goldberg (well known for her role in Sister Act) as the lead hyena Shenzi and the fabulous Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, a hornbill and the king's majordomo. And let's not forget Nathan Lane as Timon and Jeremy Irons as Scar! The rest of the film is equally fantastic. The main reason I love TLK is that its characters are animals, in the African Savannah (I am a big fan of African wildlife)! For those who have not seen The Lion King, watch it! Now! I promise you will praise the film for all it's worth (made even better with its unique and epic soundtrack) and you will not regret watching it. As a conclusion, I give The Lion King a 10 and recommend it highly.	
 The Lion King roars on!	"I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.Hakuna Matata!"	10
 The Best Animated Film I'v Ever Seen	This movie wasn't just another kid's animation movie, It was much more exciting than the other movie's, The Story Was Excellent, Every Character was noticeable and from my sight they was not boring at all, Not even one of them. They Created Simba very childish And naughty, But they also Add to him Innocent and honest. I think most of us like Timon And Pumba, I especially like Timon (Not only because I love meerkats) He's perpendicular and A show off, But there is something about him that easy to like, He's funny Sometime's He's even sensitive, Now Pumba, Thats one lovely warthog! He's so innocent, They add a lot to The Lion King. I'v seen this movie many time's, And every section that Mufasa died, I cried. The music was brilliant, very noticeable, They(Elton John, Tim Rice) Surely deserve an Oscar.The Best Animation Film. Sincerely, BanditIdan from the Bandit's Guild	10
 Amazing!		10
 Great!	Great film! Perfect music, animation, art, cast and story. The best animated motion picture ever! Has it all: adventure, drama, romance and comedy. See it with your own eyes! Based in Bambi and Hamlet. This mix is fantastic. Disney should learn again how to make movies. Forget the Nemos, Chickens and Incredibles junk. This is the film of your life! If you don't have it buy it or rent it. If you have it watch it again! Fall in love with this film!The story of a prince and his growing up... He has to deal with friendship, family, exile, death, envy, power, love, sex, and regret. You will grow with him while you watch this. The greatest story ever told. Forget the usual romantic comedies. This is the film of your life.	10
 Forget every Disney movie you ever witnessed	From the rising sun, to the up roaring film finale the lion king is the Disney film i hold closest to my childhood. I can still remember being 3 years old and getting to the cinema late, and cheering out loud at the end, yeah it would seem that now at the age of 16 turning 17 i'd have seen films a lot more closer to home and i have, but as a young child i was very observant of characters even though they were cartoons. Even though I was only three i never forget the film, I never cried at the sad points of the film and no i never really fully understood it until i watch it a few years later but i always remembered Simba's realisation that his life would never be the same. If you haven't seen the lion king *slap in the face* believe me you are missing what i describe as the last Disney film old Walt would be proud of. 10/10	10
 Disneys best	"The lion king is one of my favourite movies of all time. It is possibly Disney's best movie and is one that any person of any age group will adore. My dad worked for Disney's video department and he got all the great Disney movies and of all of them the lion king is perhaps the best along with Aladdin and toy story. It has the worst Disney villain in the form of scar, has a truly touching story which captivates the watcher and has some of the best Disney characters to date. It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of ""can you feel the love tonight"". Personally i much prefferd and thought that ""the circle of life"" ""I just cant wait to be king"" or ""Hakuna Matata"". This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie as well as toy story followed up a couple of years later. Truly a delight to watch and one of the best movies ever made.You have got to watch it."	10
 One word aww	This is another one of my favourite films it never grows old. It is perfect to all ages. The sound track is absolutely amazing i find myself singing along to all of the songs every time i watch it (nice one Elton). It is one of only two animated films which actually make me cry which i believe is pretty hard for a film to do. Erm it is my childhood film the one that you watch so much the tape began to go weird, it was one of the only films i bought in DVD to replace the tape. It suite's all ages and all sexes. It doesn't matter what kind of films you like you'll love The Lion King. It is ideal for sitting in with a pizza to watch with the family and friends.	10
 The only movie worth 10 of 10!	The intro is better than in any Broccoli-Bond, the plot has a age-span that exceeds 25 years. I watched it together with my daughter, and we both enjoyed the movie but from two different horizons... And the characteristics are better placed than in any heavy Ingmar Bergman-movie.I was seven years old when The Jungle Book first appeared, my daughter was 6 when The Lion King came - suddenly I understood why it is The Greatest Movie I have ever seen.	10
 A Question of Values	"While I don't deny that 'The Lion King'is well animated and has a terrific score, I believe it principally a capitalist parable. Recall the scene where Mufasa walks with Simba through the plains and explains the 'natural order of things'--where the strong prey upon the weak to maintain overall balance and perfection. ""We eat the antelope, the antelope eat the grass, etc."" (trickle-down effect?) And that thrilling opening scene, where all of the animals gather to witness Simba's birth. Isn't there something a little twisted about a bunch of zebras and antelopes gathering to bray joyously about the birth of yet another lion? The lions are the heroes, and we're lead to believe that the establishment rules with an even paw. The underdogs (hyenas) are villains, and when they challenge the established order, the result is chaos and decay. Simba's decision to live the hakuna matata philosophy throws the kingdom's delicate balance out of whack. Only when power returns to the son of the old king is the land restored. The messages? Don't question the established order. It is natural and fair for the strong to take down the weak. Do your job, fulfill your function. It's best if power stays in the same hands for generation after generation. Now, this may be all well and good in the actual ecosystem of the savanna or whatever, but Disney's whole gimmick is to blur the line between animal and human, and give animals human characteristics and values. Don't underestimate the power of these messages--children obsess over animated characters. I remember as a child fighting with my friends over who would get to play 'Cinderella' in our make-believe game. Merchandise (dolls, toys, halloween costumes, spin off books, amusement parks) reinforces the message, serving as a constant reminder. So it's simply a question of what values you want your children to absorb. If they include: social darwinism, unquestioning defense of the status quo, and contempt for the underdog, this is the film for you. Otherwise, I would stick to muppets."	
 Has the Disney magic	The Lion King was the best Disney film of 1994, and perhaps for a few years after. We all know Disney's been hashing up cheap tricks for kids-dumb sequels like Lady and the Tramp 2, Cinderella 2, all that stuff recently. But the Lion King was great, and the all star cast including: Rowan Atkinson, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones really help this film too! Great animation, story, and characters. The Lion King's a great film!3.5/5 STARS-JOHN ULMER	9
 You Are More Than What You Have Become	"So...I'm going to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, ""Lea Halalela,"" is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, ""I want you, lion man.""CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: ""Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like ""It means you are a baboon, and I am not!"" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is ""If he killed him, there'd be no movie."" Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason! Find out for yourself in the big Circle of Life! BOOYIKA!"	9
 The Lion King	The Lion King is acclaimed to be one of the best and if not the best Disney film of all time. Well lets find out. The plot of the movie is about a young cub named Simba and plans on becoming king, but when Simbas evil uncle Scar kills Simbas father Mufasa. Scar tells his hyena henchmen to run Simba out into the jungle and make him never return. Simba makes new friends in the jungle and decides never to return because he rather lives a life with no problems whatsoever. When his childhood friend Nala informs him that Scar has taken over Simba comes back and stops his evil uncle. I personally find the plot very interesting and exiting. It's like you want to know what happens next every moment. Now the moment that everyone remembers and one of Disney's most saddest moment is when Scar lets the stampede out to kill Mufasa. I mean come on haven't we got enough with Bambis Mom! Mufasas death in my opinion is more sad. The main reason is that with Mufasas death there are not any flying birds after it. With Mufasa they keep it silent like if its at a funeral So after watching this film its now clear to me why its called one of the best. In my opinion its not THE best because it does have its flaws here and there./Cough,cough/ Timon and Pumba! Sorry had a couple idiots stuck in my throat. Still, its one of the best, but by a landslide Not the very best.	9
 Best animated Disney movie!	This is my favourite animated Disney movie ever. It has a good plot, good storyline, good characters and good villains. This movie is a must see for any kid and I'm sure a lot of adults enjoy this movie too. Basically its about a lion cub simba who is future king of the pride lands but his uncle scar wants to be king and so forms a plot to kill simba he doesn't succeed in killing simba but instead kills simbas father. Scar convinces simba that it is his fault his father died to simba feeling upset and guilty runs away. Some scenes are funny and some are sad. This is a movie I could watch over and over simply because its a great movie as I have already said a must see for anyone especially Disney fans. I give this movie an 8 out of 10	8
 Favourite Disney classic	To begin with: this movie is worth watching just for the music. The beginning (also optically beautiful) still gives me goosebumps. If anyone ever deserved the Oscar, it was the two guys who got it for this one! Though it's wonderful entertainment, the film also contains some serious topics, like death, taking responsibility and coping with the past. The characters are charming, the romance between Simba and Nala is really cute, and the song lyrics are worth listening twice.A little warning to parents: as I said, this is a perfect Disney classic and really recommendable to both adults and children - only not for very young ones. The scene of Mufasa's death is very sad and touching, and Scar's and Simba's fight at the end could be considered scary.	9
 An emotional masterpiece for all ages	"Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, The Lion King (1994) is a Disney masterpiece. It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.In many parts of the narrative, the audience is completely wrapped up by the magical atmosphere that the film creates, with help from its beautiful original score. In the scene where Mufasa dies, the audience follows Simba, both visually and emotionally, through the discovery of his father's limp body and the acceptance of his passing away. The audience feels the fear and desperation of the little Simba cub as he sees Mufasa motionless on the floor. The audience weeps for Simba as he tries to ""wake up"" his father. Later in the film, when adult Simba meets Nala, the musical accompaniment, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (composed by Elton John) (1994), really creates the romantic mood that devours the audience's heart. When Timon and Pumbaa break the audience out of that oneiric state with their funny antics, and even when they break the fourth wall, they offer a reprieve from the intense emotion present in the rest of the film. These reprieves strengthen the emotions created rather than diminish them. They are an asset to the deep emotions awakened by The Lion King.The use of lions instead of humans might be expected to reduce the emotional intensity of the film, but instead it actually, in some ways, increases it. With animals, the audience experiences defamilarization, as the death of a lion, although still sad, is less taboo and tragic than a death of human. If human Scar had murdered human Mufasa, the audience would experience boundless hate for Scar, rather than experiencing the sadness of Simba as it was supposed to. Using animals also made the diegesis much more colorful and kid-friendly. Using human characters would have created a whole other unwanted experience.Aside from the emotional aspect of the film, The Lion King also disguises a powerful social statement. At the end of the film, the child of Simba and Nala is declared the heir of the pride, as Simba was at the beginning of the film. This metaphorically completes ""The Circle of Life"" (also composed by Elton John) (1994), the title of the opening score. The audience learns that Mufasa's death was inevitable, and sooner or later Simba will die too. Death must happen to complete the cycle, and the past should not be clung on to. This important message is what makes The Lion King more than a simple narrative and a delight for 5-year-olds and 50-year-olds alike.The Lion King was made 17 years ago, yet still stands as an artful classic, despite it being an animation movie. This is a result of the intense emotional experience that an audience can't help but be enveloped by, and a powerful life lesson that is delivered flawlessly. Throughout the action, romance, and sudden comedy, the audience follows without any difficulty at all, and at the end, learns a valuable lesson. The choice to use animals also benefited the film. Aside from making the film more kid-friendly, it precisely manipulated the audience's feelings. The Lion King is a shining gem in film history, a gem that will truly stand the test of time.The Lion King will remain one of my favorite films for a long time, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should."	9
 1994	I was born when this movie was released. I am, therefore, blessed. One of Disney's finest productions ever 'nuff said.	10
 gooddd	Love. great detailed animation. WATCH THE LION KING BRO	10
 A masterpiece	Arguably Disney's best film of all time, the Lion King is beautifully set in the African Serengeti. The soundtrack is perfect, the dialogue is excellent, and the voice performances by the actors are top notch. As an adult, I appreciate the humor that I missed as a kid and that is what sets this film apart; it can be watched by audiences of all ages. James Earl Jones was most fitting as Mufasa, as were the rest of the actors in their roles. A true epic.	10
 Love this movie	My favorite childhood movie! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a classic Disney movie to watch. Can never go wrong with The Lion King.	10
 The only true king	For me the original is always better than the reboot. But this has such an emotional impact. Great.	10
 This is easily the best film ive ever seen	And how surprising is it that it was made by the same company who made endgame, the remake however was a complete dumpster fire	10
 A Disney classic		10
 It places itself among the best animated productions of all time.	Oscillating between big and colorful, the newest member of the Disney Renaissance marks a higher mark in terms of the stakes of the animation house, with a grand and epic story that possesses all the great Shakespearean traits, as well as the beautiful animation and the scope behind it, filled with charming, catchy and memorable songs, an amazing score, a worthy voice-casting and the best and unique elements every single animated flick should showcase, all in amazing-great deliverance.	10
 The art form of Animation at its Finest!	The Lion King is an artistic masterpiece. The combination of different colors and shapes portraying this Shakespearean story result in a cinematic experience you will not want to miss. All of the characters leave an impact on the audience through the beautiful character development and relationships. This makes the meat of the film engaging and heart-breaking.Mufasa's death scene is sad, because we sympathize with Simba and his father's relationship that was previously established. Some consider it to be the saddest scene in cinema history, and I can't argue against that. When Nala finds Simba after many years of sorrow in the Pride Land, their love which was foreshadowed at the beginning feels deserved and romantic. Even as a kid I always found that scene compelling.The main thing that makes this story and the characters work is the animation. Nobody would have cried over Mufasa's death if we couldn't see Simba's emotion portrayed in the animation. Every character is personified, because in animation you are able to do this. This is why I am not excited at all for the Live Action remake. You can't take away emotion from the movie and expect the audience to relate. Disney remaking their animated films in live action in general is not a good artistic idea. It is always a downgrade from the original, because you cannot portray emotion on inanimate objects or animals in the real world. That is why the animated versions are always better.But in the end, even though the live action version will most likely be terrible, at least we still have the beauty of the original.	9
 Rating: A+	"If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn't seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you're one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I'm just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don't really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven't notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That's how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can't simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia's tears. Mufasa's tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole ""remember who you are"" speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer's score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It's one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an ""okay"" scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a ""good"" movie turn into a ""great"" one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn't that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.During the stampede sequence, the score doesn't lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It's that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it's solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba's roar ... Damn it, I'm crying again!The animation is some of Disney's best. It's not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone's childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There's no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they're feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone's wallpaper even today.The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, ... Every single song is someone's favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career's biggest role, Darth Vader isn't the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character's voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who's the ""bad guy"", and that's unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It's true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba's journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it's a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can't just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.It's a masterpiece! It doesn't matter if it's an animated film. It doesn't matter if it was ""made for kids"". People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it's undeniably one of Disney's best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs ... The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its ""live-action"" remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again."	10
 The best of Disney animation.	With its remarkable narrative, memorable characters, stunning animation, and brilliant music, The Lion King remains the very pinnacle of Disney's animated achievements.	10
 The King, Has Returned	What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.The animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.The characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.The music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.It has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.All in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period.	10

 A Must-Watch Movie	This classic title is a must-watch for everybody. The Lion King is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen.

The animated wilderness, great story line, voice acting and the awesome original sound tracks create a perfect blend for an animated film.	10

 One of the best animated films of all time	I have been watching this film since I was very young and I still enjoy it very much to this day and will never get bored of it! The film manages to fulfil everything you could hope for in an animation film: great visuals, catchy songs, likeable and memorable characters, a villain that you love to hate,unexpected plot twists and more! The Lion King is an amazing film for everyone even those who tend to stay away from animated films. If you haven't watched it already please do! Disney did a fantastic job on this one.	10
 Best kids movie of all time	This is arguably the greatest movie ever. So many life lessons to be learned from this movie.	10
 In June 1994, Disney unveiled what would become one of its most beloved animated titles, The Lion King.		10

 A Film that Animated Film Makers today should take notes from.	"Lion King is not only an animation masterpiece but a film masterpiece overall. The technique of cinematography and visual story telling used in Lion King is some of the best seen in Film. Each scene provides a purpose to strike an emotion within you. Complimented by the outstanding soundtrack, the story can be easily told without a word being said, although the characters voice actors and dialogue is just as good. The animation is fluid and beautiful and feels life like in every frame. Lion King is easily some of Disney's best two-dimensional animation work.The cast is charming, memorable, and their personalities never feels forced or unnecessary. Their voice actors all feel appropriate and their voices distinguish them perfectly, making them feel alive with personality. Each of the characters have their place and don't get in the way of one another with their importance to the plot. At the same time, the characters are never just there for the party. They all contribute to the overall plot and they're all likable in their own rights.Simba, the main character, is the perfect token example of character growth and development throughout The Lion King. Simba starts a curious child and as he grows and discovers more about who he is, he becomes the hero of the story. Nala, while the romance is not the main focus of the story, is the perfect contrast to Simba to allow him to grow and mature after his father is gone. Her character allows Simba's growth to shine and develop the pivitol theme of the story.Scar is an amazing villain, to say the least. He sadistic, yet charming personality, and foul selfish character, makes him an excellent memorable villain.Comedic Relief in the Lion King is perfectly done. The characters, Timon and Pumbaa, being the film's more lighthearted and comedic personalities are done with subtlety. Many times a comedic relief character can feel forced and irritating but Lion King approached these two and added more emotional depth to them. Their reactions and dialogue is appropriate to the scenario and they're much better characters for it.While I do enjoy Lion King the most of all animated films, nothing is absolutely perfect and neither is The Lion King. Luckily, most of the cons with The Lion King are mostly nit picks.The effects that the villain, Scar, had on Pride Rock were not shown until the end of the film. There was much build up to Scar taking over pride rock but after he had taken over he was not shown in the film for quite some time.The third hyena character of the hyena trio, Ed, is nothing more than a stereotypical funny idiot character. He's only supposed to be ""funny"" because he is an idiot. This is a one-dimensional, and forgettable character.Simba's mother, Sarabi, had very few screen time. This is a flaw in my opinion, as she was the last thread of leadership for the Pride Rock lions under scar's rule aside from Nala. It would've added more to her character and would have made her more memorable of a character. Aside from these few nitpicks, The Lion King is absolute masterpiece and should be regarded as such. The Lion King is a film, modern animated film makers should be taking notes from."	10
 What can you say besides Amazing?	Oje of the best animations ever made and probably the best made by Disney	10
 Love	Absolutely love the lion king, it is a must see for people of all ages and genders	10
 One of Disney's Finest and Set to be an All-Time Classic	With a great story, great actors and Disney magic, nothing can go wrong . Factor in good soundtrack scores and what do you have ? An all-time masterpiece up there with Jungle Book, Mary Poppins and Fantasia.	10
 Disney Classic.	This movie has everything a great film needs, loveable protagonists, and evil villain, perfect music (won the oscar), a great message, great comedy, emotion and truly ground breaking animation. Iv loved this movie almost my entire life.	10
 Heart Warming movie for all ages.	"""The Lion King"" is a classic movie that can be loved by all genders and age demographics. It's makes you laugh, cry, and want to sing along. The animations are just a stepping stone into the amazing movie magic that we see today on the big screen. Truly a movie that will be a favorite for decades to come."	10
 The Lion King is one of Disney's greatest animated musicals.		9
 Classic	I've watched this movie countless amount of times and it never gets old. The characters and the storyline is incredible. Great for all ages.	9
 Best cartoon movie all time	I was watched lion king 1998. But I remember it sooo long time. It's very wonderful story & cartoon.	9
 Disney Classic	Undoubtedly a classic family movie that has meaning and enjoyment in store for all ages.	9
 One of the best animated films ever!	I don't remember what the pre-release hype was like back then for this, but I saw this movie that summer and I enjoyed it. So many interesting characters with an East African setting and such a gripping plot. It does have its parallels with the old Egyptian myth of Osiris and Set, and Osiris's son Horus, but as a fan of animated movies, this is the one with all the best actors and actresses lending their voices. Especially James Earl Jones. This and Mulan (1998) are among my favorite Disney films. If you've wanted to see African animals and a good story with memorable characters, don't miss this!	9
 A Classic	What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said? On every level, it is perfect until Simba is exiled, then I believe the film devolves only slighting. The character development, plot, humor, and animation are all on point. I only issue, which is small, is the predictability of the plot after Simba leaves, destined to return. The message is clear and good: Do not forget who you are/where you came from. 9/10 (almost perfect)	8
 Not a personal favorite, but no one can deny its brilliance.		10
" ""The Lion King""- An epic animated movie"		10
 Beautiful movie	I agree with the above opinions, the film is a wonderful story about love and friendship. It is dedicated at people of all ages. The plot is surprising and interesting. While watching, the viewer can feel attaches to the character. Dialogues are very funny at times, but there are also sad moments that cause some tears. Ideal film for the whole family, but also for lonely evenings. Despite many years, animations in this film look beautiful and surprisingly fresh. The music used in the movie is also great. This movie has been a huge success for Disney. I think everyone should see him at least once.	10
 Master piece	Definitely a classic! This movie will go on and on through generations without getting old and without even one person who won't fell in love with it. Love the animation, the plot, the songs and everything. Essential movie for anyone ever on Earth. Will remain one of the great master pieces of animation. Just enjoy it and Hakuna Matata!	10
 nostalgia	A movie I watched at very young ages. It's a beautiful masterpiece that I make different meanings in each age. The universality of his subject makes the film constantly up-to-date and traceable. It is a beautiful masterpiece that brings new meaning to every view. The lion king in short	10
 Disney's best		10
 All time favorite	This is a must watch movie if you have not seen or heard about it!! Grew up with it. Laughed, cried, trembled as a kid. ^ still do that as an adult ha ha... WATCH OR BUY THE MOVIE!! I don't know what else to type because it is so amazing and the plot is full of (I don't want to spoil it) you'll love this movie. I have re watched this movie over 78 times to be exact. I have one DVD for this movie in my friend's house, three in my house (two for backup), one in my grandparents' and I am a crazy fan for this movie so please do not judge ha ha. The Lion King as a whole is a movie for you if you like to watch movies about growing up and authority in the real life world.	10
 Good film.	In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba.	10
 it was a awesome movie !	"great movie i v ever seen ! and it I inspirational too ... love it <3 ;) the story is => This retelling of ""The Lion King"" is conveyed from the perspective of market Timon (Nathan Lane) and warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and shows how the pair became friends. When Timon leaves his colony because he doesn't fit in, he meets the lonely Pumbaa. Together Timon and Pumbaa search for a new home, having adventures along the way and eventually meeting up with lion prince Simba (Matthew Broderick), who is in exile from his home and must challenge the evil Scar for the title of Lion King. really i enjoyed the movie very much and its a impressive movie also <3 i will never forgot these memories Most interest thing my nieces fab movie I lion king The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation; it finished its run as the highest-grossing release of 1994. Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US $968 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest- grossing hand-drawn animated film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States, the sixth highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the 29th-highest-grossing feature film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and the prequel/parallel The Lion King 1½ (2004)—and two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard.The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings.The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence."	10
 My favorite cartoon!	My favorite cartoon! This is a story about family, love and friendship. As in life, is found in the betrayal, but good always triumphs over evil. And evil will always be punished. It is instructive cartoon. My children will definitely be watching it! Simba is shown here as a loyal and loving son, who so faithfully loves his father. I cried when Simba cried. Incredible sensations. I believe that such cartoons should be more. A lot more. It's not just a cartoon, it's the whole story! Disney knows how to create something wonderful. I don't know what else to say here. This cartoon was included in the era, and children of any generation will watch it with joy. I believe in it.	10
 Absolutely Amazing!!!		9
 A young Lion comes into his own	"This film remains one of my very favorites. The journey of loss, growth and redemption plays out extremely well. Love it even to this day.If you have young children, you probably know the plot but I will not spoil that in this review. The voice actors are awesome in their delivery and really drives the emotions home. The story is not an original trope, but it still holds well in the test of time. If you haven't seen this film in a while, you should check this out with a new generation of fans. This movie makes for a good family night film or a good conversation piece among a group of film and animation enthusiasts. Again, a great film for the whole family. Enjoy and ""Hakuna Matada"" I think that's right."	10
 Regele Leu	This is really the best Disney movie.... it contains everything, drama, romance, action...everything to make you happy and to motivate you watching this. I cried on the movie, I laughed, I was worried, I was wondering... this Disney movie makes you to pass through every feeling when you are watching it, respect that, no many movies, special Disney movies are good like this one. Nowadays are no more Disney movies such this one, I just hoping for more like. I don't know why he have this rate .... I guess just because it's Disney movie because the movie is really perfect... but the Disney part I guess put it down, I gave it 10/10 my opinion is very very positive about this Disney movie and I hope you gonna watch it too guys, it deserve to be watched and rated.Respect	10
 Best Disney movie ever!	"This is my favorite Disney animated movie of all time. The opening scene with all of the animals and ""The Circle of Life"" is breathtaking. Right from the start you want to know the story of the adorable baby lion. It has very memorable characters including Simba of course, and Timon and Pumba are hilarious sidekicks. As a child I remember being frightened by the villain, Scar. The music is by far the best part of this movie. After all these years, I can still sing along. ""Hakuna Matata,"" which means no worries, will be a favorite for many. I use ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" as a lullaby for my baby. I recommend this movie to all families with children 5 and up."	10
 The greatest animated family movie of all times!!!	In comparison to every other Disney (which makes -in my opinion- the greatest productions in animated movies) film, is the top of the tops! Every meaning that tries to pass to the viewer is going right to the feelings, no matter the age! I think that it is quite educational for every person who watches that!Despite it analyzes an animal kingdom, you can easily locate a man society in which everyone tries to be on the highest level without calculating the other ones, no matter if they are relatives or friends or anything else. Important values presented in this movie such as friendship, co-operation, love, anti-racism messages and -of course- family! Last but not least, is the music of the film. I think is the most well-produced animated movie of all times and -even today- well-timed! 10/10 no doubts!	10
 Excellent! Highly recommended! Wonderful for all ages!	This movie will always bring tears to my eyes, no matter how many times I see it! It s a great movie, as for children and as for adults! I will not get tired to re-watch it. I have seen it like six times and still not bored. The moment when Simba's father, Mufasa, died, i could not stop from crying. The other movies, the following ones were great, but not compared to this one. This movie contains valuable lesson upon life too. If you have not seen this movie by now, you are lucky because it is a great movie and the quality time you will be spending for the first time you watch this tear jerking movie will be awesome. I took my 8 year old daughter to see the show. It was amazing. The cast was excellent. The way the theater transformed after different scenes was breathtaking. The entire story was captivating. We never felt bored or lost. From the opening to closing scene we were at the edge of our seats. My gosh I never experienced anything like this before. I would encourage every and anyone to see this show. It was such an amazing experience that my daughter & I decided to see at least 2 Broadway shows a year. The Lion King will always be special to us. Everyone involved in this spectacular production should be proud.	10
 Best Disney Film Ever	I remember watching this when I was 3 on VHS. It was the best. Although, I didn't quite get the whole Mufasa death till I was maybe 7 or 8. Now Every time I re-watch it, it makes me cry. It also depresses me on how Simba thinks it's all his fault. But then he grows up and Nala finds him. She tells him what Scar has done to Pride Rock,Simba becomes all fierce and sexy. Then Simba goes back with Nala and brings Timon and Pumbaa with him. The diversion that Timon and Pumbaa create is hilarious. If I could watch it on VHS again, I would. Also if you're looking for a Disney film for a younger child, I would suggest this one.	10
 Best American movie of all time	"There are too many good things to say about this movie. Even though it is technically an original story by Disney, I personally consider it the definitive version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. And they don't even sugar coat it that much. Not like in Bambi, where they just hint at the mother dying. Here you actually SEE the body. The characters are all likable, all the way down to the two best, Timon and Pumbaa. As a kid, I always found them incredibly funny. The villain is probably for me the best Disney has ever done as well. Scar really has that clever acting of Jeremy Irons and his interaction with James Earl Jones is extremely believable. And I real like the clever message it's sending through the scene with Rafiki and Simba. ""The past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or... learn from it."" The songs are all memorable, even down to my favorite ""Circle of Life"" and the animation is a brilliant combination of traditional with a little CG thrown here or there. God bless this movie. It is nothing short of an epic masterpiece."	10
 SuperCalafFagalisticExpialadoshus	"""The water hole?"" I can watch this movies over and over and over again. I can sing the songs on karaoke and quote lines from top to bottom. Hands down!!! The best movie since I was a kid....""I'm gonna be a mighty Queen, so enemies beware..."" I had this classic on VHS and then on DVD, now Blue-Ray. This is one of those movies that you sit down and watch with your babies and then you pass it along.The storyline was awesome: Very good life lessons about trust, family true friendship, and love that is genuine. This movie depicts the importance of wisdom and the law of sowing and reaping. The vocal tactics were superior and the vocal acting was phenomenal. James Earl Jones is a winner every time."	
 The Best Animation!!!	The Lion King is one of Disney film that I've watched many times. I really enjoyed it, since I was in grade 3. It is a great film, also very well-made. This is the film that can be entertaining in any ages. It was funny, emotional, and had family drama. And the songs are all nice and meaningful. The whole story had explained that what life is, how to be strong throughout the problems in life and the way to getting peace.The King Mufasa has told his son to be brave when he had to be. I really liked the sentence, and that's what my dad had always told me.Simba tried his best to be strong after his father had killed by Scar and Scar had forced him to run out of the Pride Land. Under control of Scar, the Pride Land has no food, no water.After Simba became an adult, he comes back to fight with Scar to get the Pride Land back. Then, the Pride Land becomes as before and peacefully.The Lion King is the best movie ever for every ages <3 <3	10
 Even better than 'Frozen'	My favourite Disney movie of all time. I watched this again recently with my young children and I was just as gripped as when I watched it as a child myself.I found myself singing the songs with my daughter afterwards.The animation is truly wonderful. Although this film is 20 years old I'm not sure they could have made it any more impressive today. The full majesty of Africa, the terror and exhilaration of the wildebeest stampede, the colours and the sounds - it's exhilarating.The story is a fairly typical Disney one of a kid who loses his way before remembering what it means to have responsibility. But that's fine by me.This is a movie to make you feel good and re-live a child-like sense of awe and wonder.	9
 Greatest Disney movie of all time	Wisely said one of the greatest films of all time.... this Disney classic has won many awards because it's great. It has everything to make a good film. A setting, characters, plot, and an adventure that makes it the greatest, if not, one of the greatest films of all time history. It is a film that has horror, drama, adventure, comedy, and EVERY GENRE! The horror part comes from the terrifying deaths. But this Disney classic is the greatest movie that Disney ever pulled out of their pocket. I recommend everybody sees this amazing movie. Obviously the greatest film of 1994 and even possibly the best film of the 90's. It has no reason to be skipped or given a bad rating, this movie does have many sequels but they're pretty bad, this is the one you should be focusing on.	10
 Never Listen to Your Sketchy Uncle	"The story opens well and makes you begin to care for the animals who live at Pride Rock. You feel like Symba is kind of spoiled (even though there are only 3 male lions in all the Pride Lands). The story introduces Nala and Symba's relationship as ""just friends"" which we all know that in a Disney Movie it means they will get married by the end. When Mufasa died, the world cried. Next, the third male lion takes over Pride Rock (since no other males are there to challenge him.) Symba has been forced to live with two hooligans in the wild growing up eating bugs. That is not healthy for a growing lion. He needed real meat, which is probably why Symba was a lot smaller than his dad. When Symba finally comes back, him and the lionesses fight with an army of thousands of hyenas, somehow winning. But who cares! Scar is eaten alive for his betrayal of the hyenas and eventually the damage of years of drought and fire and famine are replaced in a very short amount of time. They all lived happily ever after. The movie The Lion King was an excellent movie that could be watched many times over. It gave amazing life lessons, like how to find who you are and never to listen it your sketch uncle. Over all this movie can emotionally move pretty much everyone, if it doesn't then you likely have no soul."	10
 Lion cub finds identity and returns to be King,		10
 Spoiler	This is the better film i ever see. I cry very much when lion die. i recommend this film for my children's and my little sister. Have the bests musics. My best character is Scar he is the Brother of Mufasa . Envious of his brother , dreams of taking his place as king ; with the help of hyenas, kill Mufasa and Simba expelled from the lands of the kingdom, becoming king but i don't like him because he is mad and did much harm to others lions he wants to be the king but fortunately he can no. I think everyone in the world should see this film, makes think of life.I think almost everyone who saw the film cried. But i really love this film	10
 A CLASSIC Disney MOVIE	I watched this movie at the theater when I was 6 years old and I am now 25 years old. This movie is one of the select movies that will truly stand the test of time. The storyline is truly captivating. Disney always makes such quality movies, but this makes you think very deeply about life. I will pass this film down to generations to come. The characters are so well thought out and there is humor, grief and integrity all rolled into one. To anyone that has not watched this, please do ensure to watch this Disney classic. You will be captivated throughout the entire duration. A soulful, yet effervescent delight.	10
 Hakuna Matata!		10
 The Lion King is a movie about a young lion prince who runs away from home, but who returns as an adult to save the lands from the claws of an evil new king.		10
 Brilliant story line	Excellent movie which I would cherish all through my life. The whole movie is well scripted with screenplay smoothly flowing like a river. The narrators have given life to the characters through their graceful voices. This movie was a benchmark for all the animated cartoons featured later in the history of films. The movie revolves around the emotions of father lion towards its cub and vice versa. This movie is definitely one among st the favorites of 90's kids. I was really moved and touched by the climax sequence and the scene where the dad lion will be assassinated.Though there are sequels made, my favorite still remains this one.	8
 Through despair and hope	When marketing The Lion King for the first time way back in 1994, Disney made the brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments. The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen. The story is a simple if not effective one, drawing upon similar themes from Hamlet. It's a tale of Simba's quest for redemption and revenge after being falsely exiled for his father's death. The traditional coming of age plot is well paced and is earmarked by several deeply emotional moments, the most significant of those being Simba's grief at the realisation of his father's death (Jonathan Taylor Thomas's voice acting in this scene is heartbreaking). There's plenty of emotional depth in the portrayal of Simba through the themes of ostracization, loss, guilt and growing up which makes this film appropriate for both adult and children alike. The Lion King has a rightful place in Disney's elite as a vibrant, poignant and visually immersive film.	9
 Greatest Movie ever made!	"The Lion King is not only my favorite Disney movie, it's my favorite movie PERIOD. The film was a major box office success and won several academy awards, including ""Best Original Song"". And for darn good reason. I have loved The Lion King from the moment I first watched it as a kid. The good stuff in this film is really good. Oh, man, where do I begin? First of all, the story. I like how this movie isn't based on a book or fairy tale. I also love how this film manages to accomplish a pretty solid story when there are no people in this movie, just animals. Now that I mentioned that, I should say that the characters are memorable. Simba is fun to watch, particularly as a kid. Mufasa is also a very like able character. The hyenas are funny and Timon and Pumbaa make great comic relief. Scar was also a very well-done villain. The voice-acting here is terrific. All the actors play who they are supposed to be perfectly. I also loved the animation in this movie. This is the best-looking hand-drawn animated film. It looks best in scenes like the opening scene, the stampede, and the battle between Simba and Scar. I also LOVED the songs. Every one is great to listen to, and my favorite is ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"". I don't know what more to say. I adore it. I've seen it a million times and plan on watching it a million times more."	10
 As Good As It Gets!	This movie truly is a classic and one of the best films I have ever seen, even after 21 years since its release. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious and so is Rafiki the baboon.The story of growing up between Simba and Mufasa is especially touching and can teach a lot to us today. And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great. This movie has a great voice cast, awesome animation, a great storyline, and as with all of the early to mid 90s Disney films, an absolutely perfect soundtrack.Truly deserving of its tag as Disney's best film until Frozen, it will always be a classic to me.	10
 i love this movie	Honestly I have a cousin with a mental disorder who would watch this movie over and over and at that time my mother was pregnant with me and ever since i was born i grew up watching both The Lion King and Lion King 2 and i'm 16 almost 17 and i still watch this movie like a thousand times. I love how they show us many different morals in life in a unique way; like when Mufasa explains the circle of life to Simba and how we are all one. Also when Mufasa explains to Simba that There will be a time where he has to leave (death) and Simba would have to take over. Mufasa also shows that it takes great responsibility to be King and there are moments where even the brave get scared. It also shows that when we're young we get carried away with growing up and we want to change things when we grow up but when we get older then we realize the purpose on why it was the way it is. Finally teaching running away from your problems isn't the solution because it will catch up to you (when Nala goes to look for food in the oasis where Simba had been living since he ran away)	10
 Loved it!	"I absolutely loved this movie. I've loved it since I was a child and I still love it now. Definitely makes me cry every time I watch it. Damn it. I love the concept of the movie and I love the characters. The characters are very different and each have their own personality. My favorite characters are definitely Timon and Pumbaa. ""It means no worries, for the rest of your days. It's our problem free, philosophy, Hakuna Matata."" I even re-watched the movie when it came back out into theaters in 3D! It was absolutely fantastic. I don't think I could ever get sick of this movie. Absolutely loved it. Emotional, thrilling (in a good way), and a great classic Disney movie."	10
 Music Lovers Must See	The Lion King movie is a great Disney must see for children and adults. The music is wonderful and the story is great ! I think any music lover will appreciate this film. The colors in the film are beautiful. I have watched the Lion King numerous times and now own the DVD. I would advise any Disney fan to see this movie. Also the DVD purchase would be a great gift for any Disney fan. The story in the Lion King is easy to follow and suspenseful for children and adults. The part in the movie when the father dies is quite sad and may make smaller children upset. The words in the music are catchy and fun to sing along with. My favorite song in the movie is Hakuna Mata.	
" ""...we are all connected in the great circle of life""."	"If this came out when I was a kid it would have been my favorite Disney film. My generation had ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955) and ""101 Dalmations"" (1961). Me, I was always fascinated by wild animals and when it comes to lions, the idea that they were the 'King of Beasts' was icing on the cake. That's why I never missed a Tarzan or Jungle Jim flick when they came on TV back in the day.Well I'm not a kid anymore, so I guess there's no reason to qualify it. This can still be my favorite Disney movie. There are some good lessons here for youngsters, the whole circle of life business and the idea that being brave doesn't mean you have to go looking for trouble. Animation wise it resembles a lot of the older Disney pictures, only natural since it was the last of their hand drawn features. There's a simplicity to the style that's missing from the high tech wizardry of present day animated films. I don't think that means there's a better or worse here, times and technology change so why not movies.Cool comical characters like Timon and Pumbaa, and regal heroes like Mufasa and the adult Simba make this a fun picture. I especially liked the scene where Simba as a cub stepped in his father's footprint making him realize he had big paws to fill someday. The conflict with Scar and the hyenas was positioned well to help Simba understand that early failure is not indicative of future success. Colorful, quick paced and energetic, ""The Lion King"" is a delightful film experience."	8
 My favorite Disney film	"The year was 1994, I was a 7 year old boy watching The Lion King for the first time in the theater. I'll never forget how amazed I was by the opening chants and visuals that were being displayed. This film has a special place in my heart and will be a favorite in many hearts for generations to come. The animation, music, story, and characters were just too awesome. I still remember my brother and his pregnant girlfriend taking me to see this and I kept praying and thinking ""please don't let her go into labor during this film"", didn't want to miss this instant classic. Even at 17, I still remember purchasing this on DVD with a bunch of rolled up quarters I grabbed from my dads coin stash. I have this movie on VHS,DVD, Blu Ray and in 3D Blu Ray; now if I could only find it in film..."	10
 A masterpiece	One of the most famous and beautiful Disney's movie. It's a perfect mixture of friendship, family, honor, reputation, hope and justice. Perfect for everyone, not just for children. I believe that each of us has cried in the scene where Simba's father is killed by Scar, and everyone rejoiced at the end of the movie when Simba gets justice. Each of us also laughed in every scene with Timon and Pumba. Two very different animals but this does not prevent them from being friends. One of the best lessons for life: Hakuna Matata, no worries.In my opinion the best Disney song of all time: It teaches us not to take everything too seriously and be free.	9
 The Best Movie Ever!!!	If I'm only able to choose one movie to carry with me when the world ends, This Is It! The Lion King contains a great number of excellent elements; its story, characters, and music are all phenomenal. And the most important of all, it shows us what bravery, love, friendship, and loyalty are through a impressive, touching, and funny way. This is the movie you can use to teach your children what's really vital in their lives, and you can also watch it again and again when you grow up as well, even when you're 90. Believe me, you'll still find countless fun in it. Hakuna Matata!	10
 Really Best Animated Film Ever!	"I love this movie! As it is not just a great movie for animation buffs. But also for the entire family. As it is one of the best movies ever made and no wonder it is really a hit with the IMDb 250 best top movies.The protagonist Simba, after being ran out of his homeland of Pride Rock, from the antagonist, Scar. After Scar was jealous of Simba's father Mufasa, who was king. Therefore he has the hyenas kill him so that Scar can be king after Mufasa was thrown to his death.After Simba who really would be king after he grew up runs into the two comic reliefs of the film, Timon a meerkat and Pumbaa a warthog. And lives the carefree lifestyle of ""Hakuna Matata!"" After a former girlfriend of his, Nala whom he rescues his new friends from. Is informed of Scar's being king and not enough food or resources due to Scar's hoarding it to himself and the hyenas.Now faced with this and with the help also of his wise mentor, mandrill Rafiki as Simba must face Scar and take his rightful place as king.Really one of the best movies I have ever seen! Even my parents, whom my dad is not a fan into cartoon movies loved it too.About love and hope and also with humor along the way!"	10
 No worries this is a classic		8
 The Lion King 3D: a reissue that feels like a new release		
 Great Family Movie	This is a great family movie that takes viewers through and makes us think about the circle of life. It makes us think about how our choices affect those around us. It might bring up the idea of death a little early for real young children. Mufasa's death while tragic shows a father's love and what he will do to protect his child all the while showing how greed and the need for power (Skar) can destroy families (in this case the pride). Yes, it is cartoon form, and this takes the edge off the subject since they are fictional characters. Yet the subject is there opening up discussion about our choices and how selfish choices do gain us short term gain from time to time the choices to help others will benefit us for a lifetime. A great movie for kids and adults alike.	
 A truly beautiful Disney classic.	The Lion King spoke to me as soon as I saw it. It spoke to me as nothing less than a majestic adventure. Beautifully done on every level; from the music by Elton John or the whole story. I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day. Even amongst films in general, this one still holds its own as a classic and I think it will remain very powerful for a long stretch of time.	9
 Childhood Gem	"Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas ""Cinderella"", ""Beauty and the Best"", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well.how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.And as if having Hans Zimmer score the film wasn't a grand achievement in itself, Elton John and Tim Rice add to the score beautifully. The end result is a tale so epic if you look at it from a glance it evokes the scope of a Greek tragedy. In fact, amongst the many over-rated Disney Renaissance era films, this is one of the few where I can watch it again and again without ever tiring of it."	10
 A timeless classic... a truly magnificent achievement of the art of making movies	"I first watched The Lion King when I was just a small child and I absolutely loved it. But it's now, in my mature years, I realize what an amazing movie it is, not just in the animation category but overall.The blend of the great storyline, amazing visuals, moving scenes (Mufasa's death scene still gets to me to this day and Mufasa appearance in the clouds talking to Simba was epic), enchanting music, and colorful characters is truly an achievement that is almost never seen these days....I recommend The Lion King to all ages, everyone on earth must be able to experience this landmark of a movie where not one moment is dull, no eyes will be dry, and no one won't get the ""chills""."	10
 A Truly Epic Disney Classic.	This amazing Disney film has all the makings of a classic. Great animation, excellent music, likable characters, and a great story. These are the type of movies I grew up with. I watched this film with my little sister a few days ago and it gave me goosebumps. This was Disney at its finest.It's sad however, for it seems that Disney's time has passed. Chicken Little, Home on the Ranch, Meet the Rbinsons, Bolt? These aren't necessarily bad films, but they are hardly on par with this film. The Lion King will be one of those classics that will stand the test of time.	10
 A fine animated story with lively characters and lovely music!	One of those 90’s classics that I had enjoyed during my schooldays was a beauty to watch again recently. Though the story is just an odd family drama where the less capable brother overthrows the king by deceit while his son runs away; only to return years later to undo the injustice and regain his throne. Where “Lion King” excels is getting this story out of animated animals and put in a way that kids would love.Pride Rock in Africa is where the earth is green and animals live in peace in the reign of the great lion Mufasa (James Earl Jones) who is assisted by an old wise monkey Rafiki and a loyal bird Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Plotting with the hyenas, Scar (Jeremy Irons) causes a wildebeest stampede and kills Mufasa while Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/ Matthew Broderick) takes the blame for putting his father in fatality’s way.Consequently, Simba runs away to a distant land where he grows up in the company of Timon, a meerkat and Pumba a warthog, characters so lively that their “Hakuna Matata”, the no-worry song is one of its biggest hits with its infectious positivity. In a chance encounter with his former playmate and destined lover Nala reminds him of his unfinished business at home. Wiser now, Simba returns to claim his due!Made in times that can nostalgically be remembered as the days when animation still had the old artistic beauty with just the right mix of CGI. “Beauty and the Beast” and “Anastasia” too come from a similar time and won accolades for their Music. Though its sequels or games weren’t too appealing, the original is still a masterpiece. You can’t just miss those adorable characters, each filled with life and character! No description of “Lion King” can be complete without a befitting praise to its songs. While Hans Zimmer won the Oscar for the best score, Elton John’s Can You Feel the Love Tonight in the credits is its best song. The judicious mix of African vocals in “Circle of Life” the deep darkness of “Be Prepared” and childish fun of “Can’t wait to be king” keep ringing much after the movie is over and even after years pass by! With its short runtime of just over an hour, it doesn’t take away much of your time but doesn’t at all fail to take you into itself. Neatly edited, there is never a time that you get bored with it. Though technology has moved light years after Lion King, I’d still say that if you have missed watching it back then, better run and grab the DVD!	8
 A Masterpiece	"This is an absolutely amazing animated movie, one of the best ever created. Who can say they didn't cry when Mufasa died. That is one of the most beautifully tragic scenes in cinema history. It is so great when kids movies include something that really evokes emotion and heart. Another classic scene is the final battle between Simba and Scar. It is a great climax to everything that lead up to it.Then there's Simba's birth and presentation. It is beautiful on the edge of the cliff in front of all the other animals. The characters are all great in this film and the soundtrack is one that everyone knows and remembers. I don't think I could think of another movie that has so many well known, original songs featured in it. ""The Lion King"" is rated in my top three animated kids movies along with ""The Brave Little Toaster"" and The Land Before Time"". It is truly a work of art."	10
 An American Classic.	The Lion King has always served as my all time favorite movie. It captures the childhood memories you long for as you continuously grow older. It's simplistic ability to entertain and provoke joyful feelings is something rarely found in movies currently being made. The lesson of believing in yourself, and overcoming struggles is important for kids to learn. It teaches one about the ability to trust, but also to know that this world is not perfect. The characters will leave your stomach hurting from the laughter produced, and the songs will have you singing. The animation is nothing to be overlooked, and its rather perfect nature will leave you in awe. There is no contest that this movie will forever remain a classic. A competitor for its place in the homes of America is almost impossible to find.	10
 Tremendously Moving Film.		10
 An absolute classic		10
 The Greatest Disney Classic ever	No other Disney movie will get the appreciation I give to this marvelous work of art. In the future, this will be a movie I will treasure with my kids. Unlike other Disney classics, The Lion King is the one that will stay with me until the time I die. I watch the film to this very day, and it gives me goose bumps to remember the film that I treasured in my childhood. The landscapes are very well made, the voices are so good, the music is very fascinating, especially the background music. The plot is simple yet awesome and made in such a great way. I introduced this film to my little cousins and they loved it. Lion King is a true work of art that should never be spoiled. I also still play the Lion King Super Nintendo video-game, which I also had in my childhood. Definitely this film will be adored in many generations, and I'm sure I will enjoy it when I'm older. Its worth watching more that 1,000 times.	10
 A movie I've loved since I could tie my shoes.	"First off, I have to admit that this review will most likely be peppered with sentiment and generational bias, as this was the very first film I was ever exposed to. I was a total child of the '90s (indeed, sometimes I still say ""NOT!"" at the end of a sentence not (pun intended, sorry)), and one of the fondest memories I have from that period in my life was when my dad took my brother and sister and I to see The Lion King on the big screen in 1994, when I was only six years old. Although my memories of that experience are obviously now only very feint (about the only parts of the film I can recall from that screening are the Hakuna Matata scene and the stampede), The Lion King is a movie that has practically become part of my life.Influenced heavily by Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King follows the adventures of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a lion cub and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion), a curious and mischievous lion cub who ""just can't wait to be king."" Framed for the murder of his father Mufasa (the commanding voice of James Earl Jones) and exiled from the Pride Lands by his jealous and power-mad uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons, voicing the kids' movie villain that has plagued the nightmares of more children than any other since the Wicked Witch of the West), Simba escapes to a rainforest paradise inhabited by Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane, pricelessly hilarious) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). However, destiny calls thanks in part to a reunion with childhood best friend Nala (voiced by Niketa Calame as a cub and Moira Kelly as a lioness), and Simba gallantly returns to the Pride Lands to at last confront his sins and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands.The Lion King is, without serious rivals, my absolute favourite animated film of all. And the reasons why? Firstly, the afore-mentioned nostalgic significance. But it goes much deeper than that. When I was a boy, I was completely oblivious to all the actual themes in the film, such as courage, loyalty, redemption and facing one's sins (although over the years it did teach me to learn from my mistakes). Now, as a far more experienced and worldly 20-year-old, I can watch The Lion King back and  with now recognizing and understanding those themes, and seeing how ambiguously and intricately they're woven into the plot, so they're not shoved down the viewer's throat  I now know and appreciate what a rare film The Lion King really is.On top of that, the traditional animation holds up very well against the now-dominant form that is computer animation, the screenplay by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton is resplendent with by turns exuberance, humour, emotion and timeless and universal themes of the heart, and the soundtrack  powered by those amazing Elton John/Tim Rice standards ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Circle of Life"" and Hans Zimmer's mouth-watering score  is second to none. Don't get me wrong, most other works in the Disney cannon are great, but this one will forever the jewel in the crown in my eyes. And I still have the VHS tape. And cry when Mufasa dies. And know all the words to every song.Thanks for the memories, Rob, Roger and co. The Lion King is one that movie that I'll certainly be introducing my kids to someday."	10
 The True Mane Event! The Best!	The Lion King is easily Disney's most successful and entertaining film ever! Every character is unique in their own way. The Music is not of this world. Circle of Life is the song I want on my funeral. (Listen to the lyrics and you'll see why) Each song is so reminiscent towards my long lost childhood. For some reason, I Just Can't Wait To Be King excels most on that. Hans Zimmer score is the greatest I've heard in my life. Thank God he took the Oscar home! This film is most tragic to me, and uplifting at the same time. It's sad that Disney will never ever make a film just like this again. But hey, they couldn't even if they tried! So from the story, to the voice acting, animation, music, and so on, this is the GREATEST film ever!	10
 My Favorite Film Period!		10
 The Best Disney Movie EVER	Out of all the Disney movies I've seen, The Lion King is one of the most remarkable films of all time. The story was touching, the characters were unbelievable, and the music was beautiful.The actors were chosen rightly for their characters & their personalities. Though the movie is rated G, some of the scenes my be too intense & disturbing for younger children. In this meaning, it is an outstanding movie, but in my opinion should be rated PG due to the fighting scenes and darkness of some death scenes. However, it's a great movie to share with the whole family. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed! It's a classic for years & years to come.	10
 Amazing Movie for all Ages!	"You truly have not seen an animated movie until you have seen ""The Lion King"". It is witty, exquisitely animated, and charming. The plot line is original and although I am well aware that it was copied from ""Hamlet"", as far as animated movies go, it was daring. Little Simba is absolutely the cutest animal ever, except for possibly Dumbo... While all of these factors have made it one of my favorite movies, there is one more that definitely separates it from all the other Disney movies, and that is the voice talent. James Earl Jones is wonderful as Mufasa as well as Jeremy Irons as the devious Scar. The bottom line is that you must watch this movie because it has a great message for younger kids, as well as a few jokes that children won't understand, for adults."	10
 Best Animated film I have ever seen		10
 The epitome of a masterpiece.	I am one of those teenagers who grew up in the time of Lion King, and back then I totally enjoyed it. But, having just seen it recently, I feel as if I must write this review. While not considering myself a movie buff, I have seen plenty of movies on AFI's top 250. However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King.	10
 Not just some love story		10
 great film!	The Lion King is a great film. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more. The message is very positive. There is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot. Previous films were routine love stories where boy and girl meet, know each other, fall in love and stay together in the very end. This film is much more than that. Simba is a young prince and his father is the King, who is respected and loved by all. The prince is next in line to the throne. He is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, king's evil extremely jealous brother, wants to be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants. Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, he falls in love with her and Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, romance, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie.	10
 Fantastic, definitely one of Disney's best!		
 Lovely lovely movie		10
 Best Disney movie by far!		10
 A true original Disney classic!	I remember watching this movie when it first came out on video as a little kid. Now I'm grown up and much older, but my feelings about this movie remain the same. It's terrific. One of the first movies I really came to love. Little kids and parents will both enjoy this classic kid's movie from Disney, despite being an older movie.It's easy to understand The Lion King's success if you look at the cast. It's got Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, etc. These are great actors, and they do all of their parts well. The comedy was pulled of well, the dramatic scenes were awesome, and the songs are just plain wonderful. I honestly wish Disney made more stuff like this, since I feel some of their recent stuff is horrible. This movie had the plot, scenery, and dialog of a truly great kid's movie.The story is that Simba is a young prince, son of king Mufasa, and heir to the pride-lands. The pride-lands are the beautiful plains where many peaceful animals live. Scar, Mefusa's brother, is outraged that Simba is before him in line for the throne. Scar's corrupt soul only desires to be ruler, so he plots with the outcast hyenas of the out-lands to kill Mefusa and Simba. During the scheme, Mefusa dies while Simba escapes. Simba, however, thinks he's responsible for his father's death because of a chat with Scar. Scar becomes ruler, and his hyena henchmen take over the pride-lands and devour everything.Meanwhile, Simba is rescued and befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who live carefree lives in a beautiful land away from the pride-lands. Simba learns to live without responsibilities or worries, and puts his past behind him. Then he runs into his old best friend, Nala. Nala tells Simba of what has happened to his homelands, and with some counseling from a baboon named Rafiki, Simba returns home. Accompanied by Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, and even Rafiki, Simba fights scar and takes his place as king.I still have my original VHS copy of this movie, and I still watch it to this day. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie. This movie is one of the best of all time. Get a copy if you can. You will not be disappointed.	10
 The best Disney movie of my life...no one movie can top this...	"When i was 4 or 5 and the movie came out, i watched the movie everyday and i enjoyed it...Thing is, I'm deaf soi never understood the movie but i love ""seeing"" it and i keep thinking about it all the time and now I'm age 18... Last time i saw this probably 6 or 7 years ago so now the last 3 days, 13 years later...I finally saw it in DVD and i fully understand it and it makes it even more wonderful and extraordinary!! I swear, nothing can top this movie...I hope not...This is THE movie. It's a good-feeling/ emotionally feeling movie.Definitely 10 out of 10"	10
 One of the greatest films ever made.....		10
 Still love it after 12 years		8
 Long live the King	This movie often reminds me of my childhood. The old times, then everything around was new and unfamiliar. And now I clearly remember, how I first saw it on VHS and was really impressed with whole magic Disney had created. Even today I think very well of this movie and recommend it to my friends, no matter how old they are. Few days ago I watched this movie again with my friends, although it was digitally remastered. Sure thing I wanted to see the classic version but nevertheless I enjoyed it very much. And so did my friends, They also agreed with me, what nowadays movies can't compare with old Disney's classics and I hope, that people won't forget them. It would be a great fun if all these characters as Simba from my long beloved Liong Kinng or Little Marmaid Ariel once again would be popular and famous as they were long ago.	10
 The Greatest Animated Film I Have Ever Seen	In 1989 Disney released The Little Mermaid and reinvented it's animation department. The peak of that reinvention seemed to end with Aladdin. But then in 1994 they released the highest grossing and most commercially successful animated film of that time. I have seen Beauty And The Beast, Aladdin, and Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. This one leaves them all in the dust. I first saw it in theaters at the age of six. My uncle whom I was extremely close to died a couple months before the movie came out. I had to be taken out of the theater. It took me six years before I was able to watch it without breaking down at Mufasa's death scene. Now I simply break down and cry throughout the rest of the movie. The film is incredibly deep, has an all star voice cast, and blends splendid animation with Oscar winning songs and compulsive storyline. You can't help but enjoy it.	
 The best	This is the best Disney animated movie ever!  I first saw this movie in the theatre when it came out and it has became one of my favorite movies.  I am 27 years old and I can still watch this movie over and over again.  I have a 4 year old daughter that loves this movie as well, but she will not watch it with me anymore because I know this movie word for word.  I was very excited to show her this movie and hopefully she will pass it on to her children. This is a movie that I hope will be passed on from generation to generation. The characters were great as well as the voices behind them.  Whoopie Golderg and Cheech Marin brought the hyenas to life as well as Jonathon Taylor  Thomas and  the rest of the voices.  I can't wait to share this movie with mu son when he gets old of to watch it. (he his 6 months old)	
 Disney's The Lion King took the country by storm.		9
 This is my sister's favourite film, and one of mine!		10
 Very overrated		3
 Overrated pap	"A little balance, I hope, to offset the rants of some of the single-star-ers: after years of having ""The Lion King"" simmering in the background of my film-going conscience, we finally bought it for the kids for Christmas and watched it tonight for the first and, at least for me, last time.The Simba/Kimba thing has been mentioned here enough, so I'm going to focus on this from a story-and-character point of view.  half-hearted (read: rather pathetic) attempt at explaining away the ""we eat animals but when we die we become grass so what goes around etc."" concept (or restated, the prey animals know their place in the big picture and consent to being eaten  nice if you're the lion), but let's not get too deep into the mythologies this film supports (patriarchy-as-common-sense, benevolent dictators, ma-'n'-pa family model as the ideal, Africa as one big national park)  poor character development. Simba is just shallow and his change of heart towards the end is cheesy.  by comparison with films like ""Toy Story"" or even the ""Ice Age"" franchise, the writers simply seemed to lack imagination. Perhaps they cancelled each other out, considering that this was definitely not the brainchild of a single writer whatever, the result is pretty watery  Scar is barely scary, nor is his scar ever explained. He comes off as being effete and lazy and conniving, which is fine, but like all the other characters here he's completely two-dimensional from start to finish. A mediocre villain at best.  A lot of the Americanisms in the dialogue left me cold: this was clearly pitched at a Disney-loving US-English audience  Mostly cheesy humor. Second time I've used cheesy here, must mean something. Lots of mediocre puns, a few good ones. And somehow, references in films like this to classic lines from far more adult and accomplished films like ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Taxi Driver"" (both get a nod from Pumbaa in his ""Are you talking to *me*? -- THEY CALL ME MR. PIG!"" sequence) come off as cheap and Disney-American in the worst sense. Some brightish moments when Fuzu is the unwilling object of a ""pounce"" lesson and the look on Nala's face after her dip in the pond, some decent character voice work from Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons despite the lines they were given.  Characters appear at opportune moments with no sense of them being there for any other reason than an easy out on the writers' part: Musafa rescuing Simba from the hyenas, e.g. or Simba rescuing Timon and Pumbaa from Nala.  The orchestral music is overblown, the songs largely forgettable. Strange, considering the involvement of Tim Rice. I'll leave Elton out of this: apart from ""Tommy"" I was never a fan. Although Timon's anti-romance intro to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" is pretty good (just the intro, though).  Just why the heck did the river run dry just because Scar took over the pride?  For a ""family film"" this is pretty high on the violence scale, not least the slow motion and totally uninspired slugfest between Simba and Scar.  Enormous plot holes and missing info: Did Simba really get that big and strong on bugs alone? Why did Scar have so much access to little Simba when Mustafa obviously mistrusted his brother? Where was Simba's mum all this time? Just how did Simba pull himself back onto that rock at the end when Scar had him dead to rights? Etcetera.  Some egregious examples of explaining away plot points in the dialogue, especially how Nala just happens to stumble across Simba again.  Cloying and sentimental far too much of the time.Okay, that's my two cents for now. I could go on, but would it be worth the effort? The best I can hope for is to persuade a couple of potential viewers to make better use of their time than with soft-boiled tripe like this."	3
 Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims		7
 Exciting original story from Disney.		8
 A masterpiece	U can't get your eyes of the screen.. Hugely entertaining	10
 The best disney movie ever!!!	This is the most entertaining disney movie ever made. The characters the songs, the amazing colours, everything!!! The remake was only good for one thing and that's to prove how good the original is. Long live The Lion King (1994).	10
 The king of all animated films.		9
 What Animation should Strive to be	I loved this movie as a kid. I watched it plenty of times, and enjoyed it every single one of those. Now, over time, a lot of entertainment aimed at kids loses some of it's value. In many cases, it can ruin the experience if you go back and re-watch it as an adult.The Lion King is not like those. The Lion King is just as good as when I was a kid, and that's not just with nostalgia glasses on. Sure, the story's been done before, and it does share some striking similarities to a much older anime, but it still holds my attention and provides great character moments. This movie, if released for the first time today as is, would likely still be one of the best movies of all time.	10
 Great childhood movie	Keep this movie in the family! Great story and there's never a dull moment.	10
 Amazing Film	This beautiful film never gets old. I enjoyed it as a kid and enjoyed it better as an adult now. It is great for the whole family	10
 Must watch	Ageless movie, just awesome.Even when Disney creats most of their movies based on the same line, i think this one is just one of a kind	10
 The past can hurt... But the way I see it - you can either learn from it or run from it	"The animated movie of a childhood with simple yet philosophical texts. Simba has to decide his and his pride's fate. Young king has to discover himself and take place in ""a circle of life""."	10
 This movie is Power!	"I just hear ""The Lion King"" and I shudder! Amazing and one of the best movies ever made, a classic who will be remembered for eons."	10
 A classic	All Disney movies are good, except for maybe Princess and the Frog. This movie was released during, I would say, Disney's golden age of movies when Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Pocahontas were made. While Mickey Mouse will always be Disney's flagship character, the princesses from these movies laid the ground work for what we know Disneyland to be today. I believe that the animals in the movies also offer a certain mysticism that contributes to the magic of what Disney and Disneyland is today. And like many other cartoon Disney movies, Lion King is a classic because of the plot, songs, and the art work. I would definitely recommend any child to see Lion King because it is always fun seeing a movie and then visiting the theme park where all your favorite characters live.	10
 A fulfilled childhood	The best Disney movie ever! This movie is a must watch if you are a fan of Disney movie, if you are old, if you are young... it's an everlasting movie for the future generations! I personally have watched it more than i can remember!	10
 A childhood to remember	This is the most iconic Disney movie ever! This movie is a must watch	10
 Fav	This has always been a favorite of mine. Definitely not disappointed.	10
 The best animated movie of the 1990s	This was a fantastic film and it was beautifully made. This is an animated movie in which everyone will love including the critics and Audience. The movie had a beautiful story and it also had wonderful music and animation. It's starts off with a young cub who lives in a kingdom place until his evil uncle kills his father and he is banished. Then he grows into an adult, he comes back and defeats his uncle and becomes the king. The movie is very sad also. But the movie has a very great ending. My favorite character of the movie is Simba. The ending is wonderful. The actors did a great job. The lion king is a masterpiece and this is my 5th favourite animated movie of all time	9
 long last....	I used to watch this movie with my parents and today I am Mom and still watching it with my baby girl.......still priceless.	10
 A very good Disney animated movie.	The Lion King was one of the best Disney musicals of all time. Despite it's G rating, this film deals with very mature issues such as social unrest, terrorism, murder, and anarchism, and they should have added a PG-13 rating. The story was about a young cub named Simba who wanted to be king, but after his father was brutally killed in the stampede by his vengeful uncle Scar, he runs away from homeland. The songs in the film were fantastic, but the scenes are very intense, violent, brutal, and bleak. I highly recommended all viewers ages 11 and up.	10
 I love this movie.	Best movie ever. Everybody's favorite movie. 1st movie that made me cry. I know every song to this movie. My favorite song is HAKUNA MATATA. When I have kids I will make sure they know all the songs as well. I always wanted to be a dancer in the LION KING musical. I will try for the next audition. This movie is a must see, mandatory must see movie.	10
 Brilliant	One word describes this movie, BRILLIANT!!! From beginning to end, the hairs on the back of my neck couldn't stop standing. The story line was simple yet captivating, the acting was bang on and flawless. The delivery of the movie was done with such ease and humor. I have seen the movie over and over since it come out.	10
 Great Storytelling	Awesome! Awesome!! Awesome!!! One word describes this movie, again AWESOME!!! From beginning to end, the story line is simple yet captivating, the acting and expressions were bang on and flawless. The delivery of the movie was done with such ease and humor. There's nothing more to say than that! It employs beautiful shots and creative lighting techniques as well.	10
 .	I've probably watched this movie 100 times as a kid.It's my favorite movie of all time. Everyone should watch this movie.Truly a classic.	10
 The Lion King 10/10	"This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I will love this movie my whole life. The King among Disney Cartoons for me. This is possibly the last great hand drawn Disney movie. It doesn't matter what kind of films you like you'll love The Lion King. This movie NEVER fails to make me smile, to make me laugh, to make me smile. Beautiful Animation, excellent voice cast, brilliant story.The Lion King is probably still my favorite Disney movie. It is just epic. Once watch it you will never forget it. Brilliant!No matter what I try and say here it will all end the same way. ""The Lion King"" is the most beautiful and epic film Disney have ever made. Once seeing this film one sees the power that this genre can exude."	10
 An African anthropomorphic animated epic from Disney now celebrates it's 20th anniversary!		10
 This is one of the best movies ever	I could watch this movie over and over and it never get old. If you haven't seen this yet, you got go see it. Im not one of those people that really like musical movies but the songs in this movie were the best. I would sing along with them and I'm 17 now and you might still catch me singing some of them. The way how Simba comes back and take over what is really is and take the name of king will really touch you. This shows that you could take control or scare someone when there young but one day they have to grow up and become a man. This movie is a good movie for the whole family to watch and everyone in the family will be into to it. from the youngest in the family to the oldest.	10
 A real Disney beauty		10
 Stands Tall Among Disney's Classics	"The Lion King is an animated musical-adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of anthropomorphic lions in Africa, and was influenced by the Bible tales of Joseph and Moses, and the William Shakespeare play Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. It was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. The voice cast includes Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. It tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to take his father Mufasa's place as king. However, after Simba's uncle Scar kills Mufasa, he must stop his uncle from conquering the Pride Lands and avenge his father.One of the most popular Disney animated musicals, it presents the story of a lion cub's journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny.Simba begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful King Mufasa. The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, Scar ,murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog and Timon the meerkat, he and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne.Borrowing elements from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer. Embraced by children and adults alike, the film also spawned hit songs (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight,"" ""The Circle of Life"") and a hit Broadway musical.Everyone, young and old, will find something to appreciate in this tale of a young lion discovering his rightful place in the world.Emotionally stirring, richly drawn, and beautifully animated, The Lion King stands tall within Disney's pantheon of classic family films."	10
 Disney's Pride		8
 A Terrific Adventure for all Ages,		9
 An Animated Masterpiece,	"""The Lion King"" is essentially a retelling of ""Hamlet"" set on the Savannah and casted with lions. Simba (Prince Hamlet) is the child of Mufasa (King Hamlet) and Sarabi (Gertrude), the heir apparent of the Savannah. His uncle Scar (Claudius), however, has ambitions for the throne. Aligning himself with a pack of hyenas, Scar succeeds in killing his brother and taking the throne for himself. The Hyenas, unable to kill Simba, chase him into a desert and leave him for dead. He grows up mentored by the meerkat Timon (Rosencrantz) and the warthog Pumba (Guildenstern) until Nala (Ophelia), a childhood friend, finds him and convinces him to return home and take his place as king.Despite abundant opportunities to become a derivative child-friendly adaptation of the Shakespeare play, ""The Lion King"" succeeds as a unique and family-friendly experience. It conveys the emotions of tragic loss and unforgivable betrayal that, while devastating and heartbreaking, are still appropriate for the entire family. Even moreso than Bambi's mother's, Mufasa's death is a heartrenching experience (and I am not above admitting that I cried watching Simba search for his father in the deserted gorge in which he died).The animation is easily the most breathtaking of Disney's 2-D features: brilliantly capturing the majesty of the African Savannah. The Pride Lands are bright and crisp while the elephant graveyard is nightmarishly grim. The landscape upon Simba's return is nothing short of haunting.The film demonstrates an elegant mastery of visual symbolism rare in films produced since the early sixties. The song ""Be Prepared"" contains evocative visual allusions to the Third Reich, aligning Scar's reign with that of Hitler's. Gothic tradition holds that the natural world is a reflection of the social order; as such, the barren Pride Lands, littered with bones and scorched flora, with bent, stunted trees in the foreground reflects the unnatural ascension of Scar to the throne. In a moment of catharsis etched into every child's memory, the post-battle rain washes away the last remnants of Scar's reign, cleansing the Pride Lands and its inhabitants.A host of prominent actors lend their vocal talents to this film, including the James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg. Elton John rounds out the vocal ensemble, lending his voice to a number of Tim Rice's exceptional musical numbers.This is film is a true classic and easy to for all viewers, young and old, to enjoy together. It is a rare person who will not find something to like in it (genuinely funny quips, thrilling musical numbers, well-crafted script, exceptional voice talents). If you get the slightest opportunity to see this film, I recommend that you take it."	9
 I've cried so many times while watching this film...		10
 The Last Great Hand-Drawn Animated Film from Disney		9
 Not enough words to describe how great this movie is.	"This is Disney's last masterpiece, and probably, the best animated feature from the past decade. The movie has it all: an excellent plot, perfect character description, amazing musical numbers, and excellent animations.The similarities between ""The Lion King"" and ""Hamlet"" are obvious but I must say that very different at the same time. ""Hamlet"" is a tale of ambition, lust, power, betrayal while ""The Lion King"" treats the same situations but such in a magical way that you can't help but adore.When I first watched this movie in theaters, I felt powerful. The events are dedicated 100% for children but adults can enjoy them too. To this day, I watch when possible this movie and it always makes me feel very good. This is in my opinion the best Disney movie you can find. Please, watch it because you will have a great, great time."	10
 Wonderful Music and Rhythms		9
 An impressive animated movie.		9
 Instant Disney Classic	"Gods I love this movie!The soundtrack is exemplary as is every element of this beautiful Disney masterpiece.The Baboon, affectionately dubbed ""Bruce-Monkey"" after Bruce Lee, is a scream! Jeremy Irons' voice as Scar is absolutely Shakesperean in its darkling malevolence. James Earl Jones's voice is a perfect Mufassa; it's commanding and brooding, just as it should be, turning playful when the mood arises. The graphics and artistry are some of the best ever produced by Disney, in this Fiend's opinion, and the eclectic spirituality of the movie; the circle of life, the wheel of the year, birth and rebirth, are moving and inspiring.As with all Disney movies, the movie has a message: make responsible choices and be responsible for the choices you make.I highly recommend the 2-disk Special Edition with added footage and an entire disk of extras.It gets a solid 9/10 from...the Fiend :."	9
 The Greatest Disney Film Of All Time.		
 One of Disney's greatest movies		10
 Walt Disney's 32nd animated feature film about Simba, a future lion king who must fight his evil Uncle for the throne.	"I wish Walt Disney was alive to see this, he would of loved it! This is probably the ultimate Disney movie. What makes the Disney movies so great are how they take themselves so seriously despite being a kids cartoon. I don't care how old you are but you're be lying if you said this movie didn't move you. This movie is similar to Disney's 2nd greatest film, Bambi. They both begin with the birth of an animal who is destined to be king of his domain, they both lose one of their parents, and the story ends with them both taking their place as king. The film's also a lot like Shakesphere's Hamlet, a story about a man who kills his own brother so he can be king. In fact, this is the first original Disney story and what a great story it is. In Disney's tradition the animation is fantastic and realistic looking. The African landscape looks awesome and very detailed. I love the idea of a lion king, because we are know lions are the king of the jungle. So take a lion king, Bambi, hamlet, and you got your self a good story. But every story needs good characters and in the tradition of classic Disney movies this has a lot of good characters. I love James Earl Jones as Moffassa, his voice is perfect for the role. He sounds authoritative and loving. Simba, the star of the story, is likable and sympathetic. You feel for him and root for him. You can't help but to love Timon & Pumba and they provide good comic relief. The hyenas are likable, even though their bad. But Shenzi, Bonzi and ED are not as evil as Scar, but are mostly indifferent, they only care about their own self interest. I wish they would've done a spin-off with the hyenas like they did with Timon & Pumba. Then there's Scar, who has to be the most evil villain in any Disney movie. I also think he is an underrated villain, I mean I never see his name on any ""greatest villain list"", he's one of the best villains ever! He killed his own brother, tried to kill his nephew, made his nephew think that he killed his father, and lied to everyone in pride rock! In fact, he might be too dark for little kids. The music is great, and I know sometime it's hard to sit through musicals, but the songs fit well into the story. And how can you not love the ""Akuta Motta"" song! That song's my philosophy too, I believe in ""No worries for the rest of your days!"" But the best song, hands down is ""circle of life"". Written by Elton John and sung by Carmen Twillie. If the movie dosen't move you, the song will. In fact, that's what makes this movie really epic, is the underlying theme about the circle of life and I like how the movie came full circle at the end of the story, ending how the film began! The lyrics are great! ""It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, through faith and hope, through despair and love, until we find our way on the path unwinding, in the circle of life!"" This film has the best opening of any movie, it's truly epic. The only problem I have with this movie, is how the story gets a little convoluted towards the end, but that's because they had a lot of story they were trying to wrap up. And I also think it's funny how were in Africa but Simba sounds American, Scar sounds English and Rafiki sounds Jamecain, or how that Buffalo stamp peed went on forever. The directors Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job, on this timeless classic!"	10
 The One True King of animated films!	"This is my all-time favorite movie! This movie has been a part of my life since I was an infant. I am now 18, which has given me plenty of time to ponder why this film has been and continues to be a huge success. I think it's so popular for one reason: It appeals to both young and old film viewers, and here's why.First, for kids, it has great music, it's funny, and has great characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast, which are qualities that make a great animated film. It's easy for an animated film to entertain children, but it's really something when adults are touched by it as well. I think one of the reasons adults like this movie so much is that it does not act like a children's film. It acts like a drama made for adults. The plot is fairly simple, but its themes, emotion, and the psychology of the characters within are things that only mature audiences will truly understand. The plot is basically about a young cub, named Simba. He loves his father, Mufasa, is eager to become king one day, and is fascinated by all he sees and hears. His life takes a very bad turn when his uncle, Scar, kills his father in order to gain the throne. He sends the cub into exile. Simba meets some new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, who raise him with a no worries lifestyle until his best friend from home, Nala, and a wise baboon, Rafiki, encourage him to return home and claim his rightful place as king. As I said, this plot is very basic. However, what is not so basic is the feelings of guilt that Simba feels for the death of his father and the psychological trauma that he has to endure for the rest of the film. Again, what is not so simple is the themes. Simba's father appears to him in the clouds and tells him ""Remember who you are."" This message basically states that a person cannot shirk their responsibilities, a message that a toddler cannot begin to understand. In addition to that, the film sums up what life is all about: Going through hard times, dealing with it, and coming out stronger because you endured it. I think the adults that watch this film grasp that concept and appreciate it. My own grandmother, who's in her eighties, bought her own copy of this film!In addition to these things, the film has other elements that cannot be ignored. The first is definitely the wonderful music and songs. Hans Zimmer made the score for this film and won a much deserved Oscar for it. Elton John and Tim Rice also won Oscars for their brilliant work on this film. The songs that they created, like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, are so well written that you can't help but be touched by them. The African words sung by Lebo M. contribute highly to the majesty of the film. When Lebo's team first sings, you automatically know that you're in Africa. From his birth to his ascension as king, Simba's journey is wondrously captured through the music and songs that the film provides. Another thing that makes this film so wonderful is the animation. Every single tree, animal, and background that appears on the screen is a stunning work of art. People that do not like this movie will usually admit that the animation is absolutely stunning. It has to be wonderful when the animators actually went to Africa and brought lions into their studio! While all of the other things about this film are wonderful, my personal favorite is the villain, Scar. He is so wonderfully voiced, animated, and brought to life that you love him, hate him, and may even be scared by him all at once. Jeremy Irons, Andreas Deja, and everyone else who worked on this character created one of the best villains in film history. He is the only animated villain to be nominated for an MTV best villain award, and is widely considered to be one of the best Disney villains of all time. Scar is so magnificent that he is in the same category with Hannibal Lecter and Ledger's Joker. The Lion King has many wonderful things that make it spectacular, but, for me, it would not be the same without Scar. A very close second to Scar is Mufasa. He is so incredibly voiced that I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. James Earl Jones brings the qualities of a commanding leader and a wonderful, loving father at the same time to this character that you can't help but feel sad when he is killed. These two characters alone make the film worth seeing. Add everything else that is great about it, and you have one of the best films ever made.The Lion King has been entertaining audiences for 17 years and will do so for many years more. With its great vocal talent, animation, songs, music, and themes, the Lion King has earned its spot in IMDb's top 250 films ever made. I do not thing it will be leaving the list any time soon. It's a real shame that it was not nominated for best picture. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wishes to see a children's film that goes beyond the typical feel good animated film. With the possible exception of Beauty and the Beast, this is definitely the King of all animated films! If you haven't seen it, in 2D or 3D, I strongly encourage you to do so. You won't regret it!"	10
 Disney At Its Finest	"They're re-releasing Lion King in 3D for the next two weeks, so I thought it would be a good time to look back on one of Disney's most popular films. All I can say is after watching this movie countless of times as a kid it still holds up today.The story is about a young lion cub named Simba who is next in line to be the king of the jungle. Simba is rather mischievous and gets into trouble a lot with his friend Nala. His uncle Scar is jealous of Simba because he gets to be the king, so he hatches a plan with his Hyena goons to kill Simba and King Mufasa. They succeed in killing Mufasa but Simba escapes and blames himself for Mufasa's death. He goes into exile and meets two jungle bums Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the Hakuna Matata(no worries) life style and Simba grows up without a care in the world. But the lions in Pride Rock don't have it so good. Scar has let everything go to ruin and is too stubborn to leave to go look for food and water. Nala leaves to find help and finds Simba. She tries to convince him to come home but he still blames himself for Mufasa's death(not knowing it was Scar who killed him to begin with). Simba must now make a decision to either run from his past or challenge Scar to become the next king.I haven't really done the plot justice by paraphrasing it but I'm sure a good many people are already quite familiar with this movie. Everything in it is top notch. The animation, the all-star cast of characters, the epic score by Hans Zimmer and the catchy tunes from Elton John and Tim Rice. Much like the old Disney movies this movie isn't afraid to get dark. There's numerous assassination attempts(one that succeeds), dark themes you wouldn't find in most kid's films nowadays, and a few jokes aimed towards the older audience. What is not to love about this movie? The only bad thing I can think about this film doesn't come from the original edit. It's the song ""Morning Report"" that comes from the special edition released a few years back. The song worked well for the Broadway show but in the movie it just slows things down and seems unnecessary next to the other songs. But still it doesn't change my opinion of the actual movie. I am going to see it in 3D? Probably. But even if the 3D turns out bad it'll be nice to see what it might have been like to watch it on the big screen."	10
 A timeless masterpiece	"I remember seeing it when I was a kid and I loved it. Then I saw it again as an adult, and I absolutely loved it: This have to be one of the best animated movies ever made. The drawings are beautiful and full with details, the songs are catchy, the characters were very likable, and the story is memorable, filled with funny and powerful moments.""The Lion King"" was one of the best movies released by Disney and it was easily one of the best movies ever made. It wasn't until the last year, when Disney released ""The Princess and the Frog"" that any animated film from Disney reached this level of quality. ""The Lion King"" it's a timeless animation made for people of all ages. It is hard to believe that the director of this wonderful movie, Roger Allers it's also the director of that awful ""Open Season"" film."	10
 Favorite Disney Film of all time	Lion King 10/10Lion King is a popular choice of being on people's favorite Disney movie list. There is really not any flaws in this type of film. It has a good story and not looking for cheap jokes that i find in CGI animal films. The music is amazing and really helps tell the story. The emotions you feel watching this film is overwhelming. It is a good feel movie because even though there is betrayal and death in the film life continues.Least favorite parts: Hard to pick anything that I dislike in this film, but I guess Simba having to think it was his fault for his father's death all those years sucked. lolFavorite parts: Music Recommendation: Movie that should be own. A movie to revisit in about lets say at least once in two years.	10
 An Instant Classic!	"The Lion King is the movie that will be honored fro the next thousand years. It's really that good! The movie starts with young Simba being shown to the rest of the world by this old monkey. As the movies goes on, King Mufasa is murdered by his own brother Scar. Scar also banishes Simba from the kingdom. In exile, Simba meets a warthog and a meercat. When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG. Overall, an excellent family classic! I rate this movie 10/10."	10
 the best Disney film ever	The lion king has to be the best Disney movie ever.its loved by millions of people all round the world.every year i watch at least 3 times and a outstanding Disney classic and the lion king is one of those films that will never die out.the story is simple but really effective.it has funny parts,sad and romance,what more do you want!if you have never watched this film then a strongly urge you to.its a film for the whole family,its not just for children at all even if it was probably aimed for children.the songs are amazing and will be in your head the whole day.the African music builds up a lot of tension in the film which is so affective,you will get into the music and film straight away.10/10.favourite film ever.	10
 Along With Finding Nemo, This is the Best Film Disney's Ever Produced...	"To call this a ""simple kids film"" is to not understand this film at all. Along the lines of Bambi, there's a lot of dark subject matter to be explored (the death of a parent) and even deeper is the use of texts like The Odyssey and Hamlet as seemingly interesting inspirations incorporated into a Disney film with heart, charm, and glorious music.The acting is all well done. Everyone gives it their A-game, especially James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jeremy Irons. Broderick is okay, though cannot deliver his lines without a huge effort on his behalf.The animation is stunning. Such vivid imagery and color is used in the opening shots that it sets the standard for the rest of the picture.Hans Zimmer's score is the second-greatest I've ever heard (next to The Lord of the Rings films, which I count as one film). The sweeping ""king of the past"" theme is gorgeous, and the haunting cues for Scar are terrifying. The musical numbers written by Tim Rice are great, and are sure to be remembered for ages. Elton John's, Can You Feel the Love Tonight? is so grand and beautiful, it was completely deserving of the Best Original Song Academy Award.The story is confined to 90-minutes, though I could've watched twice of that. The film's pace is never dulling, and always inspiring. From the sheer horror Simba faces when seeing his dead father, to the simply masterpiece of a scene where the rains wash away Scar's destroying of Pride Rock, and Simba's ascension as king... just beautiful.Overall, right alongside Finding Nemo, The Lion King is the best film Disney has ever produced. From its story to it's execution, it is flawlessly excellent. I highly recommend you see this film if you haven't already."	10
 How to describe your childhood in five words or less:	"Walt Disney's ""The Lion King"". This movie remains near and dear to my heart, and not just because I've grown up with it. This Disney film, with it's beautiful backgrounds, amazing voice talents, wonderful music, addicting songs, and touching moments stay with you for your entire life. Lion King remains one of the few movies I tear up at every time, no matter how old I am. Mufasa's death is undoubtedly one of the saddest deaths in movie history, along with the death of Bambi's mother, and Bridge to Terabithia. Watching the movie in class brings out tissues and ""It's my allergy"" excuses all around, as Simba nudges his father's still body, begging him to wake up. Eager lion cubs in an elephant graveyard, goose-stepping hyenas, lovable meerkats doing the hula and a lion cub held up in a ray of sunlight are moments that stay with viewers forever. One of Disney's best, and will remain so forever."	10
 Everything the light touches is our kingdom		10
" ""Hamlet"" it ain't - good Disney, it ain't either, I'm afraid to say"	"For starters, I've been a big Disney and animation fan all my life; seeing Pinocchio at a pretty early age and ""Robin Hood"" on its initial release made huge impacts on me, and by the time this film came out I'd caught up with all of the Disney features. I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from ""Peter Pan"" through ""Oliver and Company"" with a few exceptions. ""The Little Mermaid"" seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked ""Beauty and the Beast"" even more. ""Aladdin"" was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to ""The Lion King"" with even more spectacular results.For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate ""The Lion King"" than if your feelings are negative about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"", or ""2001"". It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from ""Aladdin"" in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the ""good"" characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.But...I still hate the music; ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the ""spectacular"" scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and ""Pocahontas"" in succession."	3
 Hamlet with more Cats	This was my favourite movie for the longest time. The music, the animation, the voice actors, they all did a great job. But looking at it again there are somethings that don't work, such as why did Scar reign cause a drought? But anyway I still found many things that I still enjoyed. The comedy for me works very well, I laugh so hard whenever I see this movie. The songs, although all very catching, listening to them again I found some were annoying and were just alright. But I found that the orchestral score greatly outshines the singing ones. The voice actors, especially James Earl Jones, do a great job and I see them fit into their roles perfectly. The movie also gets some of its story from one of Shakespeare's greatest works, Hamlet. And finally, the animation is spectacular. Every bit looks grand and big. The style looks great. The scenes go from colourful and cheery to dark and violent. The climax, almost similar in power to Bambi, is one of the best in Disney's history, mixing powerful emotions and visuals. All in all, I must say it's still one of my favourite of Disney movies.	9
 Stealer	It's good movie but it's not the original because we live in unfair community	1
 Not feeling the love tonight		4
 Not quite there for me	The Lion King is unquestionably a first rate animated film - my daughter counts it as one of her favourite films of all time (and pinched my copy of the DVD when she left home!). But something about it doesn't quite work for me.The story is excellent, and I love the way that Simba's story is effortlessly tied in to the (non-preachy) circle of life broader picture.The voice talent is all excellent, character design and animation first class, the emotional high (and low) points are all reached as planned.Maybe it's the songs. I like Hans Zimmer's score, but I must confess to not liking all of Elton John's songs (particularly The Circle Of Life itself).And maybe it's just because I am becoming a grumpy old curmudgeon. Because, without any doubt, it is an absolute classic children's film.Edited 10 October 2011 after seeing 3D version at the cinema.Am I correct that this reworking is the first full-length 3D film using traditional drawn animation? Whether it is or not, it is a terrific conversion: it adds an element of visual majesty to a film which is already very good.	8
 The Beginning of the End		3
 This movie really is rubbish	"I apologise to all those captivated by the African landscapes and orchestral harmonies, but this movie is disjointed and shallow. The mass of names credited with the ""Story"" says it all - this movie is a bunch of disconnected scenes thrown together with absolutely no character cohesion at all. Some examples:Simba and Narla bicker and argue. They then sing ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" They then IMMEDIATELY continue to bicker and argue, and part ways.Simba goes from little kid to mature adult - Timon and Pumba do not age a day.After Mufasa safely brings himself and Simba up the cliff, he is then thrown to his death, and Simba never sees this as unusual or even wonder why.There are absolutely no male lions anywhere in the entire movie other than Mufasa, Scar and Simba - an entire tribe of Lions at pride rock, with no males at all.Timon and Pumba play absolutely no role in the plot, meaning or interest of the movie. They are shallow comic diversions that have no place being there. Their theme song (Hakuna Matata) contradicts the entire message of the movie, which is to live up to your responsibilities instead of ignoring them.Not one lion in Pride Rock EVER wonders what happened to Simba, and nor does the annoying bird Zazu, who was right there when it all happened - this is utterly ridiculous.Scar would never have simply admitted to killing Mufasa.After years of constant threats and derision, Mufasa is surprised when Scar turns against him, as if he never suspected a thing...I could go on for a long time. This movie makes no sense, it is too scary and murderous for young children, and it completely lacks any emotional involvement with any character. The young Simba is utterly arrogant, the old Simba completely distant, and his change of character totally unbelievable and contrived.Yes, this movie ""deals"" with many grand themes - it deals with them in the same way a food processor would ""deal"" with a 3 course meal - mash it all up into random unpalatable rubbish. Yes, the themes are there, but the movie has nothing to say about any of them, and they are presented in a completely disjointed manner. Comparisons to Hamlet is one of the greatest insults possible to Shakespeare.If you want a good kids movie, The Lion King IS NOT IT."	2
 Clichéd story and passive central character make for a weak Disney entry	"Unlike the majority of its Walt Disney brethren, The Lion King was written directly for the screen and does not find its roots in either a fairy tale or popular children's literature. It relates the story of the young lion Simba, who is destined to become king of the pride one day when his regal father Mufasa steps down. This does not sit well with Mufasa's villainous brother Scar, who concocts a scheme to eliminate Mufasa and then convince a guilt-stricken Simba that the death is his own fault and he should exile himself from the pride. Simba befriends the unlikely duo of a meercat and warthog and they become friends during his exile, until his childhood friend Nala arrives to apprise Simba of the ruin that Scar's villainy has left the pride and beg for Simba's return.Although the plot is fairly familiar and clichéd for a new story, there is a lot that could be done here. Unfortunately, Simba is such a passive, uninteresting central character that it is difficult to care much about what happens. Other than Simba, Mufasa and Scar, the pride pretty much blurs together. Simba's mother is a virtual non-entity and Simba's female friend Nala is gone for so much of the running time that you nearly forget she is a character in the film. Other than the comical meercat and warthog team (well voiced by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella), none of the supporting characters are especially memorable, and that duo has little to no impact on the climax. It also does not help that Scar (lazily voiced by Jeremy Irons) is a fairly dull villain. His first act number where he sings about his nefarious plans is disturbing, not only because of Irons horrendous singing, but because someone had the ill-conceived notion of having hordes of his hyena henchmen goose-stepping in the background like Nazi soldiers, which adds a heavy weight that this slight film cannot carry. The film also has a fair amount of dead spots between songs and fight scenes.The animation is typically first-rate, but not as impressive or imaginative as that found in its predecessors, even as recent as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The vocal talent is a mixed bag as well. While Lane and Sabella are stand-outs and James Earl Jones provides the suitably dignified tones for Mufasa, Matthew Broderick is an incredibly bland choice to voice the adult Simba. Ditto, Moira Kelly is not much better as Nala. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin are not particularly menacing as some of the hyenas.Huge gaps in the story seem to smack of really lazy writing. Mufasa is supposed to be an insightful leader, yet is completely blind-sided by the evil plots of his nasty brother, whose perfidy is ridiculously blatant. Once Scar is king and demonstrates that he is terrible, the film would have us believe that not only are there no other male lions to challenge him, but that the lionesses would passively put up with him destroying the pride without any show of resistance. This, of course, sets up the scene for Simba to return as a savior and rescue the pride while facing down Scar, but there are several things wrong. First, the film never convinces us that there is a need for anyone to await Simba's return when the pride could have banded together themselves to challenge Scar and his minions instead of suffering. And second, Simba does nothing during the course of the film to demonstrate that he could be anyone's savior other than that he is Mufasa's son and the plot rather ham-handedly demands it of him.I am also not a fan of the soundtrack written by Elton John. The film opens with the ""The Circle of Life,"" which is a sequence that heralds the birth of Simba, introduces the main characters and sets the stage. Unfortunately, I find this song comes off like one of the worst examples of faux-inspirational Christian rock. ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" sung by the young Simba feels like a third-rate Michael Jackson riff. ""Hakuna Matata"" is probably the best of the songs, but it is surprisingly forgettable. And the less said about the dirge-like love ballad ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the better. It is a horrible song badly shoe-horned into the film. Old childhood friends Simba and Nala rediscover each other and then immediately start fighting, then the film pauses for the love ballad, before they go back to fighting and parting. It is a clumsily staged sequence and one that more often than not has the little ones tuning out. Ironically, the song that sticks with the viewer after the film ends is ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", the old 1950s nutshell which gets a few bars sung in the film and easily outclasses John's pretentious and precious piffles.Purportedly this is Walt Disney's biggest box office success, but it is hard to understand why or how given some of the landmark classics in animation that Disney has provided in the past. I don't find the film fun, or memorable, or particularly astonishing. In fact, barring the dreadful Hercules, I would rank this as one of the worst of the Disney films."	3
 Would you believe its dated!	The Lion King made a big splash when it was released in the mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies. Irons even sings a song or two and has a pretty pleasant voice.	7
 Great	The lion king is a beautiful and hopeful film destined to be a classic Don't be fooled this movie is not only for kids Recommended	7
 Remember what Disney used to be ...	"It's an interesting coincidence that ""The Lion King"" was released one year before the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"": the first animated feature in 3D that would pave the way for a new kind of family entertainment. ""The Lion King"" is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with ""The Little Mermaid"" and brought up memorable masterpieces such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up : masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like ""Mermaid"", the two B's and I'm a big fan of ""Aladdin"", they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about ""The Lion King"" that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic.""The Lion King"" is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what ""Bambi"" was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, ""The Lion King"" works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of ""The Lion King"" with Elton John's ""Circle of Life"" is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element : the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why ""The Lion King"" is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids. In ""The Lion King"", there's no romance, it's not about getting the girl, or the boy, the main character is a kid who wants to become like his father, who learns about the meaning of life, of courage and more than anything, of his identity, something sacred based on two pivotal elements : heritage and family, the past and the future, the very position in the circle of life. We can all relate to Simba as kids and as adults. And generally, the Disney stories that are centered on a kid are more appealing : ""Dumbo"" was about difference's acceptance, ""Pinocchio"" about responsibilities, ""The Fox and the Hound"" about tolerance, ""Jungle Book"" about  not that one was just pure fun  Romances rely on so many elements of predictability it easily undermines their appeal, and to recognize Disney romances, they're generally the ones where you most remember the scene-stealing sidekicks or comic relief characters.In ""The Lion King"", Simba is the heart of the story, and we follow him during an epic journey in life, with his father and mentor, Mufasa, the King with that naturally authoritarian James Earl Jones' voice. Just thinking of the scene where they play at night gives me shudders, and I mean it : any boy close to his father can understand that level of tenderness and love  and of course, it makes the following sequence even more horrific, but this is what makes the film so memorable. Generations of kids have been traumatized by Bambi mom's death, why sparing ours? As usual, in Disney films, death, if not part of life, is part of a learning process, tragic but necessary. This is ""The Lion King"", a wonderful story, populated by a gallery of (literally) colorful characters following an extraordinary soundtrack with so many unforgettable catchy songs, that lurched the film into pop culture memories : ""Hakuna Matata !"" If there was ever a music associated with 1994, it would belong to ""The Lion King"", and I'm glad it won an Oscar for this, as I'm glad Hans Zimmer won for the score too, as it probably is the musical expression of the film's emotional power. The conclusion of the film where Simba gets back on the top of the rock and starts roaring give me thrills (just thinking of it) and never fails to make me cry.There are no words to describe what makes ""The Lion King"" so great. It's like the Disney team decided to combine all the efforts for a last masterpiece ... that would become one of the greatest animated films ever. So great I would have loved that the ghost of Walt Disney would haunt them every once in a while, saying : ""Remember who you are"""	10
 A Disney Masterpiece that is in a class by itself		
 A generation's cult-movie	"Many saw this movie. People of all ages, older and younger, have appreciated it. But a movie is always aiming at a particular target public. The movie was really ""speaking"" to the teenagers, who respond radically to ""the Lion King"" by buying songs and videos, and by singing to the ""pride land's"" rhythms.The movie is truly a masterpiece of animation, though many confirm that the storyline was borrowed from a Japanese anime. It's style is classical and really ""cleancut"". Colors, atmospheres, and musics, all combined to achieve an extraodinary emotional film. One of the best. Only surpassed by Disney's Mulan, which was more complete.A classic! 8* on 10"	8
 I'm in the minority - I didn't like it	'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film.	2
 Probably the Best Disney Movie I've Ever Seen	I have always had a soft spot for this movie. Not only is it the same age as I am, but it boasts one of the best music scores of all Disney movies, (except Tarzan... that one is still one of my absolute favorites) and has some of the best voice work I've seen. Like come on! Darth Vader is voicing Mufasa! (I actually wrote Musafa because I'm writing this drink!)	10
 My best memory	When I was Primary school, watched this movie.Amazing, but... Sadly not so real... Still my one of best memory.	9
 Best animated film ever?	Seeing the 2019 piece of cash grab made me appreciate this one even more. This is one that demands a viewing on a theatre screen. Saw it 4 times in theatres as a kid and it was an experience like no other. Gorgeous animation and visuals, Flawless voice acting, Hans Zimmer's epic score booming through the speakers. It is a work of art. Sadly Disney hasnt really come out with anything remotely close to this since, and probably never will. If this isnt the greatest animated film of all time it is in the top 3 for sure	10
 The Best movie in the World	I was only one years old when The Lion King came out, and it actually scared me. When you are a little kid you just get more scared off the smallest things and when I saw the hyenas chasing Simba in the elephant graveyard I had nightmares for weeks. Granted the Lion king is a pretty violent film for its time and I wouldn't actually recommend you kids watching it at least not without and adult. Now just hear me out, this movie is the reason that I have assembled my love for movies in the first place. It changed everything and guided me into a world off good versus evil and how you always can move away from tragedy in your life and take the path that fate have chosen for you. The Lion King is a movie that will be watched for generations to come and the new remake off the film here in 2019 is not gonna bring the magic back all, I know that because you can't do a movie twice that already have been made so perfectly by Walt Disney himself, its just not gonna happen. I give The Lion king the highest score possible, it truly deserved it.	10
 Best Movie Ever	This is easily the best movie ever. Everything is perfect. I can't believe there are people who don't know this exists. Better than the CGI movie of 2019.	10
 Kimba The Hamlet	I remember watching this as a kid and fairly enjoying it but was surprised to know how much praise it got when I grew up. Even on this rewatch it is pretty good and entertaining. But besides the circle of life concept everything else is quite regressive themes. Add the fact that they never gave credit to Kimba, I think my rating is much higher than it should be.	7
 The golden age of Disney right here	"One of the most beloved animated films The Lion King is a great take on Shakespeare's Hamlet. It must have been clever on the part of the studio heads to use the Shakespearean template and apply it to one of the most beloved of animals- the Lion. The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are very good and the soundtrack, albeit criticized as not being as memorable as other Disney films in some corners usually gets it right. The spectacular ""circle of life"" to open the film should be singled out. This is one of the best films of the Disney Renaissance period."	8
 Disney take on life	I love this movie it is a little dark for young kids because it has a death in the movie but other than that a pretty well made movie for it's time. All the animals are very well acted out.	9
 So good it ruined Disney for me...	After the tears I decided I would never watch it again. 20 years on and promise kept. Wonderful piece of cinema.	9
 I need to be stronger watching this	I cried every time I watch this movies, it's very touching.	10
 Best movie	The best movie of all time in my book...animated or live. I can't wait to see the live version.	10
 A classic, but..	"One can't argue, that ""The Lion King"" is one of those movies people expect you to know when the conversation comes to films. After years of missed chances I finally managed to close this hole. Of course, as far as I can tell, I'm not exactly the peer group for this title, so I won't be judging too hard.The movie tells a nice story. One of those typical stories of good and evil, betrayal and loyalty and the difficulties of finding yourself. Wouldn't it be for the animals, it could as well be some historical drama. Whilest you don't get bored, partly due to the humorous sidekicks, the plot in itself is not really all to innovative.The big strength of the film is in my eyes the soundtrack, that produced quite a few classics that even I could recall. Singing in movies is always a risky thing but in this case reminds me of the old day Disney movies, where singing was almost something like a brand mark.""The Lion King"" is short, but I'm sure children will be able to fall in love with the exceptionally drawn characters quite easily and therefor have their fun. Personally, I didn't quite see why this particular title has so much more credit than many other comparable movies but it entertained me well for an evening."	7
 how does love this film	"It doesn't matter how long you because this movie will melt your heart.This I one on my favourite movies of all time.The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favourite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still can't forget the line he says to Simba, ""The Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it!"" it is so true! I loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, I loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, I found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, it's meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life""."	10
 One of the Masterpiecies of Cinema		10
 An animation masterpiece and a more enduring modern story from the Disney staple		
 Not Quite What I Hoped, But Better Than Most!	It may have been the anticipation that my wife built up in me over the last month waiting for Disney to re-release this movie, but it just wasn't exactly as exciting as I thought it would be. Still giving the movie a 9 rating as it was a good movie; however, there were many parts my 4 year old daughter did not understand. This caused us to pause the movie on numerous occasions in an attempt to explain. This was a great educational experience for her, but took too much discussion and took a little bit away from the flow of the film. On another note, the movie was rather short (88 minutes) which is actually great for an animated movie. Many of the movies today are 120+ and just cannot keep the attention span of a child that long. 88 was great!	8
 The Lion King (1994) - Shakespeare with Jungle Lions! Hakuna Matata, It's Just the Circle of Life! (My 100th Review Ever)		10
 Finally, I got to experience The Lion King where it's meant to be and in 3-D, to boot!	While I had previously seen long segments various times on VHS and theatre showings and was able to piece together the whole story that way, this was the first time I had watched the entire thing in one showing on a big screen and in 3-D, to boot! In short, it was a wonderfully magical time just seeing such a classically made drawn animated movie by the best artists Disney had to offer with great music and songs by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and Tim Rice and perfect voices provided by James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons as the villainous Scar, and especially, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as the great comic relief of Timon and Pumbaa! If there was one slight flaw, it's that how stupid was Scar to reveal his role in killing his brother just as nephew Simba was at death's door. But it did provide Simba to get over himself quickly so maybe that was necessary. Otherwise, The Lion King is one of the greatest experiences I've had at the movies. P.S. If you don't stay for the closing credits and had wondered where the dedication to the late Disney head Frank Wells, previously printed before the film, had gone to-it's now at the very end.	9
" The ""King of the Jungle"""	Everyone recommended it. They told me it was the best Disney movie ever. I had seen almost all the Princess films. I have also seen a few other Disney films. Ever since then, I have seen so many classics.It's hard to explain. On one hand, this film was VERY well done. Good characters, good plot, good story, good effects, good music, no cheesy everyone-goes-into-the-middle-of-the-street-to-dance sequences, etc.On the other hand... I don't know. It seemed to lack something. To be honest, most movies no matter how awesome they are, lack something. I guess near the end when the evil lion was about to be eaten, having the good lion save him even though he did all those bad things, would have been interesting to see. However, it went quite well.But in this case, I'll have to rate it 9/10 because it's a classic! :)	8
 One of Disney's best animated flicks		10
 The king is still roaring loud		10
 The BEST Disney Cartoon ever released	The Lion King is one of the Greatest Cartoon ever released. It has a amazing storyline, with fun characters. The Lion King is a non stop entertainer with a serious storyline. Bambi is regarded one of the serious cartoons. But in my opinion Lion King is 100 times better. It is generally better then the classic cartoons like Aladin, Shrek and Incredibles. Lion King has a Multi starrer cast for the voices of the characters. There are 2 sequels of Lion King. Part Two was quite boring continuing Simba's adventure. Part three was another part one in the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa. They are the funniest characters in this cartoon. This is a MUST SEE, even if you are not fond of cartoons.	10
 This movie was awesome!!!	"I loved this movie it was touching, funny, and great overall. I love Timone, Rafiki, and Pumbaa. They are so funny. The special edition isn't as good as the original but its still good. I've seen this movie a million times and would still see it again. What can I say I love this movie!!!! I especially love the songs like "" I just cant wait to be king "", "" the circle of life "", etc. It's really funny when 2 characters(I wont say who!)do the hula! The lion king has a bunch of funny quotes. I would suggest to anyone to see this movie. It's a great family movie. I hope you like this movie(and this review:) I know I did!!!!"	10
 Hamlet? Sort Of	"Alright, so the comment about Hamlet and The Lion King is more-or-less Accurate. It has many of the same ideas, about the father murdered by his brother, and the son seeking revenge. However, Nala doesn't go insane and die, Simba doesn't go insane, he just goes on a ""simbacation"" and some other things. The main reason that it seems very similar is because both stories are full of Archetypes, which if you don't know what that is, look it up. it's very interesting. It is a great movie and i really don't have a problem with the comparisons to Hamlet. In my AP English class we discussed that very comparison and then discussed why it's not quite the same. Overall, good."	8
 I just want to say that I think it was one of the best movies ever made and I enjoyed it very much.	Every thing about the movie was great. Even the sad parts. It made you laugh, cry, felt happy and sad all in one and don't forget love.	10
 Power, grace and magnificence.	From its stunning sound to the masterful music, The Lion King is an adventure of two forms. First, the story takes you through the trials of Simba, a lion cub trying to find his place in the circle of life. As the viewer grows with Simba, the movie takes a detour to journey to the center of you heart. Through the Lion King, viewers can travel to the depths of their own souls and identify with the struggles of Simba as he tries to find his place in the Circle of Life. Disney's masterpiece has garnered unprecedented support and created a fan base all its own, while establishing itself as one of the defining images of our culture today. Don't miss out! The Lion King is every bit the King of animated features.	10
 THIS is what animation is all about.	Summarize The Lion King... wow. Well, it is by a vast margin the most incredible movie I have ever seen, animated or not. Beautiful animation, astounding special effects and CGI, great songs, and an amazing score by Hanz Zimmer.I just can't say enough about the most amazing movie of all time. A heart-felt thanks goes out to the Walt Disney company for The Lion King.--Paul Summers	10
 One of the best animated movies	The lion king is one of the best if not the best animated movie of all time. Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg are great for the roles they do and this movie should be seen if you haven't yet. Also, great animations are another plus for the movie.85% Very good for an animation film.	8
 MOVIE	Amazing movie and very emaculsnt for children they will eat this movie like dinner	10
 The best animated movie!!!	The movie is wonderful and full of emotion. A visionary triumph filled me with that Disney magic.	10
 omg favourite movie	This is easily the bst lion king of the two its not even a question! smh at the new one which was the same pretty much shot for shot but worst. this is a classic and dont f with the classics!!!!!!!!!!!!! Timon and Pumba nala scar etc all so funny.	10
 i will be lion king	"""The lion king"" is a film that can accompany people to grow up, it brings people moved, the aftertaste is deep and long. The first time I saw it, I cried twice, once mufasa died and simba cried out in despair, and once at the end of the film simba stood on the rock of glory again and everything came back to life. The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue. The reason why this is a film with the growth of people, because from the film we can see their own growth. Like the protagonist simba, childhood carefree, naughty and brave."	10
 You are your own king.	"Just like the classic saying, what is in front of you is the right way and the easy way, which one do you choose? Do you choose to bury the trauma and live a simple life, or do you choose to face it and overcome it and live a glorious life? When Rafiki says ""It's time"", it means that Simba has completed his baptism of life. At the end of the movie, Simba steps heavily on the stone of glory in the rain in the tragic music. When he inherits the country, what he is about to face is not the smooth and glorious life, but the real and cruel life. But this is the real world. When you step out, you are your own king!"	9
 It's my childhiod	"""The place where the sun can shine is our land."" This is a classic that will be touched anytime, anywhere, and a hundred times. Every detail is so outstanding, every music is so pleasant, just funny and consistently moving."	10
 Review		9
 Perfection	When it comes to Disney it's hard to beat this movie. The remake is complete trash in comparison. The music is great, Hans Zimmer and Elton John can't be beat. The voice cast is perfect and no one can tell me there's a better person for Scar than Jeremy Irons. Skip the new one just watch this one.	10
 The true KING of The Lion King movies	One of the true classics of Disney that should enter any fan's Top 5 animated movie list. What happens to Simba and his dad is truly messed up and makes the Bambi Mom situation seem like an episode of Full House. Forget the unnecessary and frankly insulting remake: this is the King of Lion King films.	9
 Can't outdo the original	You just can't beat the OG Lion King! And if beyonce can't outdo it, you know nobody can. It will always be a staple in my house!	8
 Excellent Timeless Masterpiece..❤❤❤	The Lion King is one of the movies that Ihad seen in my childhood. It is a phenomenon of the ages. There is no film like it or never will be. Animated or not, this film is the best in everything. Characters have been portrayed so well in their contrasts and similarities, each being unique. The story is about every theme - Paternal and Maternal Love, Romance, Comedy, Betrayal, Guilt, Redemption and Reclamation. I saw the new one, and believe me, it sucked totally. Wouldn't even come within miles of this film. The jungle book is even more lively than the new one in 2019.Which brings me back to our Classic.The music is so genuine, 'Circle of Life', 'Be Prepared', ' I Just Can't Wait To Be King', Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' are so memorable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is epic. The cinematography grips you from the moment you watch it till the end. The animation is so genuine and heartfelt. It gives me the chills, the song of 'Be Prepared'. Overall a classic for the ages.❤❤❤	10
 Astonishing film of all centuries		9
 My Childhood	I have a lot of memories of my childhood linked to this film and i have watched it a ridiculous number of times.😄💖	10
 Childhood Fav	One of the best childhood favourite movie........I dont know how many time i watched this movie...............	10
 Lion king	This is mine personally my favourite Disney movie excluding Pixar for a couple of reasons to start off with I grew up with because most Disney movies if I didn't see as a kid but as an adult I probably wouldn't like them but when you rematch the ones you watched as a kid it's still good if that makes any sense for example I love Beauty and the beast and lion king because I watched them as a child but I never watched Little mermaid or Aladin as a kid(don't get mad at me) but I didn't like them as much because I diddint grow up with themThis also has the best music out of all of them I can name Hakunah Matatah, Be prepared, circle of life, Can you feel the love tonight, and Can't wait to be king off of my head cause they were great and co written by Elton John and that's part of why it was so memerable in short Lion king is great to rewatch older and good to watch with your kids	10
 A Masterpiece	Theres no doubt about it that the lion king is an amazing film.*****Now this review is going to be short and simple*******First of all the animation is amazing in this film astonishing, the acting is on point and the The music Is catchy, upbeat and fun.This film Really gets you emotionally ; You're sad when Simbas Dad Dies, you're happy when the trio sing Hakuna Matata And You're Satasfied when Simba defeats Scar.This is definitely in my opinion the best Disney Film	10
 The Lion King	"This is the ultimate ""amazing movie"" stereotype, but it was well earned."	10
 My Favorite Disney Film Ever		9
 A true classic from the old days	This 90s Disney movie was an instant classic and got back to its roots of great animated films...ie: Bambi, Dumbo, Fox & The Hound, Lady & The Tramp, etc. Wish they would go back to these types of animated films and get away from the digital ones of today.	10
 I will never stop loving this film	Is anyone else scared to see the 2019 version for fear of it tarnishing the original? I mean, I'm still going to see it, but the original Lion King was and is one of the most memorable animated films I've ever seen. I also think it's a perfect intro to loss for kids. It doesn't over-glorify it in a morose way, but doesn't sugar coat the topic either.	9
 Can you feel the love tonight!	Simba is a shining star!king of the rock!We really enjoyed watching this movie - it never gets old.Love Pumba aka Mr. Pig he is so funny,and we liked singing along to the soundtrack!The hyenas are really funny also :)	9
 AMazing!	A beautiful childhood tale! It's captivating, it's heartbreaking but endures a wonderful message!	10
 Amazing.	Movies was amazing. One of my favorite Disney movies. I cried when I first seen it.	10
 Something about it	Must be that Disney magic when you know you're in the middle of watching something that is truly spectacular...	10
 A Shakespeare inspired story told in beautiful narrative		10
 One of the greats		10
 Immaculate!	Having just seen the new CGI remake, it has solidified my view that the 1994 The Lion King is my favourite movie of all time.What the remake lost was the raw emotion that this movie evoked; the rolling of the eyes of Scar, the look of fear on young Simba's face when confronted with the stampede down the gorge. It helped to tell the story and it was absolutely perfect.The humour ... spot on. Music was at the right level that gave you goosebumps and that made you feel something. Voices/acting was perfect.I wouldn't have changed a thing.Immaculate	10
 The best animated Disney movie	This is my favorite movie ever. The first time I watched it I was a kid, but I know that as many times as I see it it will never get boring to me. Lion King will also teach you some important life situations, so I definitely recommend it to people of all ages.	10
 Grew Up With This Gem	"This film came out when I was 5 years old. Scar being Nala's father, Rafiki's tail being an inside joke with the guy who drew him, Whoopi Goldberg's dreads on Shenzi, and that lead up in the ending to the Six New Adventures series giving background on Scar and Mufasa, and Simba's first born son, and finally, showing that same sex couples can actually raise a child without any stigma, this film is just full of awesomeness. The wisest words anyone could ever take to heart, ""The past can hurt, but you can either run from it or learn from it"". Wise words from a wise mandrill.When it comes right down to it, this legendary classic will always have a place in my heart. I'm glad I grew up with it. I'm glad most 90's kids did. Nothing will ever compare to world of The Lion King."	10
 One of the greatest family movies of all time. Well done Disney	"""The Lion King,"" the death of Mufasa, the father of the lion cub who will someday become King. A Disney masterpiece that represents family and friendship. Timon is a great character that younger viewers will find very funny. A soundtrack that stand the test of time for people of all ages."	10
 So close to my heart!!!	Even at the age of 31,, this Disney movie is just the closest thing to my heart.. as a child I never understood why it attracted me so much but as a grown up & after losing my own father... every word in this movie seems to be written for me. So intense & heart warming at the same time spiritual ... love it	10
 Great family movie	One of Disney's best animated movies. The Lion King is a great movie for the whole family.	10
 Grew up with this film!	One of my favorite and the only one that actually would make me cry.	10
 Really good film	Great film really enjoyed it, think the lions are super cute	10
 pretty cool	This was my favorite childhood movie and it still is. It is quite emotional at some scenes.This movie is perfect to watch with family. The quality isn't that great because as you probably know its a very old movie. All in all i would rate this movie a 8/10 :)	8
 The circle of life!	The Lion king is one of my FAVORITE animated movies i ever seen, i will never get tired to this movie.	10
 First movie I watched in cinema, and I THANK GOD for this!	This movie is absolutely BEST ever! At least in my opinion... And I think I don't need to explain much, cause I don't want to ruin my adulthood.	9
 Heart touching movie!	Such a beautiful movie. Story is awesome which is filled with emotions and sentiments between dad and son relationship. I remember my days of childhood whenever I watch this movie. Tears roll out even now while watching the movie.	10
 ONE OF THE BEST ANIMATED FILMS EVER!	"With great story, voice acting, characters, animation and musical numbers, ""The Lion King"" is almost perfect, with one flaw caused by it's really short running time."	9
 Nostalgia	My all time childhood memoriesNever forgottenAll time favorite animated picture	10
 Great story for a great movie	It's very hard to come up with a story for a movie, but this one Disney film did just that. The story, animation, characters and the setting was amazing. A great movie for all ages young and old. I loved this movie as a kid growing up and now I like it a lot better, now that I'm older and it will never get old. Keeps getting better and better every time I watch it.	10
 A Timeless Classic	This movie will forever be a Disney favorite for generations to come.	10
 LOVE THIS MOVIE	This movie is a movie that everyone can enjoy. Its full of suspense and such a heart felt movie. It makes you see things from all angels.	10
 One of the best ever made!	I watch this movie as a child. And when I had kids, we watched it again. And when my children have kids, I will watch it with my grandkids. CLASSIC	10
 CLASSIC!	A modern Disney classic! Definitely show it to your kids :) Just be prepared for tears when Mufasa dies...	10
 An extraordinary Disney Classic	Absolutely thrilled to know this epic title made it to the theatres during my year of birth. From the exceptional animation and storytelling, to the epic music, what an achievement! Many thanks to each participant in the making of this film.	9
 Best movie ever	Simply the best movie is the world. A must watch. I first watched this movie when I was 3 years old. 22 years ago, and ever since then it has been my favourite. Showing the love between father and son - child and father. To know how the movie started out and go where it ended up is in itself astonishing. No complaints whatsoever. Everytime watching it feels like it's a first time.	10
 A Powerful Roar	Quick warning: This review DOES contain some minor spoilers like plot elements, but there's nothing too major and I'm sure most of you reading this have already seen the movie.Many people consider Disney's The Lion King to be one of their greatest films ever made, often praising the emotions, the character development, the humor, and the musical aspects. These much-praised aspects of the film are indeed worthy to be titled one of the best by Disney.What's the story? A lion cub crowned prince is tricked by a treacherous uncle into thinking he caused his father's death and flees into exile in despair, only to learn in adulthood his identity and his responsibilities.There are many great things to say about this movie, but without a doubt the best aspect of the whole movie is the animation. The way it breathes fresh air onto the environments, the designs of the animals, as well as having tons of color and energy, is very well done, and renders beautifully onto the screen. It's certainly one of the best looking Disney movies of all time. Another great thing about this movie is that the emotion is played very well. Unlike some other emotional films like The Good Dinosaur, the emotional scenes are appropriately emotional and they don't overdo anything on a sad scene. The reason why Mufasa's death is considered one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema history is because they play the emotion on very well, and they don't go absolutely crazy on making it sad. The musical numbers are not just catchy and timeless, they're examples of what Disney can do by taking a simple plot and turning it into a revolutionary musical. Many of the songs, like The Circle of Life and Hakuna Matata are well known by pretty much everyone. The only criticism I have to give is that sometimes it skips over some important plot elements, making some scenes feel either a bit rushed, or dragged on just to hit the film's 88 minute runtime. Fortunately, those scenes are uncommon, and the rest of the movie is fantastic for the most part.In conclusion, The Lion King is a powerful and uplifting Disney story that continues to be one of Disney's most iconic and exemplary films ever made. No matter what upcoming releases Disney pushes out, this film will always be remembered for an eternity.	9
 Favorite disney movie of all time	During my early young years, the lion king was my favorite disney ever. Even the music was so catchy. I literally knew every moments, and scenarios. Until now, I still rewatch it. Simba, Nala, Zazu, Rafiki, Mufasa, Timon and Pumbaa are the best.	10
 An A okay Movie	This movie is good for the whole family. And the songs in the movie are great as well	8
 A classic	This movie never gets old and can be rewatched at any age, a limitless number of times. Definitely a must-watch if you somehow have never seen it. Amazing in every area. 10 out of 10 recommend.	10
 Would recommend	Really good and entertaining, especially for children	10
 The Lion King: once again about a Masterpiece	"In a difficult situation is a person who undertakes to once again address to the topic of ""The Lion King"". According to the number of mentions in the media and among the conversations of ordinary people, he has long been on the same level with such parables as ""Titanic"", ""Terminator"" and ""Cleopatra"". And say about this cartoon, that either new extremely difficult. This with one hand.On the other hand, taking into account all said before now of course it is difficult to find someone who hadn't watched ""The Lion King"".Accordingly, in the details of the plot go there is no sense of the subtleties of the characters, too, can not be explained for the same reason.But there is an opportunity to focus on the story of the inner features of the masterpiece for which it is so loved for quite a long period of time.I'll start with the fact that the theme of giving animals human qualities in animation (and in some cases, and feature films) is not new.Remember the series ""Goofy and his team"", ""TaleSpin"", ""Duck stories"", ""Darkwing Duck"" ?These stories, familiar to us since childhood, serve as a brilliant confirmation of the above theory. But here's the amazing thing. None of these failed to achieve the naturalness of what is happening in ""The Lion King"".The characters of this cartoon do not wear human clothes and do not try to behave like people, which does not always appropriate comic and increases the sense of realism of the screen image.After 10-15 minutes after you start watching you began to think that animals really can talk, although an hour ago you were firmly convinced of the opposite. Not only that, the animals suddenly started talking in human language, their emotions may be quite to compete in the sincerity of the feelings and actions of living people.Even the famous Konstantin Stanislavsky would not find a reason to say his famous ""I do not believe!"" because the cartoon characters constantly and sincerely empathize.Many eternal philosophical questions are raised by ""The Lion King"": ""What is life? What's its meaning?"", ""How to find your way?"", ""Will we seem right that we as or think in 15 years when we're 25?"". All these questions the viewer will find the answer looking and reviewing this wonderful cartoon in which there was a place for all spiritual manifestations of man. Even the main negative character of the film Mufasa's brother Scar figure is not as unambiguous as it may seem at first.Of course in the struggle for power, he does not shun the lowest methods, but in all he is not right from a political point of view?He and his older brother just have diametrically different views on how to rule the state.Mufasa mostly relies on his strength, he, in modern parlance, professes a totalitarian regime.Scar in the soul is more democratic. He says plainly: ""With regard to mind I got the lion's share, but on the part of brute force is out of a genetic misfire"". He's cunning and hypocritical on occasion. Isn't that an important quality for a politician? Isn't that an important quality for a sovereign? Our unforgettable Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin would estimate that for certain.Someone can argue with that citing the example of what happened to the Pride Lands during the reign of Scar. Recognize, Liony played too much and made a huge mistake: did not secure the support of the people and too much dissolved hyenas -traditional enemies of lions. Scar not change his nature and whether he in this situation behave wiser cartoon would end quite differently.Anyway, but nevertheless this story has a happy ending and despite the controversy of many moments I am convinced that this happy end heroes deserved. They made the right choice although for many of them it was not easy to make.Even Timon and Pumbaa decided support his friend Simba in a difficult minute. Quote: ""Simba, if this is important to you we are with you until the end"". TimonAnd they have always been true Epicureans and never bothered with complex issues of morality and law.Well, when you need to help loved ones, each of us can become better and it's wonderful.

 The Movie That Means So Much More To Me Now.		10
 The Lion King will work your tear glands- irrespective of your age	"One of the most beloved animated films The Lion King is a great take on Shakespeare's Hamlet. It must have been clever on the part of the studio heads to use the Shakespearean template and apply it to one of the most beloved of animals- the Lion. The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are very good and the soundtrack, albeit criticized as not being as memorable as other Disney films in some corners usually gets it right. The spectacular ""circle of life"" to open the film should be singled out. This is one of the best films of the Disney Renaissance period."	
 PERFECTION	Must watch. it's a favorite for many different reasons. a classic.	10
 Words can't describe how good and special this film is.	Oh, this simply has to be the greatest animation film ever. The film features a host of interesting, lovable characters and a fantastic plot, with a few lessons to be learnt in there, as well. The musical element in the film is entertaining and thoroughly enjoyable. The animation is wonderful for its time, and the voice overs are done by an exceptional cast, in particular Whoopi Goldberg and Jeremy Irons.This is one to watch again and again, but be sure to have some tissues handy, as well, as the film will make you just as emotional at times as it will make you cry with laughter! The film also has a fantastic score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer.	10
 Hamlet in disguise	As most people probably know by now, this is a ripoff of Shakespeare's story Hamlet. I don't really like the movie, but I cannot say that it doesn't have it's moments where it is good. The songs are memorable and it makes a classic play's plot easy to follow but changes the ending to where it's happy and kid friendly. Definitely worth at least watching it once and showing it to your kids when they're old enough to enjoy it but not understand the entire plot and the background of it.	6
 circle of life	"I really enjoyed watching this movie with my 5 year old boy. The name of the song ""circle of life"" really defines the movie ."	9
 Life changing		10
 The Best of Disney	First movie I remember seeing, the standards for animated movies have been set high	9
 The Best of the Classics (Maybe even better appreciated by adults than children)		9
 Best Animated Movie Ever Made	The Lion King is Disney's best movie ever cause it shows us how to face and solve problems we face and how to deal with the past even thought it is very rough. When i first saw this movie and saw Mufasa risk his life to save simba that made me almost cry cause it shows that parents will do anything to make sure that you will always be okay even though it turns out bad when simba finds out his father passed away. Still to this day this movie makes me think of how i should face the past and determined my future cause i always don't know what do in my life all the times but like simba when he faces his past he knows what is right and what to do	10
 The lion king (spoiler alert)	The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd Disney animated feature film. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton. The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as King of the Pride Lands; however, after Simba's uncle Scar (Mufasa's jealous younger brother), murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was not responsible and runs away Upon living with two lady slobs (Tomen & lumbar). Simba is greeted by a valuable childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to a place once called home to challenge his uncle (Scar) to end his leadership and take his place in the Circle of Life as the rightful King.	10
 A children's (and adult's) classic!		9
 One of my favorite animated films ever	"""The Lion King"" has been such an important part of so many childhoods since it came out, but what is so remarkable is that, whereas some childhood entertainment loses a lot of luster once the nostalgia- goggles come off, I find my appreciation for this film to grow the older I get. I personally don't believe Disney has yet created a more beautiful film, since it isn't just a detailed rendition of African wildlife, but its such a deliriously colorful and expressively animated film to boot. The story is honest in its portrayal of the corruption that exists in the world, but more importantly, in the hope that good moral judgement can overcome such corruption. The voice cast is pitch- perfect, the soundtrack remains the absolute greatest in animated film history, and the script (while perhaps not wholly original) deftly balances searing emotional truths with charmingly silly antics."	9
 Wonderful movie	An amazing movie. One of my favorites from my childhood! It is full of shocking moments, sad moments, and happy moments. It is a movie I will keep forever on my shelf and take off once a year to put it in the DVD player. I cannot express how many good memories from my childhood this movie makes me relive. If no one has seen this movie yet, I will be baffled.	10
 Simply amazing		10
 The Best Animated Movie of All Time	When thinking of animated gems, The Lion King is the first thing to come to mind. Everything in this film is near perfection in execution,and is flawless when hitting beats of emotion. This is a movie that has it all, a great cast, flawless music, as well as fantastic story. I strongly erge everyone to see this in theaters when it plays, if not only to simply support this master piece. No matter what mood you are in I guarantee enjoyment from this picture. 10/10	10
 Wonderful, perfect	I watched this film in 1994 when I was 10. I remember being astonished, thrilled and completely absorbed in this story. And there were tears, of course. The colours, theme song, animal movements - they're all perfect. I bought The Lion Kids DVD a few days ago, for my kids now, and I can say that the magic is still there. The themes are universal - love, family relations, betrayal, growing up...so everyone can relate to the story and feel the emotions. And the great thing is that it is not only appealing to children but to adults as well. The Lion King is a great mixture of singing and musical elements, appealing and cute animal characters, great animation, beautiful African landscape and serious themes of rivalry, betrayal and fratricide.	9
 A Disney Masterpiece from its '90s peak	"While compared at times to ""Bambi"" due to the similarities in its central story, ""The Lion King"" is so much more than a modern retelling of Disney's 1942 film. Ushering in the full blown revamped Disney brand, this Academy Award winning film is also one of the most mature from Disney's high point period. Focusing on the life of young lion cub and future king, Simba, we follow the naive cub as his life is uprooted in a terrible tragedy and forces him to run away, but years later return and fight for his rightful place.Disney assembles one of their greatest voice casts to portray the vast arrays of characters from the African savanna. James Earl Jones brings his distinctly deep voice to the wise king of Pride Rock, Mufasa, while English thespian Jeremy Irons voices his wicked brother, Scar, the film's central villain and most foppish bad guy in the Disney cannon. Child star Johnathan Taylor Thomas voices the young Simba to youthful perfection while Matthew Broderick voices the adult Simba (as I've grown up, Broderick's vocal performance is mismatched for Simba's adulthood when Simba finally grows up and takes responsibility for his past). Comedic talents Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin voice two of Scar's hyena lackeys, Shenzi and Banzai, with a mostly maniacal laughing performance from veteran voice actor, Jim Cummings, as third hyena lackey, Ed. And stealing the film's comedic spotlight are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon, the meerkat, and Phumba, the warthog. The duo are the characters who taught us all that ""Hakuna Matata"" means 'no worries' and made us laugh with their constant bickering and hilarious exchanges and actions.Following in Disney's tradition for using live reference models, the animation team traveled to Kenya to sketch the landscape of the savanna. The company also had live animals from lions, meerkats, warthogs and various birds brought into the studio by zookeepers in addition to seeing the wildlife in action in their native habitat. Complimenting the amazing visuals is the Oscar winning score by Hans Zimmer and Oscar winning songwriting team of Elton John and Tim Rice. Zimmer's instrumental score paints the dramatic picture in musical tones, but does express joy at the film's happiest moments, while Sir Elton and Tim Rice add the dramatic and comedic lyrics to compliment Zimmer's lush orchestral score."	10
 A classic!	Oh how I love this film!! This is such a classic Disney film! The reason this film is a classic is because of how big it is and how beautiful the animation is and the characters, the characters, the characters!!! These are some of the most likable and unique characters that I have ever seen in a movie ever. Simba is such a sweet character and from the get-go you wanna explore the jungle with him and you want to sing I Just Can't Wait To Be King with him as well!! Timon and Pumbaa are so sweet and funny and you can tell that they really care about Simba. Mufasa and Scar are such amazing characters and aah I just love this movie so much. This movie will always be a classic to me and I will always wanna watch it again and again.	9
 Not just a superior film for kids but for all ages	The Lion King is a 1994 Walt Disney animated movie about a little lion Prince, Simba born in a lion royalty and his jealous uncle, Scar who wants to take the throne from his brother, Mufasa. Scar kills Mufasa and Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was his fault, and so he flees the Kingdom into exile. In his exile, he meets some of our favorite childhood characters Timon and Pumbaa.The Lion King is a movie of exhilarating surprises and at its times it wasn't just a movie it was a marketing phenomenon. Simba is played by two actors, younger version Johnathan Taylor Thomas and older version Matthew Broderick. The movie also stars Darth Vader himself James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Ernie Sabella as Pumba, Nathan Lane as Timon and many more.The Lion King is one of the most respected animated movies. Often times people have compared the story to William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Let's just also mention the stunning visual miracles by 600 Disney artisans, who bring the African landscape to stunning life. It's that kind of animation artistry that raises The Lion King above the level of superior kid stuff and into the realm of a royal treat.	10
 my favorite ever Disney!	"This is without doubt my favorite ever Disney Movie! Cheerful and uplifting all round :) perfect for the whole family -children and adults! It has some sad parts near the beginning of the film but it gets happier and some very cute scenes with nice songs all the children and family can sing along too. i really wish they would make a remake of this amazing film like they have doe with some of the other Disney films, but you still can't beat a classic Disney! I also love the sing-along version of this film!!! I must say as a bit of a Disney connoisseur you can't top this in my opinion! Good story line and moral to the story!!! The best song in the movie is definitely ""the circle of life"". Just a truly amazing film!"	10
 The Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen	I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say 'haha, he's dead', you say 'Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.	10
 The best movie.	"""THE LION KING"" is the best animated movie in the Movies history. Whenever I used to go to my uncles house for holidays, I used to watch his movie at least twice a day along with my another favourite movie ""THE JUNGLE BOOK"". Even my uncle and others used to get irritated by me, but that din't stop me. Especially the songs and ""THE CIRCLE OF LIFE"" is my favourite song, sentiment, background score what not, every aspect caught my heart. Still I will watch this movie whenever I get the chance, especially I love the scene between Young Simba and Mufasa where Mufasa saves the kid from hyenas. And the animation is of other world. And I urge every kid in my locality whenever they come to me, to watch this movie just for the sake of Dialogues. I kind of loved the line from the baboon about the past of simba and what to do with his future. And the conversation between Simba with Mufasa from the heaven."	10
 The best animation movie of all time	Disney, Pixar, Ghibli... all of them have created wonderful movies which I can call classics. If I have to chose my 2nd most favorite movie, it will be really hard. However, if I have to choose my most favorite, there is no other than Lion King. Although it is a Disney movie, it is not just a movie for kids. You will enjoy this movie no matter how old you are. A classical plot, of course since it is inspired by Hamlet, can be easy to predict, but you will find all the little things and details combine together to make such a masterpiece. The opening - and of course the ending, the songs, Hakuna Matata, the lessons, the magnificent African view, the characters, the voice... The lessons in the movie is sure worth notice. The past can be hurt, but it is in the past! Sure, not typical magical Disney with a fantasy world. It's dark, betrayal, death, the fallen... But hey, that's what make it great!	10
 Brilliant Musical	This film is not only an incredible narrative but a wonderfully brilliant and imaginative score that puts this musical at number one permanently. Each character has been thoroughly fleshed out and that is very satisfying for an animated film. It seems The Lion King created the landscape in which all animated features were to be based off. The film captures the African culture and the importance of the pride lands in this beautiful representation of wild life and the circle of life. From its rich visuals, and incredible music from Elton John and Hanz Zimmer there will never be a musical that nearly reaches this epic animated film.It will be hard to ever reach the success and popularity of The Lion King. But what this film has done is created a breathtakingly beautiful narrative that many generations to come will enjoy and learn from.	
 Lion King	I loved this movie. This movie was always one of my favorites growing up as a kid also. I have probably watched it around 20 times up until the age of 17. I love the story line behind it because it teaches a life lesson that you'll never forget. The movie doesn't justhave a good story and intrigue the viewers, but it has a lesson that kids would be able to follow. I have also seen the Lion King play on Broadway about 3 times and it is amazing. I will never forget this movie because of the lesson behind it.I know that the movie is from 1994, but I hope that kids from today's society watch the movie just to learn the lesson.	9
 Awesome Film	Awesome Film I love the story and idea concept. It is a family oriented movie with laughs, morals, and values. It was a lesson learned from a youth and took that and made it a positive at the end of the day. The film Simba was a young lioness who was very Innocent and naive as a youngster. Only to be manipulated by his so called uncle that ended up persuading him that he was the reason his dad got killed. But to only realized as he become older that all of it was a lie. He found out that his uncle was the one to have set him up. So in revenge, he goes back as an adult lion to fight for his pride and territory. By doing this, he was able to continue the legacy his father have paved for him.	
 Emotional carousel	I dedicate my first IMDb review to one of my most favorite movies of my childhood. Disney did an amazing job on this one. When I watched it as a child I loved it so much one time seeing this wasn't enough for me, so I've watched about 5 times in total. It took me through an emotional carousel in days when I was little and even years later when I watched it again I couldn't resist shedding the tears again. It was always very atmospheric and the characters are well made. The animation is very beautiful and story makes a big impression. I'm definitely going to show this masterpiece to my kids and teach the way of life to them when I've ones.	10
 the best children's film	The Lion King is a great movie, despite being a little strong in some scenes involving loss, death, friendship, family, happiness, sadness and honor.the movie from beginning to end is this attentive and every moment of difficulty would like being able to help, scar being family shows similar things in the sometimes real life we are filled with envy and hatred and allowed us to death in the greatest the cases.It is part of my childhood and is a movie experience than ever I forget, a few years ago in my adulthood I saw the premiere of King León 3D movie screens certainly were tears Flower skin.is a movie that leaves messages like finding our place in the great circle of life and value family and friends. I give this film a perfect 10.	10
 One if the Greats		10
 Not just king of the lions.	Deep in Disney's renaissance period, and before computer animation stole the cartoon industry, The Lion King is one of the most mature animated movies out there, and, by extension, the best animated movie by Disney. This movie deals with a multitude of different harrowing, real-world struggles, like the death of a close family member, growing up, and accepting responsibility for your own actions. The animation is classical, the voice acting is terrific, the story is a great twist on Shakespeare's, Hamlet, and, above all, Hans Zimmer's score is sad, and gut-wrenching. In my humble opinion, this movie is the pinnacle of Disney's creations and deserves all the hype that it generates.	
 Greatest Disney	By far the most enjoyable Disney movie of all time, it will never get old. An absolute classic if I ever did see one. It has action, comedy, adventure, emotion, drama and romance, what more do you need. A story of how a young lion cub is led to believe that he is responsible for his fathers tragic death manages to overcome his fears and guilt from the past and rise to save the kingdom of Pride Rock. Simba, the Son of King Mufasa, runs away from his home and makes friends with a Puma and Meerkat who teach him the ways of survival in the wild. Evil uncle, Scar, takes over Pride Rock and fills it with misery. When Simba's childhood friend/love interest, Narla, comes searching for food and stumbles upon Simba's whereabouts, a new turn of events brings hope to Pride Rock. A great film. 10/10	10
 Really Good!	The Lion King is a story that we all know. After watching it as a very young child, I decided to watch it again as a 15 year old. This story follows Simba, the next in line to be King. His father, Mufasa is killed by Scar, his brother, however Simba is taught by Scar that it is his fault. He runs away, only to meet new people and learn new outlooks on how to live life. I review this film in the mind of a child. It was warming to the heart, action packed (but not too much because you know, kids) and even enriching to the mind. Just what you want in a film for children, and what Disney generally delivers. It however does not have the magic that people are expecting in a Disney film, but that is not to be expected. It did not however make me feel as child like as other Disney films. This movie is solid, and a great watch for all of the family.	8
 Outstanding	Have you ever watch a movie that will never stop bringing you joy or overwhelming with peace and love? Well, if not you should really consider The Lion King. Although the movie came out when in 1994 this is a movie that the whole family enjoy. One of my all time favorite movies 22 years later. It doesn't get any better than this movie people. The characters, voice overs, and soundtrack is all a in quality. My suggestion is even if you have watched the movie before (which I'm sure you have) grab your loved ones some snacks and turn on the surround sound watch it. As we get older and there are very few greats out like this one it will make you feel good to pass the movie down to the little people of your family. Thank you for your time and enjoy. Blessing to you all.	10
 This Movie is a Must Watch for Everyone No Matter your Age	"The Lion King is a timeless classic that should be shared with every generation. The evident message of freedom from the past and finding the strength to move on is something that so many people not only need to be told can happen but can see it happen. With all the colorful scenery and talking animals it's easy to get lost in the magic and wrapped up in child-like awe. From the rising of the sun to the echoing roars that fill your hearts with hope, there isn't a single moment of boredom or loss of interest. The first time experiencing the fun playfulness of Nala and Simba in an attempt to lose Zazu and sneak off the elephant graveyard will make you think Mufasa's tone is a little too strict for the situation. But as the conversation between the two lions continues it becomes evident that Mufasa's only concern is his son's safety and comprehension of what a big responsibility being king really is. Simba's uncle Scar hatches a plan to murder Mufasa and blames Simba for the ""accident."" This sadly is a representation of how many children and teens will see a negative situation. Unfortunately they see it as their fault and like Simba they run away from their past thinking that once it's behind them they never have to face it again. The thing is, like Nala found Simba, a person's past will always find them. They can either choose to continue running, which usually doesn't last long (another situation also represented by Simba), they can face it with only the people from their past that still love them (Nala), or they can trust a little and let in the people from their past and present and accept help from them all. There are so many life lesson's in the Lion King and the fun songs and goofy comments from Scar are just what wraps it all up in a nice neat bow."	10
 A wonderful kid's movie	The lion king is a wonderful kid movie that even someone older can love. This movie holds adult jokes that go right over kids heads and make them wonder why their parents are laughing. The main villain (Scar) is by all rights the best Disney villain. He is sarcastic, sympathetic, and just straight up evil. The hero (Simba) is lovable although not sympathetic, his side-kicks more than make up for what he lacks. Timon and Pumba are funny, classic comedy relief characters. They lead Simba through adulthood teaching him Hakuna Matata (do no quote me on the spelling). With wonderful musical numbers, this is definitely one Disney movie that will not die.	10
 Amazing!!!! Activated my feelings...	This is my all time movie simply because it activated my feelings in me. At the age of 5 i saw this movie and it was a video cassette. from that day on I never forgot the moment i pressed play. The moment where I cried and my feelings where activated to the world. I still have the video cassette and i will keep it because it has a meaning which can't be sold. Lion King has also made me realise that the world isn't just about humans and we humans ain't the only creatures on earth with feelings. I really hope kids these days would watch it and realise how strong of a movie it is and who knows if that could bring Lion King the movie out using the latest technology to attract the new generations. Just so you know the meaning that this movie has for me and is so strong, that my first tattoo is Simba the one that the monkey draws on the tree. when its done i shall post a picture up. Anyway people, stay loved and blessed.	10
 The Greatest Animated Movie of ALL TIME.	The Lion King is by far The Greatest Animated Movie of ALL TIME. Like most humans, The Lion King was an important part of our young lives. We frolicked with Simba and Nala, laughed along with Timon and Pumbaa, and fast forwarded through that really sad part that we can't even mention. We learned about right and wrong and the importance of following your heart. t has everything from youthful naiveté to unforeseen loss and betrayal, all things we face in life. It was one of the hardest Disney flicks to sit through (because of that unbearably tragic scene with which we're all familiar), but it certainly prepared me for trying to become the best possible version of myself.	10
 Over 20 years on, The Lion King is still a masterpiece		10
 Good children and inspirational movie	While I may be biased because I was young when this came out I always enjoyed the lion king. It had a good plot and was not designed too throw children off. Like all children's stories there is a problem and then an arc and a solution. I think Disney did a good job keeping the feeling of grief too a minimum. It almost seemed as though they were outlining Simba's strength through the loss of Mufasa. As a child I watched many movies but none I enjoyed as much as the lion king. It makes kids think about life and responsibility. It is about having strength and courage when you don't think you do. It shows kids it is,never too late too fix a mistake even if it is in the past. I recommend this too anyone with kids or well anyone!	10
 Perfection	This film is my childhood. As an individual who studied acting and music professionally... this piece of work is near perfection. Great classical story structure, unforgettable music, and overall Disney masterpiece. I highly advise that all who love this film go see the Broadway production in Times Square. You will NOT be disappointed with the work that they brought to the stage for this all-time Disney stellar. Furthermore, if any individual has yet to see this animated feature film... adult or child... it's NOT too late! Please let this production become a part of you. If you consider this, appreciation for traditional animation will hit an all-time high.	10
 Best Animated Film Ever		10

 Childhood memories	This movie brings back so much memories! Love the movie and the songs in it. Its one of Disney's best animated movie, because of the story and the music. The songs in the movie are great as sing along as well as listening to them. Its also awesome characters in the movie that have funny lines / quotes! Here is my list of favorite quotes from the movie:Adult Simba : man, i'm stuffed. Pumbaa: Me too, I ate like a pig. Adult Simba : Pumbaa, you ARE a pig.Pumbaa : it's our motto Young Simba : What's a motto? Timon : Nothing.What's a motto with you?Scar : i'm surrounded by idiotsMy favorite songs in this movie is : Be prepared - by Tim Rice & sir Elton John The morning report - was not in the original movie, but was added to the special edition version and it's written by Tim Rice & sir Elton John.This movie is great for everyone! So enjoy the movie with friends & family!=)	10

Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. love this movie i will suggest to watch this movie you will enjoy.animals can think they also have feeling and desires they also want to live freely and happily in their own world we should not waste forest and should protect forest	7
 amazing child hood show	"My generation grew up mourning the death of Bambi's mother. Now comes ""The Lion King,"" with the death of Mufasa, the father of the lion cub who will someday be king. The Disney animators know that cute little cartoon characters are not sufficient to manufacture dreams. There have to be dark corners, frightening moments, and ancient archetypes like the crime of regicide. ""The Lion King,"" which is a superbly drawn animated feature, is surprisingly solemn in its subject matter, and may even be too intense for very young children.The film is the latest in a series of annual media events from Disney, which with ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"" reinvented its franchise of animated feature films. The inspiration for these recent films comes from the earliest feature cartoons created by Walt Disney himself, who in movies like ""Dumbo,"" with the chaining of Mrs. Jumbo, and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" with its wicked stepmother, tapped into primal fears and desires. Later Disney films drifted off into the neverland of innocuous ""children's movies,"" which were harmless but not very exciting. These most recent four animated features are once again true ""family films,"" in that they entertain adults as well as children.""The Lion King"" is the first Disney animated feature not based on an existing story. In another sense, it is based on half the stories in classical mythology. It tells the tale of the birth, childhood and eventual manhood of Simba, a lion cub. The cub's birth is announced in the opening sequence of the movie, called ""The Circle of Life,"" which is an evocative collaboration of music and animation to show all of the animals of the African veld gathering to hail their future king. The cute little cub is held aloft from a dramatic spur of rock, and all his future minions below hail him, in a staging that looks like the jungle equivalent of a political rally.Of course this coming together of zebra and gazelle, monkey and wildebeest, fudges on the uncomfortable fact that many of these animals survive by eating one another. And all through ""The Lion King"" the filmmakers perform a balancing act between the fantasy of their story and the reality of the jungle. Early scenes show Simba as a cute, trusting little tike who believes everyone loves him. He is wrong. He has an enemy - his uncle Scar, the king's jealous brother, who wants to be king himself one day.Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film, and Scar is one of the great ones, aided by a pack of yipping hyenas who act as his storm troopers. With a voice by Jeremy Irons, and facial features suggestive of Irons' gift for sardonic concealment, Scar is a mannered, manipulative schemer who succeeds in bringing about the death of the king.Worse, he convinces Simba that the cub is responsible, and the guilty little heir slinks off into the wastelands. (The movie makes a sly reference to a famous earlier role by Irons. When Simba tells him, ""You're so weird,"" he replies ""You have no idea,"" in exactly the tone he used in ""Reversal of Fortune."") It is an unwritten law that animated features have comic relief, usually in the form of a duet or trio of goofy characters who become buddies with the hero. This time they are a meerkat named Timon (voice by Nathan Lane) and a warthog named Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), who cheer up Simba during his long exile.The movie has a large cast of other colorful characters, including a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), who is confidant and adviser to King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). And there are the three hyenas (with voices by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings), who are a tumbling, squabbling, yammering team of dirty tricks artists.The early Disney cartoons were, of course, painstakingly animated by hand. There has been a lot of talk recently about computerized animation, as if a computer program could somehow create a movie. Not so. Human animators are responsible for the remarkably convincing portrayals of Scar and the other major characters, who somehow combine human and animal body language. But computers did assist with several remarkable sequences, including a stampede in which a herd seems to flow past the camera.Despite the comic relief from the hyenas, the meerkat and the warthog, ""The Lion King"" is a little more subdued than ""Mermaid,"" ""Beauty"" and ""Aladdin."" The central theme is a grim one: A little cub is dispossessed, and feels responsible for the death of its father.An uncle betrays a trust.And beyond the gently rolling plans of the great savanna lies a wasteland of bones and ashes. Some of the musical comedy numbers break the mood, although with the exception of ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata,"" the songs in ""The Lion King"" are not as memorable as those in ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty."" Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals that the ads might lead you to expect. Although the movie may be frightening and depressing to the very young, I think it's positive that ""The Lion King"" deals with real issues. By processing life's realities in stories, children can prepare themselves for more difficult lessons later on. The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to ""Hamlet,"" is a learning experience as well as an entertainment."	10
 Disney's best film paws down!	I first saw The Lion King when I was about 5 years old, I was hooked from the start and found it was unlike any other Disney movie I have ever seen since then. Sure, there are heroes in Disney that search for their destiny in life in other films, but The Lion King tells it in a unique light, with a much deeper meaning. The Lion King has many great point, from the music, down to the detail for characters, with some really good lessons for Your kids that will possibly help them later in their lives. One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the Characters, I enjoyed how real they were, it made me feel like I was in the movie. The realistic behavior of Simba and Nala as children was on point, it shows how kids are innocent and don't know any better, while also showing the view point of an adult, and the dynamic between Father and son. I also liked the strong scenes in the film, when Mufasa appeared in the clouds to speak to Simba I was taken back, because it actually made me feel something in my heart, it deeply touched me. Further more I loved how the characters had flaws, but their good characteristics balanced with the bad (all except for Scar). The movie goes through points of development, and many emotions. The animation, and attention to detail in this movie was wonderful, it was extremely well done, well thought out, and well planned. This is truly Disney's best film as many people say, this movie will stick with me, and will forever remain timeless.	10
 Childhood Movie	Most amazing movie i watched growing up as a kid i loved it and think every new generation of kids should watch this.the way it teaches lessons to kids in this movie can be applied to the real world. the songs are amazing and the voices of the characters are good also. Graphics have improved since when i was younger till now. I also recommend the other Lion King's should be watched too. My favorite character is Simba's best friend shows a strong friendship their also. Just very awesome and for the whole family kind of movies. I think kids and adults of all ages and sizes can enjoy this. its a great bonding experience for everyone the whole family. Keeps you at the edge of your seat every moment.	10
 The greatest animated film of all time.	"Review Amazing, absolutely amazing; a masterpiece in American cinema! The Lion King was what originally got me interested in the art of film and is one of my all time favorites.I had not actually seen The Lion King when it was released in 2012 for almost 5 years, and I was hoping it would hold up and I am so happy that it did. In fact, looking back I probably enjoy it more now than when I did when I was younger, there is so much more to talk about such as the music, the storytelling, the voice acting among many other elements. First of all, Simba; Simba is one of the most sympathetic Disney characters, we have all been in a situation where we have felt the need to step up and rise to an occasion and Simba represents that perfectly, he (as an adult) tries to come off as confident but you can tell he is hurting and is conflicted inside but eventually puts this fear aside to do what he knows he must. The supporting characters were all great, particularly the hyenas who I find a lot funnier now, maybe because of my twisted sense of humor. Scar as the villain was awesome, one of the best movie villains ever. He is a silver-tonged devil, he manipulates his nephew and tries to get him killed then actually kills his own brother, which is a lot deeper when you really think about it. We also get some good humor out of him as well, you also see how pathetic he is when he takes over, showing how unfit he is to be king.The songs were awesome, the opening sequence ""The Circle of Life"" is the greatest sequence ever and when I'm watching the film, I always watch it at least thrice. The songs range from being jumpy to traditionally African to menacing to slow and romantic, the greatest range in a Disney film. Overall, Disney had it back then and still has it today."	10
" ""Masterpiece"" is a gross understatement"	Saw this movie when it came out in theaters...saw this movie in 3D in theaters...own this movie in 3D at home. Have seen every sequel, saw the Broadway show twice and plan on seeing it again. What more can you say about this movie? It is timeless, Disney's first original full length animation that was completely their own story, and they may not ever be able to top that. The Lion King will be an all ages favorite for generations to come and people will be singing the music for their whole lives. The Lion King teaches you so many life lessons and all the while you're singing, dancing, and crying along with it. It also was backed by Elton John on the soundtrack which just makes it more epic.	10
 The King of Coincidence		10
 Sage tale	For many films for children , the story is only pretext. For gorgeous images and beautiful characters, for nice events and love stories, for best office and reasonable memories. And it is enough ! In this case,all is the story . Characters, love question, silly friends are only pieces of a precise watch. The evil, the good, the young lion, the jungle, the crumbs from Hamlet and usual magic are just ingredients for a lesson told in different style. Tale about responsibilities, it is pledge for universal values. Not exposure but introduction. Not teach but tell. Result - an interesting parable and a hero very strange in the characters collection. A kind of Bambi but more sophisticated. Picture of evolution, sketch of levels of victory, in same skin of songs and joy, with same slices of tension, it is a precious fairy tale about humanity.	
 Lion King 3D	Lion King 3D The Lion King is a movie that leaves you awing. This movie is where you can take your kids and family to watch it. This movie is for all ages. When watching it in 3D you feel as if you're actually in it. It is a movie that leaves you happy. The colors in the movie were fantastic. They were very clear and colorful. The plot of the movie is extremely grateful. Also the animation is very vivid. When watching it with a family it brings the family close to each other. I was very pleased with watching this movie. It was beyond great. I would rate this movie five stars. This movie is about a group of lions that all are family in a way. The King has a son which hopes to be like his father. The Kings brother is very angry that he is not going to be king some day. The uncle of the baby lion tricks the baby lion into trying to kill his father who is king. When the uncle kills the King, he blames the son of the King. The uncle tells him to leave and never come back. As the baby lion grows up he runs into one of his old friends. She tells him what has happened to their land. So then he must go back and save their land. He returns and saves his land.	
 This movie is a one of a kind Disney classic.		8
 A another jungle classic from Disney		10
 Love it	Not a lot to say about this movie other than it has a great cast. Top notch all of the way. The only weak thing for me is the love story between Simba and Nala. I did not buy into it when I was 11 and I did not buy into later in my life. The only weak point that seems really forced. I guess another weak point is the scar song. It is a fun song, but it does not seem like it fits into the rest of the movie. I love the music and probably one of my one favorite soundtracks that I can think of. Visually it was a great meshing of technology and hand drawn animation. It really is epic in its scope and the opening scene is a perfect way of building the universe. Great movie with lots of great memories.	9
 A brilliant animation.	Because of the release of The Princess and the Frog, I will be reviewing Disney classics from the past. One of them is The lion king. A smart, funny, sad animated feature. Surely it isn't as good as Beauty and the beast, but it is still a lovable tale of excitement.The lion king is the story of Simba(voiced by Johnathon Taylor Thomas). When Simba is born, it is announced that he will become king if his father(voiced by James Earl Jones) dies. The king's brother Scar(voiced by the great Jeremy Irons) isn't happy because he knows that he'll never be king.So Scar pulls off an evil scheme and tricks Simba into believing that he is a murderer. So Simba runs off and Scar takes over. Later on in life, we see Simba(now voiced by Matthew Broderick)hanging around with Timone and Pumba(Timone is voiced by Nathan Lane). Also, when an old friend of Simba's walks back into his life he realizes many things. He also realizes what he must do.The lion king isn't as good as Beauty and the beast or something like that. But it is indeed a great movie. It's a movie that you'll never forget. The characters are never going to be forgotten either. The lion king is a fantastic movie.The lion king:****/****	10
 Disney's last hurrah in the jungle		8
 Excellent animation quality but average storyline with dull mid-section	'The Lion King' is a watchable cartoon feature with a serviceable plot line but excellent animation. The opening sequence is breath-taking. There's also an amazing stampede later in the film that feels stunningly real. There are some fine songs by Elton John. Alas, the story isn't as great. The plot is loosely inspired from Hamlet but feels rather feudal. The mid-section tends to sag. The film goes overboard in its depiction of the villain Scar (a fine Jeremy Irons) by giving him pronounced 'asiatic' features as opposed to the good lions. Despite these misgivings, the film remains entertaining.Overall 7/10	
 The perfect film to make you happy when you're upset! :)		8
 The Greatest Disney Film Ever Made.	Forget The Little Mermaid or Beauty And The Beast, this IS the greatest Disney film ever made. It contains all the warmth and fun that a Disney film should have. This is a genuine film, and no other Disney film could be any better. With a superb cast and 5 songs that will make you sing all day through, this is the real deal. Just a word of warning, if you have little 'uns watching this film, you should watch it with them; there are a couple of scary scenes and a death scene involved, so you may want to check this film to see if it is suitable for your kids at home. But to make up for not-so-nice parts, there's plenty of fun, for all the family. This IS the movie for avid Disney fans, and even people who don't really have a taste for Walt Disney films, this is the perfect family film. And how could we forget the lovable duo, the one and only Timon And Pumbaa! You will just want to watch this film over and over again, because of the purity this Disney film has. And if you're hungry for more Lion King antics, there's also The Lion King 2, Simba's Pride and The Lion King 1 1/2. But don't just take my word for it, watch it for yourself and experience all the magic of The Lion King.	10
 Very good movie; Very good story; SIMBA OWNS	"Disney made another solid A in cinemas everywhere around the world in 1994 with ""The Lion King,"" a very nice animated film.It is about Simba, a young lion whose father was Mufasa, the original king of the Pride Lands. That opening scene where Rafiki broke open the gourd, made a mark on Simba's head with the juice and dust and lifted him towards the sun from Pride Rock is the most recognizable scene of the movie, because that's how it all began. As Simba had grown up, he had to learn about his issues in life, try to stay away from trouble (that scene where Mufasa and Simba had a long talk ""SIMBA, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED IN YOU, etc."" TOTALLY taught Simba a lesson; after that was the whole ""Look at the stars"" thing), and later, as a wildebeest stampede, started by Scar, killed Simba's father, now Simba had to grow up all alone and try to figure this whole thing out all by himself.Later, Simba was lost in the desert with vultures and stuff, and here, enter Timon and Pumbaa. This recognizable phrase, Hakuna Matata, started to change Simba's life, as well as moviegoers', forever! Then we see Simba, Pumbaa, and Timon (with his funny walk) walk across the log in the night, with Simba becoming an adult! Simba then had fallen in love with Nala, and later on, when Simba was worried, Rafiki had come to him, told Simba to look in the water, and Simba decided to return to Pride Rock to become king.Pride Rock was a bad wasteland; how sad was that. Suddenly, Simba realized that Scar killed Mufasa, and so, they battled on Pride Rock with a fire below!!!!! Simba won, and all was restored, and that beginning scene? This time, with Simba and Nala, we see it again, and thus ends the movie.""The Lion King"" is a terrific film. It had memorable scenes, good lessons, and nothing but Disney Magic. I've seen this in the movies in '94 and the re-release in '95, we had the video for some time, and this played on the Old Disney Channel in the late 90s. Go watch it; I think your life will change forever.10 out of 10"	10
 The greatest animated movie in history	"The concept might have not been unique in any way, but the animation and soundtrack changed all that. I mean, look at the way the movie began- ""The Circle of Life"". It does not get more majestic than that. Or when Simba was running through the desert back to the pride lands. Even the cast was excellent. Scar was as mean as he should have been. I have watched this movie over 50 times and still cannot get tired of watching it. And yea, Timon and Pumbaa, ever ready to give us the laughs the movie needed to complete the classic. Whoever thinks the movie is short of excellent should have his brain double checkedI think this movie is the best animated movie in history."	10
 One of the best Disney movies ever made!	I saw this movie twice in theaters when I was six years old and fell in love with it from the beginning. The characters, plot and songs have all influenced my life since then, and it's been about ten years, mind you! The only other movie I've been more obsessed with is Phantom of the Opera (yes, the 2004 version, 'tis wonderful!). I own LK on VHS, LK2 on VHS, LK #1 on DVD, and LK 1 1/2 on DVD. Simba is practically all I draw, and I made the school musical singing Can You Feel the Love Tonight last year. I saw the stage production in 2002, and it was amazing, it brought everything back for me. I felt like I was a little kid again, seeing everything, the colors, the music for the first time. My one issue: This is a classic. Why can't Disney make 'em like they used to?	10
 A ripped-off masterpiece		
 A great movie for all ages	The Lion King is a great movie for anyone to see.  It has suspense, drama, and will pull on anyone who has an open heart's emotional strings, so to speak.Anyone who has seen the movie and liked it would have to agree that it is definately one of the best animated movies ever.Basically without many details, The Lion King is about a young lion cub who is destined to become king, whether he likes it or not.  It will always remain a true masterpeice in my eyes.As far as Problems with the movie I see absolutely none.	10
 good, i really liked this	this is a really good animated film, which made me cry at the time.  the songs are lively and good and the plot is fun, if not touching.  this was the last good disney movie. i just wish that disney would stop making stupid sequels.  i give this 4 out of 5.  it's sequel was 2 out of 5.	
 Lion King, similar to Hamlet?	I would like to know if anyone else agrees with me.  Is THE LION KING similar to Shakespeare's HAMLET?  I think there are many striking resemblances.  The major one is that in HAMLET Claudius killed his brother, Hamlet's father, to become king.  In THE LION KING Scar kills Mufasa, Simba's father, to become king.  Of course that is not the only similarity. If you agree with me, let me know.	
 Disney's return to Grrreatness!	"The first Disney animated film with no human characters and to be based on an original story is an overwhelming success not only in the box office but as a movie. A lion cub, Simba, is next in line to be Lion King, until his evil uncle Scar, (voiced superbly villanously by Jeremy Irons) plots a coup agains the future king. Along the way we see Simba growing up and discovering the not so perfect world. A great story with a detailed plot that will have you engrossed. The songs are perfectly done, with Elton John singing the themes ""can you feel the love tonight?"" and ""Circle of life"".A classic that rivals any of Disney's older masterpieces. Followed by a good but less effective sequel. On a scale of one to ten..8"	8
 Now THIS is Disney at it's best!!!		10
 Rip off of a great older anime	This movie is a complete and shameless rip off with no credit given of the original Kimba the white lion made in Japan in the 50's or 60's that I remember seeing as a kid. While the animation is bright and the voice acting is bearable I cannot bear to see Disney continue to take credit for another's work	1
 Ambitious, but deeply flawed		5
 Okay...but massively overrated	"The Lion King is easily one of the most popular Disney movies out there and perhaps that's because it was very popular with kids at the time and those kids who have grown up now still consider it Disney's best. It is a visual treat which underlines themes of love and loss. But people call this the ""adult"" story of Disney and honestly, I find it to be one of the more childish entries in the Canon. Yes, Mufasa's death is pretty hard for a kids film but after that, the movie just continues with a very childish tone. Take Timon and Puumba, for example, who are thrown into the plot to remedy the movie from being too heavy-handed.The scene where they're looking up at the stars and make fun of Simba is rather disconcerting - they literally just laughed at him for speaking of his late father's wisdom. Really? In general, the story is weak and really loses itself after Mufasa's death. The characters also weren't as good as everyone says. Everyone claims Scar is the best Disney villain....but all he really did was kill his own brother, that's literally it. Why would he send his minions to kill Simba when he's knows how unreliable they are? And when he is in power, he's just lazy. How did Scar gain the title of best Disney villain? Timon and Puumba are also extraneous to the plot just to keep the kids demographic interested. But the worst is Simba and Nala. Not only are they both bland and boring but the romance between them is rather questionable considering they could be brother and sister (or at least cousins). The music is fine but it doesn't quite live up to the works of Alan Menken and Howard Ashmen in previous Disney movies. The only two songs I loved were The Circle of Life and Be Prepared. Other than that, the soundtrack is somewhat weak. I just can't wait to be King is frivolous and random to the plot, Hakuna Matata has some very stupid lyrics and a whole verse dedicated to a warthog's flatulence, Can You feel the love tonight is a very syrupy song which just doesn't work with its very weak lyrics - ""Why won't he be the king I know he is. The king I see inside"". The Lion King can't seem to keep up with its own maturity. The fart jokes, the bi-polar tone of being serious and silly, the questionable incest within the romance....it all just doesn't work for me. A highly overrated movie."	1
 Un\satisfying New Age Baloney		3
 Hands down the most overrated Disney film, and one of the top ten most overrated films ever		5
 How on earth did this get such high ratings? What has society come to?	"I'm sure I'll get many down votes on this review, seeing that so many people seem to think it's this amazing animated experience. Well, this is just my opinion, you can like it or leave it, to each their own and I only hope I never have to watch this thing ever again.I only ever saw The Lion King twice, both times were involuntary. The first time, I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and eating this nasty bright yellow popcorn. So, the movie began, and I nearly fell asleep sitting through the annoying intro music and strange ""lion birth ritual"" thing with this wizzled up monkey holding up a lion to the sun (by that point I was hoping the monkey would drop the lion off the cliff but sadly not all wishes come true). For the next little while there was some dopey singing that I'm surprised didn't give the whole audience brain damage, and this scene with these freaky drunk-looking hyenas (I was six, it freaked me the hell out back then). Next thing I know the father lion gets killed, which shocked all the kids in the audience, many parents carried their screaming and crying children out of the theater by that point, mine included. Thank you mom and dad, you saved my childhood.Recently my friend dragged me along to see it again at her house (she's a huge Disney fan, I'm more of an X-Files and Cold Case person). She kept on saying, ""isn't this a masterpiece? It's so breathtaking!"" and all I could do was try to block my mind of the two annoying singing animals (a pig and a squirrel-thing) who were on-screen singing this bizarre new-agey song thing and they adopted the baby lion, god knows why. Well, I told her exactly what I thought of The Lion King, and it involved many swear words. Her comeback to me was: ""You only hate it because it's Disney, you just don't understand its amazing moments!"" Alright, true, I'm not a big fan of Disney, I think it's a load of commercialized, always happy garbage that stupefies children. That being said, there are a few Disney films I didn't mind: Alice In Wonderland (the 1950's cartoon version), Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, The Beauty and The Beast, Monster's Inc., Toy Story, The Aristocats and Oliver & Company are the few Disney films I've seen and thought were okay.""You hate it because of the singing!"" was her next argument.Well yeah, the songs in this movie were terrible, that goes without saying. But it would be dumb to hate a movie based primarily on its soundtrack.""You hate it because it's popular!"" she said then.Harry Potter, Goosebumps, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, Cold Case, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Romero's Living Dead films, those films/TV shows are extremely popular and I love them! The Lion King is just stupid, plain and simple.""Okay, then you hate the actors,"" she concluded, looking unsure of herself at this point. (I just wanted to go home).I have nothing against the voice actors, they weren't bad (my all-time favorite actor, William B. Davis, has never been in any Disney movies, thank god).In my opinion, The Lion King was just a stupid movie and a waste of time, nobody has to agree with me. But I'd say it deserves 3/10 stars, definitely not the 8.5/10 stars it currently has."	3
 great songs in Shakespearian epic		6
 An example of everything I hate about Disney	I'm not a Disney convert. I didn't like what I saw of Disney movies as a kid and by the time THE LION KING came out in 1994 I was 13 and couldn't be less interested in kid's films anymore anyway. Decades later, I've finally watched it for the first time and the experience has reaffirmed all of the negativity I associate with Disney animation.This is over-simplistic, spoon-fed pulp for the masses. The story is copied from HAMLET and simplified to get rid of all the complexity. The characters are trite and one-dimensional without anything in the way of depth or motivation. Jeremy Irons' bad guy is that just because. The positive thing about this is that the character animation is very good indeed, although I found the backdrops simplistic in the extreme. The comedy relief is laboured and the songs trite. The whole experience washed over me without touching or involving me once, and don't get me started on the exaggerated voice acting.	4
 No bad, but it could be a lot better.	The Lion King isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have anything unique and the songs are annoying as hell. The story also has a ton of stuff that isn't explained. Why doesn't Scar kill young Simba after killing Mufassa. Why does Nala travel all the way to where Simba was living with Timon and Puamba. Why is there a drought, famine, and bad weather when Scar rules. There are like all these animals, so why don't they overthrow Scar. When Simba returns to face his actions, no one supports him until he finds out he didn't kill his father. Why does the land turn back to normal after Simba returns. This is probably the most overrated Disney film, but not the worst.	7
 A sweet joke	"I will admit whether they are original cartoons or CGI, Disney's G-Rated are typically nothing but lame ""sweet"" crap. The story was lame, and (even worse) the movie had terrible music through all of it. The Lion King is one Disney movie that I saw when it first came out, and it proved this very well in 1994. The whole movie is simply telling kids to be brave and do what you're told.The memories of having to watch this movie will simply give you nightmares. Just watch something like the original 60's ""Flintstones"" cartoons instead, they were much more entertaining than ""The Lion King""."	1
 Exhilarating highs--preachy, syrupy lows...	"Great-looking but preachy, ""uplifting"" Disney animated opus from an original story concerns a young jungle lion who has gone into a sort of self-imposed exile after blaming himself for his father's demise, soon befriended by two clowning creatures who help teach the cub about Life. Fine voice-work from Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones and Nathan Lane, many exciting and amusing moments, but nearly left sodden by a cloying, sugary song-score by Elton John and Tim Rice, with every tune underlining the ""message"" inherent in each sequence. Much of the talk is just Psychobabble 101, making the last fifteen or so minutes a chore to get through. The craftsmanship of the film's designers is really something to see, despite the fact the picture only won Oscars for its music (the score and the song, ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"", which sounds like a commercial jingle). **1/2 from ****"	6
 Another of the Disney greats		8
 Lion King Rocks!	Lion King is the BEST animated Disney movie ever made! I loved it when I first saw it and I still LOVE it! It is a very well-done movie with terrific characters, songs, and an AWESOME plot! Every time I watch Lion KIng, I have to watch it again. It has some funny moments but also some serious moments. It's not just a random little kid movie, there are some rough moments that aren't for very young kids, but it's still great all the same. The Lion King should definitely be added to anyone's movie collection, it will be a wonderful addition. It is a great movie for any time. Do you need a reason to watch the lion King??? NO! It's just a great movie! You are never to old for the Lion King! (I also recommend the sequel)	10
 one of my all time favourites	i remember going to the cinemas to see this when i was 3, its the first film i remember watching and i loved it then, and i still love it now. Johnathon Taylor Thomas puts up a great performance for the voice of young simba and when his father dies its his voice that makes me melt and cry (yes i do cry at this film!) It is brilliantly animated, the songs are great and the star studded cast (although you don't see them) are brilliant, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Hyena. Still today it remains one of my favourite films, i watch it all the time, mainly on sundays when there is nothing else on TV. I love this film...	10
 King of the nineties!		
 One of the best Disney in later years	"As usual has Disney made an outstanding film - tecnically speaking. Great animation are Disneys trademark and it shows!! The acting and music are also ""First Class"", especially Jeremy Irons (he is a wonderful singer). The story is one of the best in Disneys history - Its dealing with the problems of taking responsibility for ones actions in life and the pain of losing someone that you love. I would like to see that more often in Disneys movies...Unfortunately it is a ripoff of Tesuka Osamus ""Janguru Taitei aka Kimba The White Lion"" (there has been a lot of discussions about this so I'm not going to dig deeper into it) and that is a bit of a disgrace that they never admitted that (instead of threatening to sue those who pointed that out).Despite that, it is still one of the best Disneys, so it has my blessing ;)"	6
 Disney Has Forgotten		10
 Hakunnna!!!!	I don't have much to say here that others haven't, save that it was a great film and very fun to watch. Quite a spectacle, especially the wildebeast stampede that kills the father, the final battle, the humour of the Laurel and Hardy types Timon and Puumba, etc. The music is terrific too. No wonder this made 300M in '94, it should have been nominated for best film of the year too, Lord knows it was better than Forrest Gump.***1/2 outta ****	
 Love and courage	"When the film started, the music sounded, and the grand opening continued, and a sense of solemnity emerged. This is the opening of the most powerful animation I have ever seen.This movie is the most serious work produced by Disney Animation. It is an animated version of ""Hamlet"". It is a very meaningful animation that children and adults should watch with heart. Family, friendship, love, and affection are touching; equality, discrimination, slavery, resistance, and terrification; birth, death, happiness, sadness, and rebirth. Coupled with the perfect style of painting, highly infectious soundtrack, and the director's balance of seriousness and humor in the plot, it has become a milestone in the history of animation, the king of classics.I grew up watching Disney animation and grew up. In the future, I will also see bald heads and review every classic with grandchildren."	9
 One of the Most Iconic Movies of All Time	I have a hard time figuring out how I have managed to spend the first nineteen years of my life without seeing The Lion King. As a kid, I watched mostly Pixar and Dreamworks, which means my culture is lacking in the Disney classics department.Watching this film for the first time as an adult is a special experience : unlike a lot of people my age, it isn't a nostalgia adventure, which allows me to fully appreciate the craft behind this movie, from the leap-of-the-screen colors to the incredible voice acting to the powerful themes. The Lion King is just iconic from beginning to end.	8
 GOOD	Very good movie. i like i love it my kids love it evrybody loves it.	7
 A viscerally moving and inspiring tale that will echo through the ages		9
 Adventure film	What 3D reproductions and special screenings are actually just a means for Disney to return to the old film after 17 years	9
 Excellent and Enduring	"A breakthrough for Disney, this animated film is set in Africa and the main character is a prince instead of a princess, who is tricked into thinking he killed his father and flees into exile. The music is a collaboration between Elton John and Tim Rice and yielded, among other good songs, ""Circle of Life."""	9
 The lion King	The Lion King is a great film. Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. A++	9
 nice	The film is such a heart-warming story. The movie is about a young lion named simba, who is tricked into thinking he is responsible for his father's death, and then leaves the pride with guilt and goes off on his own. He grows up alone, but on the way he meets a lifelong friend who has its funny moments, its action, and it's really the perfect movie for kids. For adults, the acting was great, the story was good, and it was predictable, but not when I was a kid. So it's a warm movie	8
 It's my childhood	"""The lion king"" is a film that can accompany people to grow up, it brings people moved, the aftertaste is deep and long. The first time I saw it as a child, I cried twice. Once was mufasa's death, simba's desperate cry, and once was simba's standing on the rock of glory at the end of the film, and everything came back to life. Of course, I may have been fascinated by those vivid images when I was a child. However, as I grew older and reviewed for many times, I found that the lion king not only brought me rich sound and color, but also deeply shocked my soul. The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue."	9
 One of the best animated films of all time		10

 A classics	The classics are called classics because he ca n't copy them. The Lion King is such a classic. Every detail is so good, every music is so beautiful, just funny and consistent. This kind of film will not fall behind no matter when it is put in, because he is a legend	10
 Good	It have been released for twenty years,I don't know how many times I have seen it. Every character is portrayed in a profound way. Even now, the grand picture and shocking music are still in my mind when simba was born.	8
 One of the kings of animation	"""The Lion King"" is one of the greatest animated films ever made thanks to many important elements. First of all the characters are memorable even if they appear for a short time. Then the plot is interesting and it is about the circle of life: life and death but also generosity opposed to selfishness. All of this is possible through an impeccable animation and a great music (both the score and the original songs). I think that almost everyone has watched it at least once, if not where had you lived? Jokes aside, ""The Lion King"" has been a cultural phenomenon for a reason, it's very very good."	9
 The Lion King	Twenty five years ago, the cartoon was already a classic, and the musical version reached a new high. I didn't expect that CG version could make new ideas and surprises. On the one hand, technology is invincible. It glorifies the beauty of the mainland and the liveliness of all kinds of animals. As soon as Little Simba comes out, the girls behind him all make a cute voice. But more importantly, from the beginning of circle of life, to the death of Mufasa, and then to the final war, even though the whole story has been familiar to the heart, the mood can still be mobilized from the beginning to the end.	9
 simba	"The Lion King"" describes the life of the animal kingdom in the African savannah. In fact, its theme transcends any culture and national boundary, and has a profound connotation-the reincarnation of life, the ups and downs of all things, and everything must follow the laws of nature. It is also a warm work that explores love, responsibility and learning in life. The film is filled with a strong musical atmosphere and successfully created the vitality of nature. ""Lion King"", it shows us a new and magnificent world, let us experience the life touched by love and adventure. It also uses bright colors, moving music, exaggerated forms, humorous and witty language and humanized movements to make Simba, Nana, Mufasa, Ximan, Peng Peng and Scar, Coyote The story is inspired by epic grand scenes and meaningful interpretations in the film, which leads to the philosophical thinking of the ultimate problems such as the reincarnation of life and death, the transfer of wisdom and so on."	8
 The lion king-animated version roars	The lion king represented a slew of blockbusters for Disney studios back in the 1990s. A lot people like this beloved 2d animated classic. The songs are so strong that they even have a sing along for this movie. I miss Alan manken and Howard ashman. They were good songwriters. The story is about a lion cub named simba played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas (young simba) and Matthew Broderick(grown up simba) who one day will rule his lands but in order to do he must respect, obey and be responsible to his father Mufasa. His uncle scar voiced by Jeremy irons is a wrongful and evilly valiant lion. Pumba and tamone are the perfect comic relief for a Disney film. There come up with two words Hakuna Matata which means no worries. Simba gets introduced to them when he runs away from home and his father dies after a wild animal stampede. Simbas love interest is nala. Nala is a young female lion. This movie has some intense scenes that are sometimes scary for the little ones. The movie appeals to the boys and girls that are ages 8 and up. All in all the lion king is superbly entertaining film and is brilliantly filled with breathtaking animation	10
 The lion king	The story of courage and growth, even after many years, even in different stages of life, still let people in the watching some gains. Simba is in the twists and turns of life out of the road to king.This is the classic	9
 the Lion king	"The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue. The reason why this is a film with the growth of people, because from the film we can see their own growth. Just like the protagonist simba, he was carefree, naughty and brave in his youth, and sang ""I will be lion king"" with his head held high."	9
 In my opinion, one of Disney's best movies	"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid and completely falling in love with it. Even now, as I'm 20 years old, this movie touches me in a way very few movies do. The movie takes you through the journey of a young lion to adulthood, the royal throne, the lessons he learns throughout his journey and the different situations that he goes through that ultimately makes him a better person (I guess you could say 'lion' here). What I love about this movie (and what I subconsciously loved about it as a kid) is how much this movies teaches us. This movie is filled with moral lessons (""Hakuna Matata"" for example) that we can all, no matter our age, learn from and relate to."	9
 great		9
 Thank God, then, for The Lion King.	"Simba always knew that he was going to succeed his father, Mufasa, as the next Lion KingThis is one of my precious childhood memories.""The place where the sun can shine is our land."" Whenever you look at it anytime, anywhere, you will be moved by the classics."	9
 2D animated Movie King for all ages	I love it when I was kid, I love it when I was teen, I love it now and my kid love it too. Moral full story based 2D animated movie indeed. A must for kids.	10
 Great for those with some time to spare	Excellent film for when you are just lion about. Another classic feature of this visual treat is the lack of lion. Most characters are honest which is excellent for the young viewers especially those who are getting into a habit of lion a lot.	8
 Father's love	Simms is the little prince of the Lion Kingdom, and his father Mufasa is a majestic king.However, Uncle Scar has long coveted Mufasa's throne.To sit on the throne, the scar must remove the little prince, so the scar used various excuses to let Simba go out, and then waited for the opportunity to open the killing ring, but Mufasa was rescued immediately. After repeated calculations, Mufasa died tragically under the scar, and the scar ulteriorly persuaded Simba to leave. On the one hand, he was sent to kill him.During Simba's escape, he met the witty Ding Man and the kind PengPeng . They raised Simba into a majestic lion and encouraged him to go back to the forest to restore his country. In the next battle to restore the county and save the people, Simba really grew up to be a strong man and understood the true meaning of responsibility.From the beginning, Simba made a mistake and only talked to it with a long-term focus instead of really teaching him. It can be seen that it is really a treasure in the plan. Later, Simba didn't live up to his fathers expectations and developed the Glory Kingdom.This story is a story about the reincarnation of life and the rise and fall of all things; it is a story about love, growth and self-redemption, and its connection is profound and powerful. In the vast and prosperous African savannah, all things endlessly, the birth of a life slowly opened the curtain of the drama, brush but soothing, rich and fresh. The fragrance of flowers and trees and the atmosphere of earth will bring the audience to this magical country.The film contains some music that makes people feel relaxed and the whole film is very touching. We are like little lions, and our parents are like lions.	8
 The lion king	A classic is a classic because it can't be copied. The lion king is such a classic. Every detail is so wonderful.	9
 like	The film brought me the greatest insight: growing up to meet everyone is worthy of thanks. Because of their appearance, let you know the world more comprehensively; because of their appearance, make your growth more solid. Old king mufasa made simba understand the need to be brave is meaningful, wild boar pumbaa and mongoose Timon let simba feel the beauty of life, baboon elders told simba the meaning of life is to assume due responsibility.And the appearance of scar, let Simba realize that the world is not only sunshine and good, but also darkness and evil.	9
" 'I can't marry her... she's my friend..."""		7
 Classic animated movies	Childhood memories, forever classics. Now it's also very meaningful	9
 A story of growth and responsibility	"In the history of animation, ""The Lion King"" can be called an epic masterpiece, and everything it brings to me is unforgettable and negligible. Simba, he met a friendship between the two. Through hard work, with the help of himself and his friends, Simba finally defeated his uncle and the animal that became the king.This movie teaches me that a friend in need is a true friend, and his goal can only be achieved through unremitting efforts."	9
 Lions	Great movie. Great sounds track and some very realistic fight scenes	10
 Touching	This is a film full of memories, to see it again will still be shocked.This is about growth, responsibility of the story, full of the power of justice, a happy ending, people still moved!	9
 awesome and betiful movie.	A brilliant addition to Disney's library, combined with the direction, screenplay, vocal performances, score, songs, editing, action sequences and animation,	8
 !	Nice (doing it for profile checkout)Should watch though	9
 enjoyable	The lion king is my favorite cartoon the script is so excellent during watching this movie i have fell into the ocean of joy	10
 good	The story of courage and growth, even after many years, even in different times, can still make people feel love.	9
 Definitely a classic!	Movies now a days are not made with the same authenticity like the ones created in the age of Lion King. i love it!	
 My number 1 favorite Disney movie of all time	This is the Greatest Movie I have ever seen, the Animation is Stunning, the Songs are Beautifully Sung with Well Done Lyrics, The Story is Well Written with a lot of Heart and Soul and has a Very Encouraging Moral and It has some of the Most Lovable, Well Made and Relatable Characters I have ever seen, There is Literally without a doubt, nothing wrong with the Film, it is in My Opinion Absolutely Perfect, If you haven't seen, Go Check it out it is Definitely Worth a Watch.	10
 The Lion King, Disney's most wondrous creation	The Lion King is one of Disney's most classic films because it truly will warm your heart. Characters you can fall in love with or fall in anger with. You will get emotional watching this movie because of how invested you get with the storyline and characters. The Lion King covers love, friendship, family, death and triumph. This movie has a great soundtrack as well as good animation. Definitely a movie both kids and adults will love to see. I watched it when I was young and loved it, The Lion King, Disney's most wondrous creation.	10
 Amazing	The story of courage and growth, even after many years, even in different times, I am still touched, Simba is in countless setbacks to becoming the king. Hakuna Matata!!!	9
 beautiful movie	After seeing the new lion king movie, I also wanted to remind myself the older one.. Both are great, but the older is simple unbeatable...	10
 Best Inspirational Cartoon	This classic Disney animation was obviously shown to children. Each voice actor's lines are as clear and clear as possible, and the sentences are relatively simple and educational.There is really nothing to say about such an animated film. Good places, we will be moved no matter how many times we watch. Simba's affection, love, friendship. The three most precious feelings in life are clearly recounted through the story of the lion. Although it is an animated film, education is still the first.	10
 Remember who you are	My favorite character is Mufasa,I've never seen such pure fatherly love. Motherly love is often seen in movies. I was touched by Mufasa's love forSimba. He was an honorable father.	9
 A classic educational also growing movie, which is suitable for anybody.	The Lion King is one of the most popular creations of the Walt Disney Studios.From year and year, people could really receive the energy from this movie.The story between Mufasa and his son Simba has touched a lot of people around the world.It's a movie which is educational not only for parents,but also for kids.They can learn the firm spirit from this great movie.I will watch it again and again.	10
 To see or not to see: that's an easy question.	Reviewing this movie isn't too challenging for me, what this movie does is really a matter of ticking all the boxes:The epic sense of place, the formidable scenery and landscape that actually feels more real than real footage, the exoticism, the unforgettable songs, each grandiosely staged, the charismatic villain and of course our comic relief double act.A part of me always feels a little bit cheated by the outsourcing of most of the humor to the comic relief characters rather than simply writing a protagonist with a bit more personality but the whole comes together very well so I can't complain.	8
 In life, we can learn one or two things, and The Lion King is a great sample of it...	The Lion King movie is known to be more funny and also have sadness to it. One family who rule the area while one of its member tend to break from the family bond.Ever since we live in this world, there's always going to be happy and sadness upon us. This movie is great that it teaches a kid to know what is right from wrong. Just as Mufasa and Scar.Two brothers, one to be more humble and kind... while other one is totally diffrerent.This will be greatest movie of all time whether you're young or older, there's so much we can all learned from this amazing movie.	10
 somewhat dark but still great	Love how they came up with this but as I got older an watched it again I realised how dark this was	9
 An All Time Classic	Pros:GREAT songsGREAT charactersGREAT storylineEmotionally Powerful ScenesBEAUTIFUL animationGREAT voice actingCons:A few unnecessary scenes	9
 Why they even need to re-shoot it!	I was a little girl when I saw this movie for the first time. I had not remember it completly actually, just some misty visions were on my mind. Whenever I heart its name I was crying in the cause of it's sad beginning. But now I have lost my father and Simba's father reminds me mine. I just want to stay and face with my demons. So consequently I would say this movie is just not a child movie, no it is more than that, it is a warm story that filled with very wise advices.	9
 Fantastic	One of the best Disney movies of all time. It has comedy, drama, and suspense. I loved it as a child and enjoy showing it to my children and grandchildren. It will be a classic for years to come.	10
 the lion king	Wow what a disgrace a live action film was to this masterpiece,when i watched this film as a kid it was my favourite one and today it is same situation and lion king is the best animated film ever at least in my opinion there are plenty of great ones like aladdin,beauty and beast,toy story franchise and japanese one mononoke,spirited away...but only this one was able to hit me deep and hard and i felt something that i thought it doesnt exist in me,animation is brilliant here and it is top quality still today,also voice actors expecely james earl jones and jeremy irons did a wonderful jobs in it but lets not also forger broderick,atkinson and woopi who were also impressive,the lion king is masterpiece of animation and storytelling mixed with some life changing messages and lessons,go watch this right now and lets pretend that live action film never happened	10
 The Lion King review	"Well, I have to hand it to this movie's marketing team. Everything we got in trailers and promotions perfectly encapsulated Jon Favreau's ""reimagining"" of one of the most acclaimed and successful animated films of all time. None of the characters in the trailers showed any tinge of emotion on their faces, and all of the clips were from scenes directly lifted from the original. That's what we were shown, and that's what 2019's The Lion King is. So it's really on us for giving it money and sitting in that theater for two hours. We're giving Disney our energy, and they've caught on that they don't need to deliver much on the product when we do.So, as exemplified by their latest ""reimagining,"" ""new take,"" ""reworking,"" whatever they want to call it to avoid the largely negative connotations that come with ""remake,"" they simply aren't trying.The computer animation in Favreau's Lion King is impressive on a technical level, but it has no life or personality to it. Of course it's not really ""live-action"" like some have called it for simplicity's sake, but it's as close as they could get with a story like this. Here's the thing, though: the medium can't work for this story. True stylized animation was always the best fit for it, and it's a large part of what gave the original its sense of wonder and grandeur. So it doesn't translate into photorealistic imagery to begin with, but even the new form of animation is done to a subpar level. The designs, movement, and environments all look real, but that's not strictly what people want to see in a Disney film. The characters rarely, if ever, visibly react to even the most tragic events, and it makes it hard to care even if we've connected to this story through the 1994 film. Sarabi doesn't look sad at all when she learns her mate has died and her son is presumed dead, nor does she even have any visual distinction from the other lionesses. That includes Nala, whose role is slightly expanded in this version, but not in a way that actually feels bigger than her role in the animated film. Beyoncé gives a good performance, as do most of the voice actors (Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, though not enough to make the movie feel like it has a personality), but the star power feels wasted on such dull designs. You can tell there's emotion behind the microphone, but none of it comes across visually, and unfortunately for this movie, it's a visual medium.Sequences like ""Circle of Life,"" ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King,"" and Mufasa's famous appearance from beyond the grave, all of which were visually distinct and even stunning in the original, are devoid of their predecessors' energy, color, and creativity. The latter especially. I won't say specifically what they do with the scene, which is perhaps one of the most iconic in Disney history, but it might be one of the biggest disservices any of these Disney remakes have done to their source material, and it presents an astounding lack of effort. And this is in a huge production from one of the biggest behemoths in the industry. I don't know how they could screw it up so badly with such advanced technology and a budget of $260 million, but it's a gargantuan letdown.The movie puts so little effort into basic setup and payoff that it feels condescending, like Jon Favreau and Jeff Nathanson are directly looking through the camera at the audience and saying, ""We know you're only seeing this because you love the original, so we're not going to bother making it worthwhile."" Major themes and emblems of the 1994 film are pulled out suddenly in the third act for the sake of resembling something beloved, without being properly built up at any other point in the movie. Nathanson's script adds a few lines of backstory for Scar and the hyenas, but it doesn't feel like it truly adds anything to the original story, nor does it make this one make any more sense. Plot points lifted from the 1994 script by Irene Mecchi, Linda Woolverton, and Jonathan Roberts are awkwardly executed or rushed simply so the crew behind the remake can say they kept them, including Simba's entire character arc and romance with Nala, and Scar's plot to kill Mufasa and take over the pride. Sometimes it feels jarring, other times it drudges along, and others it just gets confusing. Some lines of dialogue lifted from the original script are rearranged and worked around unnecessary pauses, making their respective scenes feel stilted. And once again, the utter lack of emotion on the characters in literally any given scene doesn't help.The Lion King may not be quite as bad as Guy Ritchie's Aladdin or Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, but pretty much everything good about it (the overall plot, the music, James Earl Jones) was taken from the original, so it can't even claim credit for any of it. It's awkwardly paced, blandly edited, visually dull in every aspect, and does nothing narratively to justify its existence. It may not technically be a shot-for-shot remake like some were speculating from the trailers, but there's nothing different in it that makes it worth the time. Make no mistake: it's the movie you love with all of its emotion and imagination stripped away. That's what the Disney remakes have been doing more and more in the past few years. Maybe they were hit and miss once, but now we're steadily seeing less and less effort put into them, and that's in large part because we continue to see them. And if they already have our money before these movies are released, why even bother to give us what we paid for?"	9
 My childhood Favorite.	Ignore the remake, watch this one Instead..	10
 The Lion King review	"""The Lion King"" is an incredible movie. I first saw ""The Lion King"" in the hazy days of 2003, and it left a lasting impression on me. I waited years to acquire my own copy of the film and revisit it, and it was well-worth the wait. So, why is ""The Lion King"" so awesome? Besides the near flawless 2-D and 3-D animation, and the spectacular soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, ""The Lion King"" feels well and truly unique, inventive and ambitious in the canon, being a cross between ""Hamlet"" and ""Bambi"" with lions in the Savannah. The Disney Renaissance formula is present in this movie, but it only ever adds to it and never makes the movie feel generic or predictable like it did with ""Aladdin"". When you think about it, ""The Lion King's"" story is actually pretty simple and basic: a prince is born to a good king, the jealous brother of the good king murders him to seize power and banishes the prince, the prince lives in shame for years until his friends find him in exile and convince him to come home, the prince fights his uncle for his birthright. And having a basic plot isn't always a good thing because it often equals a thin plot, but in ""The Lion King's"" case it works incredibly well in the movie's favor, because it gives the filmmakers all the time and space they need to give the movie everything in every department.More than that though, a large part of the reason why ""The Lion King"" packs so much power is because there are actual, lasting consequences to everything that happens. ""The Lion King"" is one of a very small number of films in the Disney canon where good, supporting characters are actually allowed to die (others include ""Bambi"", ""Tarzan"", ""Brother Bear"", and ""Big Hero 6""), and unlike the death of Bambi's mother (which was quietly swept under the rug and ignored by the narrative for sixty odd years), Mufasa's death has weight. It represents the point in the movie where literally everything goes wrong. The villain, Scar, actually succeeds in getting what he wanted for longer than five minutes, and even after he's defeated in the end, it still doesn't bring Mufasa back or undo the years of suffering he dealt upon everyone in the Pridelands, Simba especially. The Pridelanders can only tend to their wounds and try to move on with their lives. The sense of spirituality running through ""The Lion King"", while a bit on the nose at times, is honestly so rich and works so well with the setting of the movie. After the injustice of Mufasa's murder and the cruelty of Scar's leadership, a terrible draught falls upon the Pridelands during his reign. When Simba and Scar fight for the title of king, they fight with the cleansing fires of hell itself surrounding them, and when the rightful balance is finally restored with the divine prince back in power, the weather relents and the rains return to the Pridelands. It's obvious symbolism, but still good symbolism.The Lion King Simba and NalaSimba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is a spunky, carefree young lion prince. When he's not romping around the Pridelands, playing with his best friend Nala, he really looks up to his dad, Mufasa, and his uncle, Scar, and eagerly awaits his time as king of Pridelands. Simba is quite frankly a little brat. He lies to his parents, mistreats his guardian, Zazu, puts himself and Nala in grave danger and really only wants to be king for shallow, narcissistic reasons. It's clear Mufasa has been too soft on him. It's hard to hold this against Simba though, because one, he's really only a small boy who doesn't know any better for the most part; two, Simba growing out of this childish notion of what being a king and an adult means is an important part of his character arc and is meant to contrast with his evil, manchild uncle, who never does the same; and three, anyone who's ever seen ""The Lion King"" knows real life is going to hit Simba hard soon and he's gotta enjoy that blissful innocence while he has it. Despite being a chronic troublemaker, the one thing Simba hates is disappointing his dad, because Mufasa isn't just his father, he's also the boy's hero. Perhaps I spoke too soon when I said the Beast and his servants have the most messed-up backstory in the Disney canon, because Simba's backstory is also extremely dark. Scar arranges for Mufasa to be brutally killed in a stampede and afterwards he blames it all on Simba, because he hates him with a passion. The guilt that would come from thinking you got your own beloved father trampled to death would warp and crush an adult man, think of what it would do to someone who looks to be the lion equivalent of eight. And Simba spends most of his life living with this shame (Matthew Broderick takes on the role of Simba for the second half of the film).After meeting some drifters, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba takes their well-meaning but ultimately unhelpful advice of burying his guilt, his doubts and his trauma and turning his back on his past. But by doing so, he also turns his back on his people for years when they need him the most. What's more, Timon and Pumbaa's advice still doesn't fully work, he's still haunted by his memory of his father even into adulthood. With a coup against the tyrant Scar starting up, Simba is faced with the choice of remaining a troubled hippie without purpose forever, or going home and doing what's right for his friends and family, even if it ends badly for him - facing his own demons as well as the ones Scar crafted for him. After some stern talkings-to, Simba does the latter of course, and by doing so and fighting his uncle, he proves himself worthy of being a king - as well as finally getting some justice when he learns his uncle set him up. Having conquered his demons for the time being, put his mind mostly at ease and been accepted again by his family, Simba brings his friends with him to his new life and brings peace and virility back to the Pridelands. Later installments of ""The Lion King"" franchise reveal that Simba would still have some leftover PTSD and some major trust issues, which is to be expected. Trauma like Simba's doesn't heal overnight, but it doesn't have to consume your entire life either. It's not uncommon for Disney coming-of-age stories to end with the protagonist having kids and continuing that circle of life (""Bambi"" laid down the template), but I think Simba's case is the most satisfying. After everything he had to endure and everything he overcame, it's great to see Simba eventually emerge with a loving mate, great friends, and two wonderful cubs (dat adorable Kiara cameo at the end).Prince Scar is a villain that you seriously love to hate. Scar, at first glance, seems pretty similar to Jafar from ""Aladdin"". Jeremy Irons chews plenty of scenery as Scar. His dry, sarcastic performance as the immature, compulsively lying royal feline - who spends his days lazing around the den, antagonizing his big brother and the help - calls to mind memories of the scheming vizier from the last film. But ""Be Prepared"" makes it clear Scar is an even more vicious, loathsome and dangerous character than Jafar was - driven by envy, hatred and an ungratefully privileged mindset. A subtle but fundamental difference between the two is that Jafar stole power and status because he wanted it, while Scar feels he's owed it, he's entitled to it, that it's his birthright, and the latter is a much more personal and vindictive feeling. Scar has spent years stewing in quiet, passive-aggressive jealousy and resentment towards his older brother, Mufasa, and his family, and now that he has nothing left to lose (he's never going to rule now that Mufasa has sired an heir) he's decided he's just going to try to get rid of them all. Like Frollo from ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", Scar is one of the more disturbing Disney villains because he lacks a magical fantasy element, and he's the sort of evil that can actually exist in the real world. Sometimes people who are mentally unstable bottle up their feelings in an unhealthy fashion for years or even decades until they just snap, and that's one of many ways that you can get murderers. Underneath a seemingly calm, droll and apathetic exterior, Scar has a festering vindictive and sadistic streak, aimed at the people around him, that's first hinted at when we're introduced to him 'playing with his food'.He doesn't just want Mufasa and Simba to die, he hates them so much he wants them to suffer before they do. He stabs Mufasa through the paws and lets him know full well he's betraying him before he throws his brother to his death. He pins Mufasa's murder on Simba and sends the cub away before sending the hyenas after him, because he wants him to die thinking he killed his father. He later attempts the same thing by 'secretly' telling Simba he killed Mufasa before he tries to do him in. Basically, Simba and Mufasa were extremely unlucky to have a psychopath in their family that they trusted. Like cub Simba though, Scar has a narrow and immature idea of what to do with power once he gets it. Since he only ever wanted to be a king for the title, he never bothered learning what it actually entails and the responsibilities that come with the position, causing the tribe as a whole to suffer, but his pride and spitefulness forbids him from correcting his course once it all goes wrong. He drags the Pridelands to ruin (which should give you an idea of how Ursula and Jafar's respective reigns would have gone, if they hadn't been immediately dealt with) and his already tenuous sanity takes a large hit as he's subsequently haunted by the memory of his brother. Lastly, I like how much of a complete and utter bad this lion is, with no redeeming qualities to him besides his trademark wit. He does everything he possibly can to make you hate him, and when his two biggest flaws (his vindictive streak and two-faced nature) finally catch up to him, he gets one of the most satisfying Disney villain deaths ever. He couldn'"	9

 One of my Favorite Father-Son related movie	Around the world, there are rare attempts made on showing a father-son relation. This film will always stay on top of my list when it comes to that. Very emotional and touching film. It can be watched with all ages except toddlers.Without a doubt worth watching film.	9
 'Remember who you are'	After watching the remake of The Lion King (2019) from Disney it encouraged me to come back to the original version and leave my very first review. I am one of the many people who first saw this film as a child and then technically saw it numerous times as I grew older. Watching the film again after so long helped me see it from an adult point of view and I explain below why it is one of the best Disney films ever made.Where should I start? One of Disney's original story not based from a fairy tale. The depiction of the amazing landscape of the African savanna and the diverse wildlife it contains. The use of African music in songs with meaningful and symbolic lyrics. Inspiring and captivating characters along with a story-line full of humor, suspense, emotions and educational messages. These messages are embedded in children's minds unconsciously. As an adult though, I can know go deeper and critically think what the film is trying to teach to all of us, both children and adults. Messages about friendship, love and family, but also, deeper concepts from a sociological and political perspective.The Lion King teaches us first of all the value of mother nature and all the resources that it provides to us. As living beings on this planet we have rights and responsibilities towards this land by utilising with respect and sustainability these resources. In the film Mufasa explains this clearly as part of his lesson to his son and future King, Simba. Also, the film is a great example of illustrating 'good' leadership' in comparison to just being a King. Although monarchy is a conventional concept, Mufasa and his kingdom can be used as a metaphor of how any kind of leader should act and the principles and qualities they must carry. Being a leader involves responsibility and respect towards your people, the land and of course yourself. It is about maintaining balance in nature. A perfect way to educate young people about sustainability not only for the environment but also sustainability for societies. The biggest issues that our world is facing is because of greediness and the inability to equally distribute resources that a fare and justice for all. An example of this can be observed in the film when Scar takes over the kingdom and he has consumed most of the lands resources too fast resulting to having not enough food. Also, whatever food was available he was the only one to have access to it. No social justice in the distribution of the resources.Lastly, I would like to also mention the beautiful son and father relationship the movie presents. The way Simba is learning from his father, the love he has towards him and of course the pain of his father's lost is something that most of us will relate to. Even the fact that he is not always physically present in Simba's life he still has a huge influence in the decisions Simba makes. 'Remember who you are' is my favourite line from the movie because it shows how easily we as humans forget who we are and what our rights and responsibilities are towards nature, society and of course, towards ourselves.I hope you all enjoyed the film and saw the deeper messages the way I did. 'Hakuna Matata'.	9

 The Lion King	"This Disney animated favourite was a big box office hit, it spawned a successful worldwide stage musical, and got a photorealistic remake twenty-five years later, the original remains a crowd-pleasing cartoon. Basically, in the Pride Lands of Africa, at Pride Rock, the lions rule over the animal kingdom. There Simba, the new-born son of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (Madge Sinclair), is being presented to the large gathering of animals by Rafiki the mandrill (Robert Guillaume), the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) the Pride Lands, explaining his responsibilities as king, and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba to become king himself. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris), who are betrothed, into exploring the forbidden land. In the elephant graveyard, the lion cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings), who are in league with Scar. Mufasa rescues them after being alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Mufasa is upset with Simba, but forgives him, he tells him the great kings of the past are in the night sky, they will always be there to guide him, as he will be one day. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge, while a stampede of wildebeest is driven by the hyenas to trample him. He informs Mufasa, who saves Simba but hangs perilously trying to climb out of the gorge. Scar refuses to save him and causes him to fall onto the stampeding herd. Simba finds Mufasa dead, Scar convinces him that this tragedy is his fault, and tells him to run away and never return. The hyenas are ordered to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride about the deaths of Mufasa and Simba, appoints himself as king, and allows the hyenas to live in Pride Rock. Simba has collapsed in the desert, he is rescued by friends and outcasts Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). They take pity on him, telling him to put his past behind him, citing their motto ""Hakuna Matata"", meaning ""no worries"". Timon and Pumbaa allow him to live in their jungle paradise. Simba (Matthew Broderick) grows up as a carefree adult. Meanwhile the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scar's rule. Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", when a hungry adult lioness tries to attack them. Simba fights her, but realises it is Nala (Moira Kelly) grown up. She and Simba reunite and fall in love. She urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have been destroyed, feeling guilty for his father's death he refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who discovered he was still alive, he tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, following this he decides to return home. Aided by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba sneaks past the hyenas and confronts Scar. He taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, there he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to tell the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fight against the hyenas, Scar tries to escape, until he is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Simba spares his life but orders him to leave and never return. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, the rain starts to fall, the other animals watch as Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and roars to announce his kingship. Later, Pride Rock is restored to its usual state, animals are gathered as King Simba and Queen Nala look over their kingdom, and Rafiki presents their new-born cub. Also starring Zoe Leader as Sarafina, Frank Welker as Lion Roars, Tony Jay as Hyenas, and B.J. Ward as Lions. The voice cast are all terrific, especially Jones as the father and Irons as the villain, the colourful animation is wonderful, the story inspired by biblical stories and Shakespeare's Hamlet is good, it makes you laugh and cry, and the songs composed by Sir Elton John and written by Sir Tim Rice are memorable anthems, a most satisfactory animated musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, and Best Song for ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Circle of Life"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Song for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score - Motion Picture. It was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was number 94 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"	9
 The best Disney ever	A masterpiece! Best music, and beautiful animation!	10

 Most legendary movie ever!!	The Lion King is one of the most beautiful, inspiring, majestic movies of all time! The story is amazing about redemption and love, Hans Zimmer made this movie a historic phenomenon with his magic, the voices for each voice was perfectly picked and I'm so glad Lions were the animals picked for the movie because they are the most majestic animals on Earth!	10
 The greatest Disney movie ever	The greatest Disney movie ever. Can't wait for the remake I'm just hoping it'll be as good as the original.	10
 The best childhood film from the 90s	The Lion King has been my favorite movie since I was a child and I would highly recommend this movie to all kids!! I mean its the lion king!	9
 Amazing	This is one of the best cartoon creation and one of the best story's I remember.	10
 The Lion King (1994)	This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies. The animation is top notch and flawless. This film also features superb work from the vocal cast James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg. This is a standout.	9
 A big part off my childhood	There is no Disney movie that can compare to The Lion King, Is the perfect animated film that just never gets old every time I watch it. It's characters are all animals but they are covered with so much depth that you care about each one off them, except off course Scar he is a prick but great villain anyways. If you want your childhood back then please watch this movie, cause its a brilliant masterpiece.	10
 Good story	I finally watched this movie today and it was a good animated movie with so much tension and dramatic moments which you never really see in animated movies today. I'm not a fan of musicals, but the songs in the movie were ok, the one with the pig and meerkat was pointless and didn't fit in the story. It was still a good movie which teaches some important lessons which children movies should.	8
" ""What do you want me to do, dress in drag and do the hula?"""	"""The Lion King"" is one of the best known and most respected Disney movies. On IMDb it's in top 50, Metascore 83, 93% on Rotten Tomatoes... I don't know... it seems a bit too much to me. The film is very good and I do not have any specific objections, but it did not delight me. To animated characters voices are lent by the pretty powerful cast, which includes Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones, Cheech Marin, and others, and several songs from the movie were deservedly nominated for an Oscar, from which one won it. Still, from today's perspective, I would rate it seven, but when it came out, and I was a kid, I was thrilled, and for 1994, it has an enviable animation, so I will give it a compromise eight.8/10"	8
 Growingytartist's review of THE LION KING	Story (9/10):The overall story was really good. Some moments, like Mufasa's death scene and the scene before Simba returns to Pride Rock, are amazing. However, I sort of wish that there was slightly less focus on trying to appeal to the children (with their childish jokes) but the great moments overall outshine this.Characters (8/10):I love most of the characters. Scar, once he gets Pride Rock, can get a little too over dramatic based on the premise of his characterization in the beginning of the film. Some of the other characters (Timon, Pumba, the hyenas) can sometimes go a LITTLE over the top, but to some extent it is reasoned out (for example, most antics of the hyenas is because they are not that intelligent) and maintain that energy throughout the movie.Music: 10/10Do I even NEED to go further?Animation: 10/10Honestly, The Lion King holds up today. You can tell the animators spent a lot of time on this project, and it shows. The colors, the style, the timing are all amazing.Overall (9/10):The overall movie is something that I would recommend everyone to see. It's animation and music are beautiful. If the side characters were toned down a little more, I would give it a 10/10. I understand that the movie is supposed to appeal to both children AND adults, but this is my personal opinion at this time. THank you so much for reading this!	9
 Amazing Movie		10
 Always a classic	Classic and timeless movie. Love watching it with my nephews now.	10
 Hamlet with African Animals	"**MY FIRST IMDB REVIEW WITH SPOILERS**The Lion King is a fantastic masterpiece from Walt Disney. It's similar to William Shakespeare's play ""Hamlet"", the characters are well-developed, & of course...Mufasa's death is a tearjerker!!OVERALL: 10/10"	10
 An All Time Classic	This film will forever hold a special place in my heart. It was one of the first movies I watched were I was confronted with death. To this day this movie still pulls at my heart strings and cannot help but cry every time I watch it. It is one of Disney's best animated movies and has an amazing musical soundtrack. This movie will continue to be passed around for all generations to come. If you have not seen this movie, whether your a child or adult, I highly recommend you fix that as soon as possible. You will not be disappointed but instead will want relive the experience and share it with your friends and family.	9
 A Great Movie	They family-orientated movies! it's one of my favorites	8
 Beautiful classic	I do connect with my childhood when I watch this but I'm looking forward to seeing the remake. In hindsight I think I mostly enjoyed it for the soundtrack	8
 Great!	This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old, I usually don't care for animated movies but this film is the real deal, this is one of disney's best animated movies.	9
 THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!	I love this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	10
 My all time favourite!	I love this movie! I've grown upcwith this, I watched a 1000 times then and still watch it now!The only thing I don't get is that they cast different singing voice actors. Only Scarvand Zazu have the same voices when they sing and talk.	10
 Go along on this journey of life with Simba- you won't regret	"Perhaps it is nostalgia that makes me cherish The Lion King more than its worth, but this is the best animated movie =, at least for me. Based on Shakespeare's Hamlet and set in the African savannah The Lion King is a touching tale of redemption, love and destiny. The voice actors are spot on, especially the sinister Jeremy Irons who voices the ""bad guy"" Scar and the film is filled with emotional ups and downs sure to affect not just the younger audience but also their elders. The musical numbers are all fantastic. It is a testimony to the power of this movie that even to this day it is fondly remembered by everyone, even though other animated films such as Beauty and the Beast garnered more prestige and acclaim. Twenty-five years have passed since the release of The Lion King and yet the film is fully capable of transporting you back to the innocence of the mid-90s. A magical film- one of the shining examples of Disney's renaissance and one that should not be missed regardless of your interest in cartoons."	
 classic	Even though i am 25, i still love this movie. It is a classic Disney movie that my 4 year old loves too. The really sad parts still get to me every time!	10
 The peak for Disney: perfect writing, direction, score, animation	"Disney truly outdid themselves in 1994. What left is there to be said about ""The Lion King""? So to sum up:This is the perfect story. The journey of a life time for protagonist Simba. The wisdom from Mufasa and Rafiki, the dynamic duo of Timon and Pumba. The perfect directional choices. The strongest score and pacing. Humour, emotion, humanity - in a fable tale depicting the animal kingdom.As a child, this was my first confrontation with death. At present day, it remains one of my few favorite films. It has truly stood the test of time with gorgeous characters, animation style, and all of the above, including frequent rewatchability.Perfection from Disney, and in my opinion their most beautiful film to date."	10
 Hands Down 10/10	Whether your a child or a parent people will class this film is a simple Classic.The animation of the film is outstanding, the music will make you somewhat emotional, but the storyline is where it's at, I have watched this film repeatedly over the years and each time have always come incredibly close to crying with certain parts of the film. To say this film is a classic is seriously understating on what this film actually is. There is a significant reason why every list of Best Disney Films on the internet have classed this film in its Top 3 if not No1 and there is a Broadway show on this film, if that doesn't give you enough evidence to go and see this film I don't know what will.	10
 Is this from 1994 of sure?	I love all series of Lion King, this idea was so wonderful, I cried when Mufasa died, but i guess that's the main idea of the movie, to grow up without anyone to support you, your parents, to learn how to live, but in the end we all discover what we are meant to be, I cant wait until the 2019 version comes out !!	10
 A movie everyone should have seen...	This movie is just pure childhood for me, one of the most memorable movies in history.	10
 Best Disney Movie Ever	"This Movie Makes me Wanna Sit Down & Watch it on ""Disney on CBC (Canada)"";James Earl Jones & Jeremy Irons Nails the Brother-on-Brother Rivalry Where One Kills the Brother, Takes the Throne, Exiles the Son, So Grows up, and Son Retakes the Throne.Hope to See the Live Action/CGI Remake Coming Out in July 2019."	10
 My all time favourite	This is my all time favourite film its the first film that ever made me cry and it still makes me cry but i love it such a powerful story line.I could watch it all day everyday!!!!!!	10
 The Best Animation	One of the best Animation,I really like the classic style of this animation	9
 My childhood movie	I enjoy every single song in this movie, also the drama, the characters. Love it! ^^	9
 This is what animated perfection looks like	I've seen a vast majority of animations. From old to new, and I've loved few and despised few. But The Lion King has moved me farther than any animation has, can, or will. What gives me this feeling is the fact that this was produced long before I was conceived, yet it makes me feel truly alive. From the score to the plot, this is masterful regarding every aspect, and it should be a role model for animations to come.	9
 The golden age of Disney right here	"One of the most beloved animated films The Lion King is a great take on Shakespeare's Hamlet. It must have been clever on the part of the studio heads to use the Shakespearean template and apply it to one of the most beloved of animals- the Lion. The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are very good and the soundtrack, albeit criticized as not being as memorable as other Disney films in some corners usually gets it right. The spectacular ""circle of life"" to open the film should be singled out. This is one of the best films of the Disney Renaissance period."	
 a disney classic	The lion king is a classic disney movie. The movie is all about how important family is and how it should never be taken for granted. Simba thought he was the one that had killed his father and he ended up leaving the rest of his family alone to fend for themselves. The movie ends with him having two families of his own. He has his biological family and a new chosen family.	10
 One of the greatest animation movies	There aren't litterary words to describe this epic movie. A strong story, with happy and sweet parts, dramatic parts that you want o cry for days, hillarious moments that also make you cry for days and a banch of intresting and unique characters. That all are the magic ingredients for a perfect movie. So perfect that actually opened the unlimited and magic world of animation.	10
 :P	This movie will never get old, no matter how many times we watch it and no matter how old we are. Today it made a dear friend of mine's day better. So, if this movie wasn't made, my friend would be having a sad day, but thanks to the people who made this movie happen, my friend is all good now, and I love anyone who makes my baby girl's day better. When a movie manages to cheer up a person more than 10 years after it was made, then it proves to everyone that it was one successful movie. If you're having a sad day, maybe you should watch this movie. If a friend is having a sad day, maybe you should suggest this movie to them.	10
 Nearly 25 years later, still the king of animated movies.	"When Disney released ""The Lion King"" during the busy summer of 1994, during which Forrest Gump would become the best picture winner and millions of people watched the OJ bronco chase on TV during an NBA Finals game between the Knicks and Rockets and ordering pizza in droves, it became a cultural milestone not only at the box office, but in merchandising. The storyline on the movie blends in MacBeth with African culture in 84 minutes of pure excitement. The movie tells the story of Simba, a young cub lion raised by Mufasa and his wife Sarabi, who travels the plains and meets up with Nala and their companion bird Zazu, along with the predictable monkey Rafiki. During a stampede, Simba watches in horror as his dad falls into the running crowd after losing grip of Scar's paws, causing him to perish into lion heaven. On his own, Simba meets up with Timon and Pumbaa, and they grow up to be like adults. In the end, Simba fights Scar to the death and helps Nala give birth to Kion, who will become the next lion king in the made for video sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. As for Timon and Pumbaa, they will return in an animated tv series and a prequel between lion king 1 and 2 called lion king 1 and a half. A tv series called the lion guard would soon follow, and a live action remake will bring new audiences who didn't grow up watching the original will get a chance to relive it all over again!!! As for the movie itself, it's timeless and memorable. I first saw this movie when it was in theatres and it stunned me. I would relive it over again when i saw it on vhs and again on DVD in a special edition that adds in a happy song, ""Morning Report"", as well as the IMAX soundtrack from the reissue in addition to the original 5.1 theatrical soundtrack. A 3D conversion would soon goose up the profits until Frozen broke the record for highest grossing cartoon in modern dollars."	10
 A Great Disney Movie!	This movie has so many great musical numbers, that they always stick in my head. The plot was great. And within a 2 hour movie, it showed great responsibility, reminding me of Simba as Spider-Man, as his duty is to the circle of life.	10
 My favourite Disney animation		10
 A Movie that's Worth Watching for People of All Ages	I watched this movie quite a few years back but I still remember everything and this is one animated movie that touched me. I mean, how mature an animated can be despite being a children's movie - this is the best example. There are lots of things to learn from this movie and I have shown it to my son who seemed have understood what this movie is actually about. Family, friends and your intentions all matter a lot in life and this movie has shown it all in a funny yet amazing manner. I am lucky to have watched this movie and I will make sure that my grandkids also watch it. They will learn something in life.	9
 Great Movie	This is a movie that available at TV when holiday begins.	8
 The Lion King (Spoiler)	"The movie I chose to watch was, ""The Lion King."" After watching this movie, I was able to analyze the world views and themes of this contemporary movie. In this movie, the main character or hero was a lion named Simba. Near the end of the movie, Simbas's main goal is to get rid of his uncle, Scar, who is controlling his land and take back what belongs to him as king. The main adversary he had was Scar because he was controlling his family and territory and Simba had to learn to be strong and fight for what belongs to him. Simba's character flaw at first would be that he is afraid to move on from his past and step up as a leader. Simba's apparent defeat would be when he feels hopeless and lost because he is scared and confused about what to do about becoming king. When Nala comes to seek him for help, he is at first afraid and doubts himself because he is afraid that he will not have the strength to defeat Scar. The final confrontation would be between Simba and Scar when they are fighting on a cliff. At first Simba tells him to leave and never come back but Scar instead tries to kill Simba which results in them fighting. In the end, Simba wins and the he realizes how even though he was afraid of not being as great of a leader as his father was, he was just as great or even better because he reclaimed and restored his rightful territory. The result of his change would be that he finally regained his family and place as rightful king. Overall, I think the main theme would be that although the past can hurt(like when Simba's dad died), and no matter what you have done, we cannot run away from our problems, but rather confront them and choose to persevere. One part of the movie that shows evidence for the movie's moral or message was when Rafiki hit Simba in the head with his staff and told him that ""sometimes the past can hurt."" Rafiki taught him that although the past can hurt we have to persevere and move on to become who we were meant to be. I agree with this theme because many of us are going through hard times but it does not mean that we should give up or run away from our responsibilities. I think the only thing I would have done differently was go back sooner to help my family because I would feel responsible for them and my territory. I think that this movie coincides with biblical truth because Simba's father comes back in the form of clouds(like God might), to tell Simba that he lives inside Simba(like the Holy Spirit). He tells Simba that he has forgotten him and who Simba really is, just like some of us forget to remember God, our father. The only part that I thought might stray away from biblical truth would be when his father tells him that Simba needs to look inside himself, which as Christians we should look to God not ours,even for strength. By saying this I think they are trying to portray the worldview of Individualism, and how we do not need anyone to help us but maybe a reminder. I think that this movie ultimately condemns evil because in then end Simba defeats his uncle, Scar and takes back what truly belonged to him. I think the main world views in the movie are Post-Modernism and Christianity. I think that they arr portraying the world view of Post-Modernism in it a little because they have the characters of Timon and Pumbaa telling Simba, that ""when the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world."" They also teach him the famous ""Hakuna Matata"" song which talks about having no worries in life and living how you want. I think that the movie also portrays some aspects of Christianity because when Simba is talking to his dad in the clouds, he tells Simba that he must take his place in the circle of life and remember who he is, because Simba is his son and ""the one true king."" In my opinion, this portrays the world view of Christianity because he is basically telling Simba that he needs to remember his purpose in life and remember that he is the one true king, which sounds like Jesus who is the one true king, which we are told about in the Bible. I think that a positive element would be that the movie portrays some positive themes like how we should persevere through all the hurts and roadblocks in our lives. I think a negative element would be that they include the part of Hakuna Matata, and saying how it is okay to live a life care free, and only worrying about oneself. I think that I would recommend this movie to most people and kids because it has a positive message and is rated PG which is appropriate for most ages."	9
 Its a Disney classic.	This movie is pretty good. Except for a few dumb moments and ideas, this movie is very entertaining with great animation, story, and voice acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I'd recommend watching it.	7
 Great Movie For young and old people	This movie is great which can entertain people of all age groups.The animation of the movie is also great or you can say ahead of his time in that year	
 Watching TLK for the second time is epic		8
 Return of the prodigal lion	The Lion king, is a story of guilt, shame and realisation of one's worth. Simba, the young lion who feels guilty of a sin of killing his father runs away to hide from his sin. On realising that running away is not the answer guided by a monkey (consciousness...most philosophies refer one's consciousness to a monkey) comes back and takes the rightful place. The story of coming back is filled with love, care and pride.	8
 20 days of Disney Day 2: The Lion King	"I will not be the first to say I freaking LOVE this movie. It is such a masterpiece in the hall of Disney fame. It is so nice to see that even over 20 years later, still not much can beat The Lion King. The story is about Simba, a lion who's, and I know I don't give any spoilers when I say this, father, Mufasa, dies when Simba was young. He meets Timon and Pumba, and learns the saying Hakuna Matata, which means no worries. It is still so weird that this films story remains a masterpiece. Simba is a very likable character. Scar, in my opinion, is one of the most amazing villains in a Disney film EVER. And with villains like Ursula from Little Mermaid and Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians, that's an accomplishment. Now I am going to say it, I don't like Timon and Pumba. You can hate me all you want, you can boo me. I personally don't find them funny. But for the rest of the movie- oh, you thought I forgot the songs? I LOVE these songs. Maybe if I had to choose my least favorite, it would be ""I just can't wait to be king"". I think it cheesy. Personally, I feel like it is just a masterpiece among the Disney Vault."	9
 A classic of animation.	The Lion King is considered by many the best animation in history, is it? Well The Lion King is really an excellent animation, it is top 5 of Disney without doubt, the plot is good, the characters are cool, the animation has exciting moments, the quality is excellent, the soundtrack is incredible, but I admit that it had moments James Earl Jones is as impeccable as Mufasa, but he is a very good actor, and he is a great actor, Matthew Broderick, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Whoopi Goldberg and so on are all impeccable, The Lion King is a great animation with great and exciting moments and a great ending and an unforgettable opening. Note 9.4	9
 Wow!	The Lion King is a great film. Along with a great story (inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet), terrific animation, and an all star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a little rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honor.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen. It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget. And hopefully, you won't either. A++	8
 Disney's Greatest Ever		8
 Disney's Greatest	This epic movie is the pride and joy of Disney. With an epic soundtrack and fine writing and casting the adventures of Sinba the Lion Prince and all his friends and family brings much joy and excitement to universal audiences. The religious significance of the Circle of Life is a core part of this masterpiece. The popularity is down to the message of the film but no film is complete without a villain the cruel and evil Scarface voiced by Jeremy Irons. Is one of the greatest villains ever seen! Not really an intimidating character, rather a master manipulator. Lion King if not the greatest animated movie ever released is among the top 10 greatest movies ever made.	
 This is one of the best movies I've seen.	This was a great movie. The story line is very good. Simba faces challenges posed by his uncle Scar and he must find the strength to overcome them. This movie is fairly funny and has some good lessons to take away from it.Early in the movie Simba's Uncle Scar ends up killing Mufasa. Scar intends to also kill Simba, but Simba is able to escape. Simba does not return to his old kingdom until his childhood friend, Nala, shows up one day. By this time Simba has already grown up. Back in his old kingdom, Scar has taken control of everyone. He allows the heinas to rule along with him. Simba returns with Nala and is ultimately able to overcome his Uncle Scar. Simba restores the kingdom to its past glory and becomes one of the great leaders.	8
 a nice movie to watch with family, good nostalgia filter.	this is a pleasant, feel good film. there are definitely some great scenes and memorable actions in this movie. a great film, but like all, it has its short points.i believe that mufasa died too early in order to feel a connection to him. like other people, i did not cry when this happened. all that i had understood was the sense of betrayal from his brother.scar's moments with the hyenas were very well enjoyed, i wish they had more screen time! i also enjoyed the moments with timon and pumbaa, but they felt too much of comedy relief.in conclusion, you should watch this movie if you shockingly haven't already. it is a great film, with classic Disney nostalgia filter.	9
 Classic Disney	Ah The Lion King. The highest grossing hand drawn animated movie of all time and the former highest grossing animated movie ever. As a kid, I absolutely adored this movie to the point where it was my favorite movie ever. However, nowadays, my reaction has kind of waned. Now don't get me wrong, I still love this movie but I will admit that there are better Disney movies. My main problem with this movie is Timon and Pumbaa. The fart jokes are obnoxious and I just didn't like their personalities. They feel like they're the same annoying character in 2 bodies. Even if your do like them, they kind of break the mood. Think about it. They're introduced maybe 10 minutes after Mufasa's death with their stupid fart jokes and dumb song. That's another problem with this movie. Hakuna Matata, while I do like it as a catchphrase, is an annoying song. Timon and Pumbaa cannot sing, the song is all over place, it goes on for way too long and it just comes in too soon after Mufasa's death, which was a really big thing for kids back then. Speaking of that, yeah, his death was a big surprise when the movie came out and it messed up a lot of kids for life. Plus the fact that they show the dead body! The story itself is very dark and almost adult. For example, they really emphasize how harsh life in the Pridelands is under Scar's reign. Another great thing about this movie is obviously the animation. It's hand drawn Disney animation and it looks incredible. However, what sets the animation apart from other Disney animation is just how big the movie is in scale. The 3D release for this movie was absolutely phenomenal. Everything was so much bigger and things were literally flying off-screen by the audience. I still remember the moment where Zazu flew by the audience at the beginning of the film. I actually flinched to the side because of how close it was. The characters in this movie are all very likable, outside of Timon and Pumbaa. In fact, the other comedy reliefs, the hyenas and Zazu, are much funnier, much more likable and much more timeless. Overall, I do love this movie despite it's quirks.	9
 Far from my favorite Disney movie and may, IMO, be very slightly overrated	Do not get me wrong when I say that I enjoyed this adaptation of Hamlet, with a few songs that I could remember (more than Aladdin, which boosted points), an emotional scene that would become a cliché in plenty of movies to follow, such as The Good Dinosaur, and some pop-culture references that, despite being somewhat out of place in a Tanzanian savanna, work occasionally (there are a few to less child-friendly films, such as In the Heat of the Night), and there was apparently a strong enough story to warrant a true sequel, an alternate timeline, two spin-offs, and cameos in plenty of other Disney productions. Compared to other animated films of 1994 (such as A Troll in Central Park), it is a major step up. However, now that I see it as my critic self, I found little enjoyment with Pumbaa other than the fascinating voice given to him by Ernie Sabella. While The Lion King isn't the first Disney movie to have restroom humor (Beauty and The Beast and The Great Mouse Detective had belching scenes), I was miffed by constant allusions to Pumbaa's issue with wind. When he tries to be funny in other ways, he can occasionally work, but I prefer Timon. Because of that issue, this is just outside the you-must-see category in the feel-free-to-check-it-out category.	8
 Epic voice over, epic sound track, unforgettable songs, yet plot is a little bit too simple.	Epic voice over, epic sound track, unforgettable songs, and yet plot is a little bit too simple. Very brilliant character, the voices of the villain and the old king are both dramatic and majestic. The plot is kind of simple and stupid, after all it's aimed to be a kid's movie. The way the old king got killed and the way villain died are ridiculous. Also, how the hero got away from danger again and again is simply not reasonable. Right from the start the movie shows how all the other animals must bow to the old king is also not very pleasing to watch-----why not let all the animals live equally ? Anyway, it's a good movie as a whole. And it deserves an 8 as a cartoon.	8
 Disney's best animated feature since The Brave Little Toaster!	The Lion King is probably one of Disney's best animated features. The story is about a young lion cub named, Simba, who wants to be king of the jungle. The voice cast was great, it has James Earl Jones, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Whoopie Goldberg, Jim Cummings, and other voice talents. The animation is wonderful, it looks like the movies animators got it all right! This movie has some of the best Disney songs. Circle of Life is just an amazing song and there's other great ones. I love the characters, Timon & Pumba are hilarious. There's a scene in the middle where Simba's father gets killed by Scar. Scar is the villain in this movie and he wants to be king, that's the main reason why Scar killed Mafasa, Simba's dad. The ending was happy and great. A Disney movie that's much better than The Brave Little Toaster! Check The Lion King out, you'll love it!	
 My favorite Disney movie	The Lion King is my favorite Disney movie ever. It is such a beautiful story that after all these years still gets to me. I loved this movie as a kid. And 20 years later I still do. The story is great and the characters all have something to love. (Yes, even the hyenas because they are so comical at times). I also still enjoy the jokes they make, especially how they play with words sometimes. The music also is simply beautiful. It was the first movie soundtrack I ever bought. I can recommend this movie to everyone from every age. I have nothing negatives about this movie. Even the sequels are nice, which is very rare. It is just perfect.	10
 everybody should see this movie	I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age.It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar.	10
 The Lion King is a great movie.	"The Lion King is one of my favorite movies ever, especially Matthew Broderick who played Ferris Bueller in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" voicing adult Simba. I think the best part of the movie is when Simba defeats his uncle to take the jungle throne to become king. I have seen the movie lots of times. My favorite part is when Pumbaa says: ""They call me Mr. Pig!"" ""Hakuna Matata"" is such a fun song to sing along to in the movie and ""it means no worries for the rest of the days."" This movie was probably one of my favorite Disney classics of all-time. James Earl Jones who previously played Mr. Mertle in the 1993 film ""The Sandlot"" voiced Mufasa, Simba's father and Scar's older brother. This movie will have your kids singing along to ""Hakuna Matata."" It is such a great movie. The cutest part is when Simba is learning to pounce. The Lion King is an all time favorite."

 A retrospective review		8
 Fantastic movie for all ages	"This is a movie that I believe everyone should see during their lifetime. It is filled with life lessons and great life advice, and is both a heart wrenching and fun and enjoyable movie. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The graphics on this movie may not be the ""best"" for the year that we are in, but they are astounding for the year in which this movie was made. This movie is suitable for young children to watch as it is seemingly fun and cute. But at the same time, there are parts of this movie that make you rethink aspects of your life. As an adult I believe it is acceptable for me to say that this is also a movie that adults can enjoy even though it was originally made for a younger audience. The Lion King is a movie that I believe every movie lover should have within their collection. The movie itself and the ideals and ideas within the movie withstand time and will continue to do so in coming years. In all I believe The Lion King is a must-see and must-own movie that won't leave you disappointed, regardless of who you are or what your age may be."	10
 Over 20 Years Later, Still A Crowning Achievement!!!	I have to say is probably my all-time favorite film Disney has ever made. Yeah, there's allot of stuff I really enjoy, but The Lion King was in many ways my childhood.The characters are fantastic, my favorite being Adult Simba. Yes, I know he's voiced by Matthew Broderick, and I have seen his acting as kinda dull. But WOW! This is his best performance! He turned this character into a noble BADASS. And I'm really glad he still does the voice in several other pieces of work. I can't see anybody else voicing him. I love the characters design, Simba really started the idea of a young teenage/young adult warrior, leading his comrades and friends into adventures.The villain, Amazing and Memorable! And you can totally see how Disney based there version of Loki later on. How does the story hold up now? Well, when watching it several times growing up, I thought it was its own original thing, which made me love it even more. But it wasn't till I became a bit more curious in the making of the film that I bought the Special Edition DVD, and found out it was based on stories like Hamlet and Moses.Of course we can't leave out the Elephant in the room. No not The Elephant Graveyard. I'm talking of course about when Simba's father Mufasa died. This scene still gets to me emotionally, even more than when I was a kid. You watch this scene and you might even think of your own Father. You wanna find him and hug him. I don't know why, but when a parent, or pet dies in a movie, its always an urge to me to find my own and hug them.The animation? What can I say, its Disney at its finest hour. The designs, the backgrounds, the environment. It's absolutely beautiful to view from the eye. Its almost like Africa came right out of the painted lines. However, one of the best pieces in the film is the music! This is some of the best music I ever heard in a motion picture. So many talented people made the soundtrack unforgettable. Hans Zimmer, this is when he really gave his scores different characters, you know, before he made everything and Inception BRWONG! This is defiantly one of his best pieces. Then there's of course the songs by Tim Rice and Elton John. We all know these songs by heart and is part of our collective minds. Every song is ear loving. My favorite honestly, is not Be Prepared, not Hakuna Matata, not even The Circle Of Life, its Can You Feel The Love Tonight. Elton's and Disney's version are an example of Musical Beauty. This is Disney's crowing achievement in there Love Song category.But honestly, the majority of the credit to the films music is Lebo M. Allot of people don't know much about him, and its kind of sad considering that he had such a troubled life. But he made this score work 1000%. He brought in the African part to the score and I honestly don't think the score would be nearly as amazing without his contribution. The quire, the drums, the chants. Its so entrancing. He's even gone on to do more work for Disney, including extended albums and musicals.With the music and animation, this movie really sparked my interest in African culture. I can't tell you how much I want to go the Africa because of this film's art form.The ending is also an amazing feat. The BIG EPIC BATTLE is of course amazing, as well as THE FINAL BATTLE with Simba and Scar, which is just so GOD DAMN AMAZING to watch. Seriously, buy the largest TV possible, turn off the lights, turn up the volume and enjoy the best cat fight you'll ever see. And to see the films happy ending is almost tear dropping to watch. Simba's climb to his throne still gives me the chills, and his roar. WOW! Blows me away.Throughout my life, I've seen the film numerous times on several formats. The VHS is the one we all grew up with as kids and the Blu Ray is pretty good with its cleaned up prints. But if you want the perfect version of the film with enough bonus material to last a week, I'd say get the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD from 2004. But by far the best version of the film I've seen was when it was re released in 3-D a few years ago. I did not expect it to be as amazing as I thought it would be. Not only did it make me reflect on my youth, but HOLY SH**! THE 3-D, PICTURE AND SOUND WAS INCREDIBLE!!! It was so crystal clear that I saw things in the background that I never noticed before. You could swear that they added stuff in, but no. It was there from the beginning. The Sound was loud and larger than life. Some of the best sound work I saw in a theater, and when the songs were on, everybody got up, danced and sang along. It was so much fun. And the 3- D? Some of the best 3-D I've seen, almost Avatar 3-D. When Scar jumps out of the fire, Jesus was that close. So with all this amazing pieces of talent, art and its 20 year legacy, I still think the film holds up after 20 years. Its childhood, its culture, it has character connections, the music is incredible. Its defiantly one of my favorite films and to me, Disney's crowning achievement. It's defiantly going to go on to hold up for generations to come, even after we die and become connected to The Circle Of Life. 10/10	10
 the lion king	The lion king is quite a good film because its my favourite Disney film and that my favourite character is Simba. The songs are quite good in the film, but that's my opinion. There is one fighting scene in it as the film goes on. Overall in my opinion it will probably be the best kids film you will have ever watched in your while life. Also there will be a bit of upsetting parts in the film like the death of Simbas dad when Scar pushes him off the edge of a cliff. But apart from that it will be a really good film to watch with younger family members that you will enjoy Also its the best film that has a song to it that i think is called Can You Feel The Love Tonight	10
 Classic Disney.	The Lion King is one of Disney's most classic films because it truly will warm your heart. Characters you can fall in love with or fall in anger with. You will get emotional watching this movie because of how invested you get with the storyline and characters. The Lion King covers love, friendship, family, death and triumph. This movie has a great soundtrack as well as good animation. Definitely a movie both kids and adults will love to see. I watched it when I was young and loved it, I will continue to watch it with my siblings as they grow up and I cannot wait to watch it with my own children someday. Truly a classic tale that also contains courage and bravery. The sequels are very good as well.	10
 My favorite movie in the whole world	With this movie, it was definitely love at first sight! I remember I made my parents and grandparents take me to the movies many times to watch it again, and then I got the VHS cassette as a gift, and I would watch it so many times, they had to only allow me to see it 2 times a week, 3 times each day.. Imagine how many times I watched it before that!Then, all grown-up, I got as a gift the DVD Special Edition, and I must say it was the best gift ever!It's so children appropriate, with sad parts of course, but hey! that's life :)	10
 Disneys Best Animated Film		10
 The God Within	"When Simba goes to the river and sees the hologram of Mufasa, Mufasa says: ""Simba, LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF, you are more than what you have become"" I never felt I belong here to this planet. A journey to learn filmmaking, to create and transcend, turned out to be a reawakening journey of my own and found God. There had been some very hard times when I was trapped, depressed, then detached, I was in myself, there I found the light within and solved a piece of puzzle. When I look back at all those years and questions how I was able to do so, I saw the movie The Lion King, illuminating the whole path that I had taken. ""Look inside yourself"", that's where you find answers and strength, no matter whatever happens, for that is the god within.Forever thanks to the movie, The Lion King. It is the best educational movie of all time. I strongly recommend it to people of all ages, kids and adults."	10
 Excellent animation and storyline	The Lion King is a film that teaches us about nature's circle of life, as a lion cub born in the Pride Lands of Africa, learns what responsibility means as he grows up. Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is the cub of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is a typical curious youngster. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), is not happy with being replaced as future king and develops a plot to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba. In the meantime, Mufasa is teaching Simba about the circle of life and how we are all intertwined in it. This theme is seen in the Disney movie Pocahontas during the song, Color of the Wind, where Pocahontas (Judy Kuhn) sings to John Smith (Mel Gibson) how everything in nature is connected together. The Lion King's cinematography is very well done with the close-up shots of Simba showing his various emotions of curiosity, being scared, and sadness as his father, Mufasa, dies. The close-up shots, along with the superb visual effects, allow you to feel those same emotions. I found it very difficult not to cry when Mufasa dies. The special effects in the elephant graveyard with the fire, and perfect sound effects, allows you to feel how scared a young Simba and Nala (Niketa Calame) may feel. After Mufasa's death, at the hands of Scar, Simba runs away from his life at Pride Rock and grows up in the jungle with two friends, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane). They live by their carefree motto Hakuna Matata, as Simba becomes a young adult (Matthew Broderick). Just like anyone else, Simba knows he cannot live that carefree life anymore and must return to Pride Rock after finding out that Scar has broken that circle of life and destroyed the lands. Once Simba, Pumbaa, Timon, and Nala (Moira Kelly) return to the Pride Lands and win the battle in the climax of the film, the rain comes in and washes away the past, allowing the circle of life to begin again. Simba takes his place on top of Pride Rock as the new king. In the final scene we see the same as the beginning of the film, with the presentation of a cub lion, but this time that cub belongs to Simba and Nala. The circle of life has come full circle.	9
 The Best 2D Movie so far	The Lion King movie is superb. Apart from being excellently animated with great sound effects, I appreciate the use of actual African Swahili words. They were well interpreted and used correctly. The story line is awesome especially where Simba has to make a difference and bring in the bad guys into the right fold. The use of colors and sound was well executed. I love the fact that its a movie that I can watch with my mature or grownup guys and not hide it from the young ones. It is very encouraging - morally speaking and has a strong moral teaching that provides direction on some stuff one can do when they are faced with challenges or when they need to find light in the midst of darkness. It is was well researched and I would definitely watch it again.	9
 Walt Disney Would Be Proud	"This is an outstanding Disney film that Walt Disney (the man himself) would be proud of. The Lion King is a good solid story with fun songs and very likable characters. It is one of the funniest Disney animated films ever made. The movie does have some very sad moments as well but it is mainly a good comedy. It's a film that is well suited for the entire family - not just the kids.If you like The Lion King, try these Disney classics out for size: ""The Jungle Book"", ""Bambi"", ""The Fox and the Hound"" or ""The AristoCats"".I would also like to plug: The Lion King 2 and The Lion King 1 1/2.10/10"	10
 Everyone's Childhood Favourite	The Lion King came out when I was about 5 years old, and is just one of those wonderful movies that always stays with you. It's a movie that even adults can enjoy, and one of those that you can watch again as an adult, and have more understanding of what's really happening in the film. With some classic musical moments and quotes, this is a must see movie for all, and definitely a wonderful family movie. A great soundtrack to add onto your iPod, and a movie that you can watch again and again. Like all good movies, it has its ups and downs, but its all about the journey along the way, and the lovable characters introduced. Hakuna Matata.	10
 # 1 movie	I love the Lion King and can watch it ever single day of my life. It's a movie that makes me laugh and cry at the same time!!!! I also love the live show in Disney. However, nothing compares to the original Lion King movie. The music is also incredible. I love EVERY single song and sing and dance with the movie each time. Completely a classic.IF you've never had the opportunity to see the lion king you must go out and get a copy of it. The Lion King is one of those movies that every person, all ages must view at some point in their life. GO out and treat yourself. You won't be disappointed.	10
 The Lion King		9
 This is a movie about a young lion struggling to find his place in the circle of life.	"When I was a little kid, every time I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer was not a teacher, an astronaut, an athlete, or a doctor, like most children. My answer was a lion. The Lion King was my favorite movie as a child and held a great impact on me. I watched it all the time and soon knew every word to the catchy songs. I think the movie is phenomenal and turned out to be a very entertaining movie. It is still one of my favorite movies today. This Disney animated movie is unique because unlike many other Disney favorites that were made around the same time, The Lion King is one of the few that was not based on a previous story (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""), and in my opinion is the best Disney movie of all time. This movie provides the audience with many upbeat songs and essential life lessons. First, the film shows that everyone should own up to his or her responsibilities as adults, or there may be consequences. This is seen when Simba, who should go back to the Pride Lands, his former home, and take his place as king, refuses to go back. Meanwhile back at the Pride Lands, Scar, the present king and Simba's uncle, has destroyed the kingdom and made life miserable for Simba's family and all the other lions. Another good lesson that is learned is shown when Rafiki, a wise monkey, hits Simba on the head with his walking stick. Simba, disgruntled, asks what he did to deserve that and Rafiki answers him by saying that whatever the reason, it does not matter anymore. Simba, confused, agrees but explains that it still hurts. Rafiki provides his advice by saying ""Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it"" (""The Lion King Quotes""). This quote from Rafiki was one of the main reasons that Simba eventually went back to the Pride Lands, even when he vowed to never return because he did not want to face his past. Simba thought Scar told everyone in the Pride Lands that Simba had killed his father and Scar's brother, Mufasa, the former king, when in actuality Scar was the one that killed him. A popular saying that has been gained from The Lion King is ""Hakuna Matata"". This is a phrase that Simba learns from his new best friends he meets after he runs away from home, Timon and Pumbaa. Hakuna Matata becomes the three's motto, which they comprehend as meaning ""no worries"". This phrase is known widely in the world, meaning that people should not worry about the small things in life and worry as less as possible. The Lion King not only tells a good message, but also is very entertaining as confirmed by an online critic ""this stylish, ambitious and magical film provides a delightfully entertaining experience for moviegoers of all ages"" (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""). The words in this quote 'stylish', 'ambitious', 'magical' and 'delightful' all perfectly describe The Lion King as a whole. The movie is very optimistic, leaving the audience with a good feeling at the ending. It is also not only for children. The songs may be childish, however they are still very catchy and many adults and teenagers still sing along to them while watching the movie. The Lion King is an ideal movie to watch for a family movie night or a night alone. There have been questions concerning whether this film is appropriate or not for children. For example, ""Scar arranges Mufasa's disturbing on-screen death in a manner that both banishes Simba to the wilderness and raises questions about whether this film really warranted a G rating"" (Maslin, ""The Lion King (1994)""), was stated in a review posted in The New York Times. However, the concept of the circle of life is mentioned many times throughout the film. Mufasa explains to Simba that even though they eat other animals, when they die, their bodies become the grass, and the other animals eat the grass. This concept lightens death in a way that is acceptable for children to hear and understand. I can also say that when I was a kid I was never too frightened by Mufasa's death or other scenes in the movie to watch it and have never heard of a child being scared of The Lion King. Also, if a child that is too young to comprehend death watches the movie, they would most likely only pay attention to the songs anyways and not completely understand the plot."	10
 Most Positive Message Of Any Disney Film I've Seen		10
 To live life like a king, we must earn the throne.		8
 A very beautiful animated movie!!!	One of the most popular Disney animated musicals, The Lion King presents the story of a lion cub's journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. Simba (voiced first by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then by Matthew Broderick) begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons), murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and Timon the meerkat (voiced by Nathan Lane), he and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne. Borrowing elements from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer	8
 Lion King teaches lesson	Great movie! It teaches kids to stop being so gullible and that life is a learned lesson. I feel like it is suitable for all age groups to watch. The characters all represent different qualities and characteristics. These qualities are strength, will power, happiness, love, passion and more. The movies starts off with Simba as a baby. He is on a mission to be the king, however he has to be groomed. His father is showing him the ropes and making sure he is ready for the kingdom. Simba has to go through a lot of different experiences through out the movie to shape him into the man he needs to be. Along this journey is looses his father and he is manipulated by Mustafa into thinking the death of his father was his fault. He had to then realize that it wasn't, in which that made him grow as a person to be strong for others. This movie was great in so many different way. I hope you watch it and enjoy it as much as I did.	10
 The best one	"In my humble opinion, ""The Lion King"" (1994) is nothing less than the best Disney in the modern era.People of my generation have grown with this movie. I've seen it at least ten time. This pictorial representation of the African savanna and exotic animals still attracts us so much. It is obvious that this anime is full of inventiveness, virtuosity, humor and draws emotion.It's about the weight to assume his legacy, not to disappoint his parents. but we can also see it as the irresponsibility of the chain and animal alimentary.The cub Simba, forceps undergo an accelerated learning life after the death of his father Mufasa. he must confront his duplicitous uncle, Scar, a of the vilest villains that we could see.the animation reached very high levels, including this impressive sequence where a troupon wild wildebeest rushes canyon.the soundtrack is a festival of tubes. The splits emotions is done, and the characters all very typical and mignons.La immutable reference of 2D animation."	9
 Good old Disney movie	I've always been a huge fan of Disney films even now that I am not a child. I believe that Lion King is the BEST animation movie from Disney!! I still watch it and hope that the new generation will love it as i did as a child. OK, i know that we all love Simba, Timon and Pumba but i can say that Scar is one of my absolute favorite animated villain. Jeremy Irons did an amazing vocal covering with this character. I loved Lion King because it reminds me my childhood although i am not old enough to use that phrase. I recommend Lion King to all parents as a must watch film for their children like Toy Story, Mulan and the Wizard of Oz.	9
 One of the best animation movies EVER!	The lion king is and always has been 1 of my favourite animation films. Everything about it i love, just a great adventure/story, it does have its sad parts but they just make the film even better as it adds to it.I personally don't know anyone who doesn't like this, and i don't understand why people wouldn't like this, i can not fault it. This is a great family movie.I this this Lion king (the 1st one) is the best of them all so if you are going to give Lion king a try i would always recommend watching this one out of all of them. 10 out of 10.	10
 The Lion King	"Casey Cox English 1030 February 21, 2014 Project Two: Synopsis A young lad, destined to be the king, runs away after he was tricked into believing that he killed his father. The Lion King, released in 1994, was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The estimated budget for the film was around $45,000,000 (imdb.com). Starring the voices of Matthew Broderick as Simba the lion, Nathan Lane as Timon the meercat, and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa the warthog. The film received many nominations for awards, and it won an Oscar for the song ""Can you feel the love tonight"". It won Golden Globes for best soundtrack score, best original song for ""Can you feel the love tonight"", and best motion picture in the Comedy/Musical category. The plot revolves around a young lion named Simba who is next in line to become the king of the Pride Lands. His best friend is a young lioness named Nala and they are to be married when they are old enough. His father, Mufasa, is the current king and is happily married to Sarabi, the head lioness. Mufasa has a hornbill for an adviser named Zazu, and a younger brother named Scar. Scar is friends with the hyenas, and together they make an evil team. Scar is jealous because now Simba will become the king instead of Scar. He wants his revenge, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of Mufasa and Simba for good. The movies starts out with the wise baboon Rafiki showing off Simba to all of the animals in the Pride Lands. One day, Simba and Nala go to an elephant graveyard, despite being forbidden to go there. They are attacked by three of the hyenas; Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. They are about to kill the lion cubs when Mufasa, being warned by Zazu, shows up and saves them both. Simba is then reprimanded and he promises his father that he will become more obedient. A short while later Scar decides to get his revenge. He leads Simba down to the gorge and tells him to work on his wimpy roar. The three hyenas are at the top of the gorge and they cause a stampede of wildebeests into the gorge, putting Simba's life in danger. Zazu then warns Mufasa of Simba's whereabouts and Mufasa rushes to save him. Mufasa saves Simba, but is injured by the stampeding herd. When he tries to climb up the gorge, Scar digs his claws into Mufasa's paws and throws him back down killing him. Scar then blames Simba for Mufasa's death and tells the cub to ""run away, and never return"" (The Lion King, 1994). Simba runs away and is quickly found by Timon and Pumbaa, two good natured friends who want to help Simba with his problems. The three live together for many years and base their lives on the slogan ""Hakuna Matata"" which means ""No Worries"" (The Lion King, 1994). One day as the friends are out and about, a female lioness spots Pumbaa and tries to hunt and kill him. Simba, now a grown lion, attacks the lioness and the two struggle. Simba then recognizes her as Nala, his childhood friend. The two catch up and Nala tells him that Scar has ruined the Pride Lands, allowing the hyenas to rule with him and that Simba needs to come back and claim his place as king. However, Simba is still overcome with the guilt of believing that he killed his father and he refuses to go back. He is then reminded by Rafiki that his father lives within him and wants him to go back to his home and take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to his home to find it in ruins. It is dark and grey, there are hyenas everywhere and everyone seems sad and broken down. When Scar sees Simba, Scar's first thought is that Mufasa had risen from the dead since Simba looked so much like his father. Scar tries to humiliate Simba by telling all of the lions that Simba killed his father. Scar and Simba then start fighting and lightning strikes starting a fire. Scar almost overpowers Simba and he holds Simba off a cliff in the same manner that he held Mufasa off the cliff. Scar then leans over and whispers to Simba that it was actually he who killed Mufasa and it was not Simba's fault at all. Simba is filled with anger and he gains the strength to attack Scar. He throws his uncle over a small cliff, where the hyenas attack and kill Scar. It promptly starts raining putting out the fire, and Simba takes his place as king of the Pride Lands. A while later the Pride Lands have been restored to their previous natural beauty. Simba married Nala and the two have had a son. Rafiki then comes and shows off their son to the animals in the kingdom, just as he had done before with Simba."	8
 Scar: Misunderstood?	When discussing this epic movie, there is always some guy saying:''Well, I didn't cry when Mufasa died. Why should I? Scar was the ultimate character of the movie with all these lines, being ironic and after all he was deeply misunderstood''. Let's take this straight...Scar, neglected by his parents...always left out...watching Mufasa being raised as the favorite son, turned bad...There is some truth to this, but what about personal choice? Scar chose to kill his own brother and sent Simba away racked with guilt in order to rule the kingdom...Clap clap... Instead, he could be cool uncle Scar: ignoring power, loved by his nephew and all the others for being just that!(OK nobody would watch that:-P) What I really want to say is, we can't just blame our predecessors for what we've become...It's all about choicesWhere are WE in this circle of life?	9
 One of the best.	The Lion King is by far one of the best movies ever released. I remember watching it on VHS as a little girl, and loving every minute of it. Hakuna Matata is the perfect song to sing when you're in a bad mood. So many good memories tied in with this one. Timon and Pumbaa are my favorite characters, simply because they are drop dead hilarious and have made so many lives so much happier just because of a simple joke. The hyenas freak me out a little, but they're very interesting characters. Simba is the typical child, impulsive, wild and ready to do what they want because they want to see for themselves instead of taking their parents word for it.	10
 Nota 10!	I think is the best movie that Disney has ever produced! Very well done and with a beautiful story! Have adapted the story (which I think they have been inspired by William Shakespeare's Hamlet) with mastery! My Congratulations to Disney! They managed to produce something artistic and totally believable! I fell in love not only for design visual quality but also the quality of the script and the characters (their actions and personalities were firm, strong and well structured). I really fell in love. It was the first movie I watched in the cinema (I was a child at the time). It's a beautiful film to look at and review multiple times! I find it hard someone does not like the movie, is actually very good and who is of my generation know that this film was part of our childhoods! Gorgeous! Spectacular! Wonderful! Speechless! Script, characters, actions, technology, visual quality, soundtrack, all grade 10! Really a nice story: D	10
 A very bias opinion	I generally would try to take an objective approach when writing a review but this time i wont even try. This is one of my favourite cartoons. It's great for children and adults alike. It is one of the great Disney musicals. Definitely one of the top ten kids cartoons ever made.The music is amazing and dramatic. Tim Rice and Elton John have done a brilliant job. The music brings the story to life. But not only does the music carry the story, the songs themselves stand on their own. Songs like 'Circle of Life' and 'Hakuna Matata' have become timeless classics.I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone. If you have kids it is a must see for them.Happy viewing. :)	10
 Lion King- Great Movie!	I watched this movie when I was 5 years old and I enjoyed it then and still now. Simba was my favorite. I wish that they would have another movie. The music in the movie was great! Everyone should have a chance to watch this movie. Doesn't matter if you or young or old. The movie is good for anyone. It will teach you a lesson. I would really like to see a remake or extended movie of the Lion King. The makers should work on that. It would be cool if I could have a voice-over part in the new movie, if they would do it. I look forward to being an actress and can't wait to have the roles start coming in. Please check out the movie. It's awesome!!!	10
 A timeless picture, one for all ages.		9
 Classic tale from Disney	It's been long since I have read the comic version of Lion King, but I never got a chance to see the animated version. Today, I watched the movie without much anticipation, since I was aware of much of the movie. But, I was amazed by it, the way it is presented, which suits both children and adults. The tale of Mahabharata is identical to the plot. The king who lost his kingdom by the betrayal of his cousin, his wandering days through forest along with his brothers and wife, his comeback and the great war. We Indians values our epics, and they say every story is rooted on Mahabharata. As for Lion King, the depiction of our saga was a brilliant one. Classic Disney treatment helped it to capture the essence of pride. The movie is not a computer animated one, which is now a sensation, but Lion King is compatible to any movie that releases today. It has sentiments, a strong message, and with little humor as possible. There are many Japanese animation movies, notably from Hayao Miyasaki. They are timeless classics, yet are not computer animated. We can place Lion King, of course with many other Disney movies, with them. I am pretty sure that I can watch it again and again with out annoyance, because thats why it is called a classic...	9
 The story of the Lion King	The Lion King is one of the most acclaimed animation movies by the Disney Studios. It tells the story of a young lion cub, Simba, whose father is the king of the Savannah and gets murdered by his greedy, megalomaniac uncle Scar in order to become the king himself. Simba then flees into the jungle to escape from his murderous uncle, where he meets the sympathetic duo composed by warthog Pumba and mongoose Timon. They then proceed to introduce him to their hedonistic and careless way of life. Once Simba learns that he must face his responsibilities and that escaping is maybe the easiest, but not the best way... This movie, without any doubt one of Disney's masterpieces, grabs you by the balls and doesn't let you go until Simba becomes the King. Alternating grippingly emotional moments that will bring you on the verge of crying like a girl, and funny scenes that will leave you breathless of laughing, the film also includes some very catchy songs by Phil Collins that are still sung by the generation that grew up with the movie.	
 It made me	You may think that lion kind is just a movie for kids,but i think that the ideas in this movie created a flame inside every kid (i was a kid when i watched it).This flame is the desire for power.And it teaches us how powerful people should be.In addition it shows kids that life was never ideal and will never be.Simba was so young when his father was killed and he felt guilty about it,He went far from his place carrying that guilt. he wanted to drop that load so he lived with Timon and Bumba a silly easy life.But the king inside him woke up when his family needed him.IT made me feel that inside every person there is a KING,and it made me to work hard to search for that king inside me. Although scar was a king but the bad spirit inside him,made everything be so miserable. Everyone must watch this movie,it is the type of movies that kids must watch in order to know and understand more about life.Really it summarizes too much things like power,dreams,dealing with obstacles,love... It is really a school...	10
 One of the Best Animated Film I Have Ever Seen, if not the Best	A fantastic movie, everything is excellent, the characters, the idea, the drawings, the scenes, everything in this movie is fantastic.Even now that we have the lucky to see cartoons almost real and in 3D, this movie by itself can survive even when it was made almost 20 years ago.I can see this movie as many times as I want and I never will be bored by watching it, by son liked it, and I am sure my grandsons will loved it too,If you haven't watched this movie, you MUST watch it.FANTASTIC! If I could I would rate it as 11 instead of 10.	10
 Classic and timeless	This is a powerful and beautiful story, it was actually the first movie to make me cry as a kid. Not to mention it is also very fun and can be light and has a great comical aspect as well. You really do fall in love with the characters and their stories. The music composition is also awesome. They have a lot of great fun songs that are catchy and get stuck in your head even years later trust me. Elton John also composed some awesome original music for the film so it also has a romantic and love context within the film as well. It is a great film to say the least and the story is very powerful making it a must watch for kids and adults.	10
 The Lion King... more than just a cartoon!	"Just watched this movie, and I can't believe how good it was. At first when I saw the music and all the poetry i sad ""man, this won't be good"". How wrong was I.This movie is a story of Simba's character, and the way he became a full grown man although in the beginning He was just a naughty little lion. And the great thing about this movie is that you can learn so much from it, about family relationships and how to find your way in the society.Great movie again... fun to watch especially when Timon & Pumba showed up. Maybe the film was a little bit short, just an hour and a half but overall great movie. 10/10!"	10
 Long Live the King		10
 My second favourite movie of all time after Tangled	What can I say I love The Lion King. From the opening scenes of the sunrise of the African Plains, to the ending this film is brilliant. The story is about a young cub named Simba who's next in line to be King of Pride Rock after his father.But tragically his father gets killed by stampedes by his father's evil brother Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons)who wants to take over as King Of Pride Rock. Simba runs away only to meet up with two hilarious sidekicks Timon and Pumbaa. They of course tell Simba that his got to put the past behind him and move on with life. As he gets older(now voiced by Matthew Broderick) he meets with his former friend Nala(voiced by Moira Kelly)who is shocked to discover that Simba is next in line to become King.Overall what do I think of this movie well at the age of 22 this movie NEVER fails to make me cry(this was the first ever Disney movie in history to make me cry,the second is Tangled which is hands down my all time favourite movie ever) and to this day TLK never gets old even though its 17 years old its still to this day my 2nd favourite movie of all time. Beautiful Animation,excellent voice cast,brilliant story(even though some people say its a rip off of Hamlet,yeah who gives a hoot). Overall im giving this a solid 10/10	10
 Cool	A good movie magical epic and a dad dies Which is an old musical movie with talking animals and singing animals which I love great voice actors and actress and love it great job amazing art work great writing and a good job.I love Disney movies which is that and love animals and movies and it is a pretty movie great artwork and it's over 10 years old which is good for a movie of it's time the early 90's plus the lions are great and the worthog and the other animal rocks there so funny and I loved seeing as a kid and soon maybe as an adult in my saying so other Disney movies are good too but this is cool and cute and nice greatjob of Disney too make a good movie for too enjoy for years too come.	
 Few Words and Thanks	Lion King is an epic, must watch animation with such pure thematic and story. It's breath taking, soul giving, motivated... Definitively the only and the best animation for all ages. I would Vote 20/10 if I could and I have to indefinitely say thanks and great respect to the authors and all team crew who managed it to produce it.We can found ourselves in every character and we can identify ourselves through complete story. Movie teaches us and remind us about simplicity of the life, life connection, love, family friendship and I recommend that we all need to watch it at least 2 times a year because it makes us better people.	10
 Disney's Pinnacle	I've seen a lot of Disney lately. My daughter has made sure of that. I've seen 101 Dalmations, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, Ratatouille, Up, The Princess and the Frog, Meet the Robinsons, all the Toy Stories, The Little Mermaid, Mulan, and probably more, several times over.They are all good films, with some being better than others. Some you simply associate with classic Disney, others not so much.The Lion King however, is a class of its own.When I first saw the trailer as a kid I was captivated. When I saw the film for the first time it was an incredible, beautiful journey, and even now the film still holds incredible power. It is, to me, Disney at the height of their powers, the very peak of their work.The story is effectively Hamlet but it's executed so well, with such passion and love and beauty. The characters are timeless (especially Timon and Pumba!). It's hard to believe most of the animators of the time were rushing to work on Pochahontas- how many of them now wish they'd stuck to The Lion King?	9
 one of the best Disney animated movie !	I watched the film few days ago and though to write a little review for this movie. This Disney film is one of classic story which i heard in my childhood and now here comes that story in excellent animated movie. and as i believe all of these Disney movies gives us an message about friendship , love , unity and all,when talking about the graphics in this move i can give 10/10 for that. simple and neet even all those animations are good :)I love how Disney Works hard to deliver the best in Animation,Song,And Magic.Thank You	8
 Great, timeless masterpiece		10
 My take on The Lion King	I remember when this movie first came out in 1994 and I first saw it in theaters and I enjoyed it. This movie makes sense to me every time I have watched it. It has great character and story development. This movie was a facet of my childhood along with Fern Gully and Toy Story. I felt for Timon and Pumbaa ever since I first watched this movie in theaters in 1994. The hyenas were mean to Timon and I used to hate the hyenas for it. This movie is about taking responsibility and that is the moral of the film. I also learned not to worry too much from Hakuna Matata and I have a tendency to worry about things that I like a lot. This movie is not my #1 childhood favorite, but I liked it.	8
 The Lion King is literally the greatest animation film along with Toy Story!	"I have often seen 'The Lion King' as a child at school but have never, since then, had the privilege to see this masterpiece. Today, I decided: ""What the hey! I need to see this!"" and so, I DID! And boy...its the best choice I made all year! Everyone knows the plot to Lion King but for any who don't, here it is: Simba as a cub grows up with Mufasa and is told one day that he will be the next king. When word reaches Simba's uncle, Scar, he isn't very pleased as you would expect to and plots the deaths of Simba and Musafa so that he may rule 'Pride Rock' Escaping Musafa and death, Simba then grows up to be a pretty much nobody until his old friend, Nala comes back and tells him that he must be ready to be king. The story simply evolves around Simba's life.This film is just an animation masterpiece. Not only a genre masterpiece, but a masterpiece in general. The voice acting for this movie was superb. Jeremy Irons as Scar was amazing, Mathew Brodrick as old Simba was fantastic both delivering the performances of their lives. The animations, to this day, look amazing, the music is breath taking,the songs are so amazing and iconic that it is impossible to possibly ignore any of these aspects. The film is superbly directed and the dialogue is great.The characters were done so amazingly in this movie. All the characters were interesting. Until Disney classics, like, say 'Beauty and the Beast' there wasn't a character that I didn't truly care for.Overall, 'The Lion King' is quite possibly the greatest animation film and one of the greatest films ever made that gets everything right. Truly an entertaining, an unforgettable classic!"	10
 Best Children's Movie	This movie was and is my favorite Disney movie. A timeless classic.The best part about this movie, I feel, was the musical score. Circle of Life, Hakuna, and Can You Feel, are great songs - so melodic and memorable that I remember the tunes and lyrics to this date.Overall, I felt this was a story about what we all often do: Running away from problems. But in the end, also as we should do, Simba turns around to face them. This inspires me still, and most definitely inspired me when I was a child.The reunification scene with the baboon was one of the most hilarious scenes I've seen in a children's movie while at the same time being deep and about facing your problems and not running away from the past.Finally, I believe the themes of facing your problems and the unification of all life are universal deep themes that are told perfectly well in this movie.	
 Perhaps The First Movie I Ever Laid Eyes on		10
 one of the best movies in the 90's	The Lion King was one of the first movies I've seen as a child other than Cinderella. I think it's a perfect film for all ages. Here's why... 1)It teaches you life lessons- when mufasa teaches young simba about the circle of life, it's probably one of the most important scenes out of any movie I saw. it plays a role that sets up how Mufasa rules his kingdom (respect for all) and Scar (well let's kill our dinner and destroy the circle of life). Hakuna Matata is wayy better than YOLO & if something's bad happens, I use this motto to cheer me up. You don't see good life lessons in modern animated movies (well not up and PotF) 2)The score is FANTASTIC! it's just as good as hunchback and way better than aladdin (I love that movie). The songs are amazing and they stay true to the themes and the culture of Africa 3)Mufasa- he's the Atticus Finch of Disney. They respect everyone no matter if they are different from them. they could probably be best friends! 4)Scar- GREATEST Disney VILLAIN EVER!! Like who would actually succeed for a long time besides Frollo from HOND?? Nearly no one. And scar actually kills someone! 5)People say this is a violent movie. umm not really except when simba & scar fight 6)The animation is flawless. It's not messy or overdone; has great contrast and tone & the characters are well drawn I could ramble on about this, but I shouldn't. this IS the definition of a 90's movie. I can see why it's so successful & that most of us adore this movie. This movie never disappoints! Just sit down, use the VHS player, and enjoy this classic!	10
 I have a crush on Shenzi...	This movie is just awesome. And yes, I have a crush on Shenzi(she's animated, it doesn't count as creepy). Why? Cos she's the prettiest looking animated character I have ever seen. And hyenas are also my favourite animals, btw. Ever since this movie. Great plot, fantastic characters(the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa). Great, great, great, great. Also, one thing: Simba's just an ordinary lion cub so... HOW COME HE IS THE BEST SINGER I'VE EVER HEARD??!??!?!?Scar's song was of course genius. The Hyena March was great to watch. Wish they'd added in the Be Prepared reprise. Simba is adorable of course. And Zazu got played by the ever-sarcastic Blackadder!! Or mr. Bean as he's also known.	10
 A Timeless Classic	The Lion King; another timeless classic by Disney. The heartwarming story of Simba will never escape our hearts. The Lion King is the story of Simba, a young cub whose trying to find his place in the world after the death of his father, Mustafa. This story is full of hidden meanings, emotions, metaphors and analogies that each person could take away something different from each viewing. It's hard to find flaws in such a work of art but the way that Disney rehashes scenes from other Disney movies is definitely one of them. They don't take away from the experience of the movie but it's something that a movie veteran could definitely notice.	10
 The True Essence of Disney....	The Lion King must rate as the greatest of all Disney's in the modern era - state of the art animation, powerful story, exemplary voice casting and superb music and songs.One for all ages, from 1 to 101, but with enough bite and comedy for adults and questioning older children, too. One that can be seen at any time, over and again.Essential family viewing. Perfect. My standard DVD's of great picture quality and sound and came with a booklet, which turned out to feature special Disney offers. Well, never mind, they're one of the better big brands!	9
 The Lion King		10
 Can you feel the love tonight - YES OF COURSE	The Lion King is widely regarded as the greatest Disney movie of all time and is very worthy of its title; with its breathtaking score, lovable characters and a fantastic, moving plot. It has a bunch of spectacular songs, such as The Circle of Life and Can you feel the Love Tonight and Hakuna Mattata which make this film even better. However, the story and characters are what make this film a timeless classic - the tear jerking story with its amazingly funny scenes are adorable and everyone loves it. The characters are so well developed that you can never forget them! The Lion King is absolutely spectacular and has everything makes Disney movies unforgettable. It has humour, romance, action, sadness and some of the most iconic moments of movie history! The beautiful, youthful graphics accompanied by the amazing soundtrack makes this a fantastically splendid movie experience for old and young. The Lion King is one of the greatest Disney movies of all time......... No, actually, one of the best movies of all time and I don't know how anybody could not fall in love with this epic film!	10
 The Lion King		8
 Pretty Good, but it has a few flaws.	"The Lion King seems to be the Disney animated movie that everyone absolutely loves. It is a movie that is absolutely perfect and can't be touched, there is simply nothing wrong with it. Now I actually didn't grow up with this film, I remember watching it once when I was little, and then the next time I remember seeing it was when I was seventeen. So do I like this film? Yes, I think it's a pretty damn good film, but it isn't my favorite animated movie of all time.First, the animation is absolutely beautiful. This has to be some of the best 2D animation in the history of animation. The colors are bright and vibrant, and every aspect has detail. On a technical level this film is a masterpiece. But there is more to this film that works than just animation. The characters are likable too. The relationship between Mufasa and Simba feels like a real father-son relationship, and you feel sad when Mufasa dies. The villain is great in the first half, he's so great at being bad, and he's funny too. The romance feels genuine, and some of the songs are fantastic, my personal favorite being ""I just can't Wait to be King."" Now for some downsides, despite a lot of time given to the development of Simba's father, I can't even remember his mom's name. And while Scar was great in the first half, in the last half, he sort of became just a spoiled brat, which is pretty much what Simba was in the first half, Scar just became kind of bland. And Timon and Pumbaa are half and half with me personally, sometimes their funny, sometimes their just annoying.There are a few other small nitpicks, but overall, this is a really good movie. It has great animation, great songs, a good message, and interesting characters, for the most part. And it does make me laugh at times. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it's still a really good film."	8
 One of Disney's Best!	The Lion King is truly a Disney classic and it's going to stay like that forever and ever.The first time I say this movie I was completely blown away, at how great something can be.Every character is great in this movie.I have seen this movie so many times,that I enjoy it more every time I see it.This movie is in my Top 10 favorite cartoons of all-time.This and Aladdin are the two greatest animation movies ever. I have two copies of the DVD. This movie is going to be remembered forever by People around the world.A must have for your collection.	9
 The King of Disney Animation	This movie represents Disney; it is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the best animated film ever made. Basically put, 'The Lion King' follows the adventures of Simba, a young lion who struggles to find his place in nature's 'circle of life'. His evil and greedy uncle, Scar, tricks Simba into thinking he killed his father and the young cub is forced to flee from his home and live a carefree life, away from all responsibility. But as he matures into a young adult, destiny calls him and Simba must confront his past in order to save his home and become the Lion King of the Pride Lands. What makes this movie so great is the timeless story, stunning animation and music that cannot be put into simple words. It is full of humor, warmth, and teaches many vital life lessons, which makes it great for kids. Seriously, if you are among the very few who haven't seen The Lion King, I suggest you see it and buy a copy of it while it is out of the Disney Vault. Simply put - this film is a treasure that is not to missed.	10

 The coming of a King		9
 The Lion King - A Majestic Masterpiece	"Animation movies have easy, but yet so hard premises to follow - it's got to be an easy story which children are supposed to manage to follow without problems, and it's got to be a positive message from it, too. Most animated movies have problems to follow those codes and at the same time recreate that guidelines into an interesting product. But ""The Lion King"" isn't one of those - it is an interesting story which will engage the whole family.The young lion cub Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is prince of the kingdom of Pride Rock, but is naturally a little too naive and curious for his own good. The clever, power sick and evil Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons), who naturally wants the throne, is of course fast to recognize that. He works out a plan which succeeds - a plan which leads to king Mufasa's (voiced by James Earl Jones) death, and forces the scared Simba to flee the kingdom into exile, leaving his destiny as the king in the great Circle of Life. Scar becomes king and destroys Pride Rock by letting the lions and hyenas live together in so called ""harmony"". Simba is found by two highly eccentric creatures - minx Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and boar Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella).Several years later, the older Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is still located in the jungle with his two friends, and is now a wild lion who lives of eating creeps living underneath rocks and has completely dislodged his past. But one day, Simba's best friend from Pride Rock, Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly), accidentally finds the three of them in her chase for hope. After reuniting with Nala, Simba realizes that it was a mistake to flee from his kingdom, and decides to return and thereby face his past. But it is too late to rebuild the destroyed Pride Rock to the idyllic kingdom it once was?Yes, the plot is simple (and somehow borrowed from the classic Hamlet story) - a prince who is dethroned, flees, and thereafter returns to take it back and thereby save the kingdom. Yes, it is a cliché inspired message - to run from the past doesn't change anything and all that stuff. But then there's the most important thing - to create a main character which we as an attendance care for, and there's where The Lion King scores the most. Because, who doesn't care for Simba, a naive prince who was forced to flee from his own land, tried to forget his past, but still has the scars from it, never managing to entirely forget? You just HAVE to care for such a character, whether you want to or not, because most of us can somehow relate to his feelings.You know how the story is going to end already before you even watch it. But still, we catch ourselves to get engaged in Simba's battle against time to find courage to once and for all meet his past. We get touched by the traditional love story between two childhood friends who casually meet again several years later. We cheer for the hero in his obligatory battle against his arch enemy. The story is really simple, but yet so genius.I also have to praise the technical achievements in the movie. The animation is excellent (ah, the times where they actually DREW the animation pictures!), and I felt like I was in the story through the whole movie. The music is perfect for the story, it really gets us in the right mood.The voice acting are also outstanding - especially the sophisticated bad guy (Irons), the indoctrinating father (Jones), the loyal, old school servant (Atkinson) and the funny annoying hyenas (Goldberg, Marin, and Cummings) are perfectly cast. But also the optimistic Sabella, the charming presumptuous Lane, and the believably depressed Broderick gives delightful impressions, even though the acting performances of course is second in line in such a movie. But point is, with so many enjoyable characters, a movie has to succeed. The key lies in story and characters, the rest of it comes almost automatically.All in all, The Lion King isn't just among the best animated stories of all time, in my opinion. It's also among the best movies overall. Two thumbs up, and a well deserved 9/10 for this classic. The movie lives up to its name - it really IS majestic!"	9
 The best animated film of all time.	This film is fantastic, Having brilliant animation perfect voice acting, with each actor fitting in to their role perfectly. The Sound track is one of the best of all time, Be Prepared is a fantastic villain song, Circle of life is a very powerful song and Can You Feel The Love Tonight is arguably the best song in the film, easily deserved all the the awards it one being highly emotional as well as written perfectly, Elton John did a brilliant job with the music and Tim Rices lyric match the music perfectly Han Zimmers score was also very well done. It is based off of Shakespeares Hamlet, This film for the most part is not a comedy Timon and Pumbaa do bring some comedy in to it but the rest of the film is Very sad, Dramatic, and highly emotional from the death of Mufasa to the reunion of Simba and Nala. Overall this film is a true Disney masterpiece.	10
 The best Disney film out there		10
 The Lion King became the ruler of Disney's vast jungle, far outgrossing any of the studio's previous releases.	Upon the death of his father, the Lion King, a young cub is exiled from the jungle by his wicked uncle, who plans to ascend to the throne himself.The Lion King is reliably entertaining Disney animation that provides grown-up drama - loosely based on the plot of Hamlet - and, for light relief, excellent comic sidekicks and some memorable songs. The film still holds the record as the highest grossing traditionally animated film in history and belongs to an era known as the Disney Renaissance. Certain elements of the film bear a resemblance to a famous 1960s Japanese anime television show, Kimba The White Lion.	8
 The King of 90s' Disney Animation		10
 A Crowning Achievement for Disney	"From the amazing sunrise for Simba's birth to the incredible and breathtaking climax, Disney's The Lion King is not just an amazing animated film, it is one of the greatest movies ever made! It is the story of a young lion cub named Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas from ""Home Improvement"") who is destined and ""Just Can't Wait to be King"" of the jungle. After his father and king at the time Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones from ""Star Wars"", ""Field of Dreams""), is thrown into a wild stampede of wildebeests and killed by his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons from ""The Time Machine""), Simba is thrown into exile by him and believed to have been killed by the hyenas. Then, he meets two hilarious characters that provide the comic relief to this dark film; a zany meerkat named Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane from ""Mouse Hunt"") and his kind warthog companion named Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and he adopts the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, while forgetting his true destiny; go back to Pride Rock, defeat Scar and restore the Circle of Life. Along the way, he reunites with childhood friend Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly) and meets a wise old baboon named Rafiki (voiced by Robert Guillame) that remind him of his true destiny and leads to one of the greatest climaxes you will see in any film. The Lion King has everything an animated feature should have: great story, nice songs, dynamic music score, amazing animation, memorable characters (my favorite is Pumbaa), an edge of your seat ending, and a life lesson that anyone can apply to their life. This movie also has in my opinion the best voice cast for any animated film. Lion King is a film that everyone should see and own for you and your family to enjoy (I still have my VHS Copy of the film). Not my favorite animated film (the honor goes to ""A Goofy Movie"") but definitely in the top 5! Rating: A roaring 10/10!"	10
 still great after all those years		10
 Best Disney animated Film	"Lion King is ,in my opinion, one of the best movies ever made by Disney. I was just blown away by it. This was my favorite movie when I was like 8, and now I watch it over and over again but it never gets old. It had wonderful songs of the respected singer/ composer Elton Johnthat many of us may still know. There are also some moral values in it like respect, faith and acceptance of responsibility. It also shows the importance of family, friendship and love. This is a family movie that anyone would love and appreciate since it is funny and at the same time it made me cry at a lot of moments in which I'm not gonna spoil to you.It's just the magic of the circle of life ruled by our one and only ""Simba!"""	10
 My All Time Favorite Disney Film!!	"For so many years, this movie has held a very very special spot in my heart. It wasn't until I had found the movie on Youtube after nearly 8 or 9 years that I finally felt a massive force of good memories come rushing back into me.To make a long story short, I love this movie, and I'm always glad to see how well recognized it is in the film world. As a child, like with a lot of Disney films, I didn't ever notice some of the deeper details in the storytelling, specifically, the connections to Shakespeare's Hamlet.This movie had a wonderful story, a multitude of memorable characters, amazing songs (although what else could one expect from Elton John?) and an overall theme that can entertain both children and adults.Roger Ebert once commented that ""Villains are some of the most memorable characters in a Disney film"". This is very true, especially when you see Scar, voiced very ingeniously by the brilliant Jeremy Irons. Scar is everything a villain should be: cool, calm, collected, devious, and conniving. In short, a villain needs to use his or her words to their advantage, not mindless violence like a slasher film villain.Another notable aspect that makes this film stand out, is that it contains one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in film history. Even at the age of 17, nothing has changed. The scene where the lion cub Simba finds his father dead on the ground, and tries to wake him up (fitted with a very sad score by the amazing Hans Zimmer) made me cry when I was a small child, and it still does even at this bitter age. Nothing hurts worse than a child to lose a loved one, without ever having grasped the concept of death.And of course, this movie would probably have been a little too dark, if it didn't have one of Disney's most beloved comedy relief duos ever: the wisecracking meerkat, Timon (voiced by the hilarious Nathan Lane) and his dimwitted warthog com padre, Pumbaa (also done very well by Ernie Sabella.) Clearly, they have been immortalized in the hearts of young children everywhere when the film was new, just as the film itself has.All in all, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in modern film history, and for those that want to visit a better time through this movie, and for those that ave miraculously never seen it, I seriously recommend it to all."	10
 Disney's toughest but most important picture		9
 Guaranteed smiles!	My absolute favorite movie. I watched it several times as a child and still love it the same way i used to . I believe this movie can brighten your mood. It also has good morals and life lessons throughout the movie. Excellent movie , hilarious! It makes me cry from laughter and in some scenes from sadness. It is an excellent movie for both young and old. I recommend to anyone that you get this movie out. wipe the dust off and watch it. Guaranteed smile!Even the villains of the film are hilarious. Im also not one for musical type things but the songs in the movie are just so catchy!! It is truly the best movie i even watched and my favorite movie EVER EVER!	10
 Best Disney movie EVER!!!!!!		10
 truly a masterpiece	The lion king has always been one of my favorite animated films and after watching it again after more than a decade, I believe it always will be. A wonderful story about a young lion cub racked with guilt over his father's death, who runs away to escape the torment but ultimately overcomes it and resumes his place in the Great Circle Of Life. It is the struggles of Simba that make this a great movie, such as the love he has for his father, the sadness he feels from his death and the need to escape painful memories, the ultimate realization that you can't hide away forever, that life moves on and you must move with it and do what you know is right. Deep moral lessons are something lacking in today's films, especially those intended for children, and that is why TLK has had a lasting impression on movie viewers. This coupled with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful visual design makes The Lion King a timeless classic, and one I'd recommend to anyone, including adults. Definitely worth watching.	10
 The Lion King	"The Lion King The Lion King is a spectacular movie. It teaches a valuable lesson. There is a lion cub born, named Simba. The father's name is Mufassa. When Simba is still just a cub his father is killed in a stampede. His uncle Scar makes Simba believe that it was his fault. Then Scar tells Simba that he needs to run away and never come back. So simba runs away, and Scar sends some hyenas after Simba to kill him. Simba gets away from them, of course. Simba meets Timone and Puumba who take care of him. Simba grows up and meets an old baboon named Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that he knows his father. Simba doesn't believe him because his father is dead. There is a scene where the clouds take the shape of Simba's father and it says to him ""In forgetting me you have forgotten who you are."" Or something along those lines. After that Simba meets Nala, one of his old friends. She asks him to come back to Pride Rock with her. He says no. This movie is appropriate for all age groups. I really enjoy watching this movie. If you haven't already seen this movie, I would recommend that you rent the movie and watch it. Fenna Marsh"	9
 The Greatest Animated Film	"When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive. The animation is stunning, and I thought the voice actors were all cast perfectly - especially Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, as well as Jeremy Irons as Scar. I know the quintessential tearjerking part is when Mufasa dies, but the part that always gets to me is at the end when Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and looks up into the clouds and hears his father say ""Remember..."" It gets to me every time! All in all,I was very impressed with the DVD version.I especially love the voice talents of Matthew Broderick,Jonathan Taylor Thomas,Jeremy Irons,Whoopi Goldberg,Rowan Atkinson,and many others. Great job!"	9
 The lion king is the king of the 90's		10
 Excellent		9
 Another excellent effort from Disney in the '90s!		9
 Love this movie!		9
 Could Disney even do this again?		10
 Wonderful Movie	"Lion King is one of most best movies of all time.i really like this animation and a lot of my friends too.i recommend this movie to you especially for young girls,they love this movie for sure. Simba was a very cute person and Nala too.this is timeless movie. A young lion prince is born in Africa,thus making his uncle Scar the second in line to the throne. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill King Mufasa and Prince Simba, thus making himself King. The King is killed and Simba is led to believe by Scar that it was his fault, and so flees the kingdom in shame. After years of exile he is persuaded to return home to overthrow the usurper and claim the kingdom as his own thus completing the ""Circle of Life""."	8
 Last of the epic Disneys	A super film, up there with Disney's finest, and, like all the best movies, great for young and old alike.Some tragedy, comedy, 'rite of passage', suspense, and with one of the truly great opening sequences of any film, whether real life or cartoon, this is terrific stuff.The characters are well fleshed out and the detail in the foliage and fauna, landscape etc.is absolutely awesome. The 'feel' gleaned, particularly from ensemble scenes, is often as if one is in the thick of the action. I rate The Lion King second only to The Jungle Book in the Disney canon (and it's a close call).Recommended to all.	9
 My first time		10
 Super flick	"I thoroughly enjoyed the film (even if I am in my 60s). I would recommend the film to all.The acting coupled with the voice-overs and the music are simply terrific. I talked my grandchildren into seeing the flick. Of course, after that I had to buy them TLK stuff.Little Piece of Trivia: As an aside, there is one scene where Scar, in response to a question from Simba, answers ""...you have no idea."" (or something like that). Anyway, Jeremy Irons in the movie ""Reversal of Fortune"" make the same answer that Scar does, in the same voice, when responding to the statement that he is strange (or the like). Check it out. The first time I saw ""The Lion King"" I laughed out loud."	9
 Disney's greatest achievement	"In the early 1990s Disney hit a revival in animation starting with The Little Mermaid, followed by the only animated best picture nominee, Beauty and the Beast, and reaching its peak in 1994. The Lion King was a marvelous achievement in animation and a worldwide phenomenon that remains to this day the greatest Disney animated film of all time.The story is about a young lion cub, Simba, the only son of Mufasa, the king. His uncle, Scar, is jealous and greedy, and wants the throne for himself. In a Hamlet-like turn of events Scar kills Mufasa and takes over the kingdom as Simba is forced to live in exile. Simba must find his place in the world and let go of the past in order to regain the Pridelands from his evil uncle.One of the highlights of any Disney movie is the music, and the Lion King is no different. Hans Zimmer won an Oscar for the background score, which is lively and exciting, obviously with some African influence. Tim Rice and Elton John wrote the songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" also won the movie an Oscar, while two other songs were nominated. The voice work is fantastic. James Earl Jones provides authority and command for the king, Mufasa. Jeremy Irons plays the perfect villain, and also gets to show off his singing chops.The animation comes to life in a way that is not just entertainment for the kids as so many animated movies are, but a real piece of art that anyone can enjoy. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll have the time of your life watching The Lion King."	10
 This movie is a must see classic	This movie is one of my absolute favorites. It has the making of a great movie with good music,a variety of characters, and a talented cast. Hats off for Disney in this film. It's about a lion who loses his father and thinks it his fault. Even though it is really the fault of his treacherous uncle Scar. He runs away and meets Timone and Pumbaa, your classic comic relief. He grows up with them until an old friend (Nala) shows up and demands he returns to be king. He falls in love with her and debates with himself if he should return to Pride Rock to take over as King or not. Eventually through a series of strange events he does (rafiki a crazy baboon has a lot to do with that). And returns home to battle Scar. Scar convinces the pack that Simba murdered his father. Then they battle. Just as Scar is about to kill Simba he reveals he is the true murderer of Mufasa (Simba's father). With new found strength Simba jumps up and tackles Scar and forces him to admit to his crime. Then Simba takes his rightful place as King of Pride Rock.	10
 What a great movie	"This movie is quite amazing. The songs are great, the story is great, everything is great. This movie is both for four year olds and even adults. As a matter of fact, I would recommend seeing it both AS a four year old and as an adult. I remember seeing this when I was young and thinking ""Look at the pretty lions,"" and ""I love this song,"" and ""Scar's a meany."" But now, when I watch, I truly understand the depth of the story, and the humorous parts as well. It is not a laugh out loud movie, but it is definitely humorous, with lots of little jokes thrown in, such as when Zazu offers to sing It's a Small World and Scar implores him not to. James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, JTT, basically everyone was great. Jeremy Irons was superb. This sycophant role was one he was born to play. Whoopi Goldberg is also very funny, and Cheech Marin puts on an underrated performance. Nathan Lane being a secondary character is great as well for a few laughs. In conclusion, this movie is the bomb. The music, scenes, morals, story, everything's great."	10
 My Love of The Lion King and SCAR!	The Lion King is the first movie I recall seeing when I was little. It made me cry and laugh and gasp. I immediately fell in love with Pumbaa (what little kid didn't?!) and the entire movie itself just moved me. This is definitely one of Disney's most classic movies. It is, however, extremely over-hyped. The beauty of this movie is astounding, and since so many people have fallen in love with it like I have it has become a movie Disney lovers either exalt or smite. There is no meat on the Lion King sandwich. You either love it or hate it. I, personally, love it. I used to love to sing with all the songs from The Lion King when I was young. Scar always has been and always will be on of my favorite Disney villains. He is cunning and cold in a downright sexy way! All in all.... this movie has everything. Emotion, dedication, romance, drama... I love the Lion King with all my heart!	9
 The most Epic Disney film of all time	"No matter what I try and say here it will all end the same way. ""The Lion King"" is the most beautiful and epic film Disney have ever made. Looking past the fact this was aimed at children (as Disney does) the story is one that could have been easily aimed at an older audience.The plot focus' around Simba. A young lion cub destined to become king of the Pride Lands. He is happy and adventurous and can't wait to fulfil his role in the future. But things are never so rosy, especially when the clichéd evil Uncle (aka Scar) murders Simba's father, Mufasa and convinces Simba that its his fault and should run away (although Scar wants him dead just to make sure). What unfolds from this is a tale of adventure, friendship, torment, humour, love, responsibility and a full scale war to determine who will be king once and for all. Replace the lions with people and this could easily have been a 12. It's a tale that anyone can enjoy. I've loved it since i saw it in 1994 when I was 7.The actors who star in ""The Lion King"" sure know how to do their job. They bring the characters to life in a way that seems special as well as real. Personally I don't think the acting has been anywhere near as perfect as this has in an animated movie. Matthew Broderick as an adult Simba especially. The way he conveys the feelings of anguish and guilt out of his character really hit home.The soundtrack is probably one of the biggest reasons I love this film. Hans Zimmer's score fits every scene magnificently. It is what gave that feeling of an epic more than anything else. During the tragedy of Mufasa's death the score actually had tears in my eyes. OK I may have been 7 but even today i have to make an effort not to drop a tear. And the final piece where Simba heads to the peak of Pride Rock to take his place as King just had me with my jaw on the floor.So overall. An epic masterpiece suitable for all. I'm off out now to buy the DVD and watch it again :D"	10
 1994 Work of Art {Lion King}	1994 saw the best Walt Disney movie of our time, The Lion King not only was it Disney's 32nd classic animation, it was also an Academy Award winner, and this great family movie will be remembered for an eternity. And it is understandable why many people still rave about it today. A storey that's so hard hitting you'll be struggling to hold back at least one tear, songs for your children to giggle to, and also not forgetting the characters and there humorous moments. A film where the whole family can sit down on the sofa and have a good night in, so what are you waiting for? Get yourself a copy of this work of art, today! 10/10	10
 The best movie ever, and for reason.	Without doubt my favorite movie ever. Beautifully made, voice actors are just perfect (in the Finnish version) and the most important thing: the story is good. It's about facing your past and taking your place in life. And this little thing that still is important: the music. Hans Zimmer is definitely my favorite composer, and in The Lion King I always remember why. The mere music makes me cry, and add the movie itself: I'm crying my eyes off. I'm stunned that average rating for this movie in IMDb is only 7,8 out of 10. This movie is worth so much more. I have liked this movie ever since I saw it when I was a kid, but the older I become, the more I love it. I don't know a single person who haven't loved this movie once they've seen it. And that doesn't surprise me at all, Lion King is too touching to be ignored.	10
 I Love it!	The Lion King is a great film and I absolutely love it. Along with a a superb plot, terrific animation, a star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a slightly rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honour and most importantly friendship.I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen, even including such films as the jungle book and Pinocchio. Which are a part of the great Disney pantheon. But they really got back their magic with this film though, although they have now reverted to go going back to clichéd films again.It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will always remember and show to my children.	
 The King of Disney		10
 The best animated film ever?	This is probably the best animated film of all time. The characters are endearing and the music is first class. The film is the ultimate in children's entertainment. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters of Simba, Timon and Puumba and Rafiki. You will find your self willing the characters on and being totally engrossed by the narrative as it takes you on a beautiful journey through the African savanna. Jeremy Irons is perfect as the villain Scar and the showdown between Scar and Simba is one of the best finales to a Disney film ever. This film is definitely one of the classics and is a must for all film lovers.	10
 How is this not on the top 250?		10
 Dear old Lion King	"This picture is my ultimate love.I wish there'd be a vote of 1000 so I could give it to LK. I *tried* to see it in the cinema when it first came out-I was four-and I was scared to death by the darkness of the stairs that lead to the theater.My attempt to watch it failed... Then I grew older,and I watch it so many times I can't remember.No movie,be an animation or not,never placed it's space in my heart.I can't begin to describe the emotions that fill my heart when I hear the words ""Lion King"".I've never bothered to watch 2&3,because I don't want its magic to disappear. Dear Simba,Nala,Scar,probably one of the best bad men in the history, the noble King Mufasa,the Circle of Life,greatest soundtrack ever...What can I say...A breathtaking journey into the worlds of love,nobility,fantasy and faith..."	10
 An Animated Masterpiece! No question!!!	My parents brought me a video of the Lion King and I first watched it when I was 3. Although I couldn't understand the plot, I loved the songs and the characters looked cute.As I grew up, I got addicted to the movie. I watched it every weekend and I never got tired of it. It was simply the best movie I've ever watched in my life. It hits the full criteria of a 'perfect movie'. Excellent animation, characters, chemistry, plot, dialog, voice cast and music. It's funny, dramatic, sad, full of action and has a bit of romance in it too.People say it's for kids but it can teach adults a valuable lesson about taking their kids to the right path and finding their place in the 'Circle of Life'. I always get that tingly feeling at the end of the movie.Well done, Disney, you have made a lot of good movies but this one definitely is the king!!! A 7 star film I would rate this.	10
 Emotional, dramatic, and by far the most excellent 2D animated movie of all time.	I have been a fan of The Lion King since the year before it was released in theatres. I was but a mere child at the age of 13, however, I was so enthusiastic about this movie. The music, the animation, the drama, the raw emotion. Everything within this movie was something to truly behold. Sometimes it'll jerk a few tears, other times you will be filled with glee and excitement. Because of the success of this movie, many Lion King-based communities have been erected in honour of this masterpiece of Walt Disney. I recommend this movie to the entire family, from young children to the elderly. There isn't anything in this movie that you could possibly dislike. :)There are, however, very slight artistic errors, but these do not affect the movie æsthetics at all.	10
 A Disney Masterpiece!	"A young lion cub named Simba is told by his father Mufasa that he will be king after Mufasa dies. Mufasa's evil brother Scar wants to be king himself, so, with the help of his three hyena henchmen, causes a wildebeest stampede to kill him. Scar then tells Simba that he was responsible for Mufasa's death, and that he must run away and never come back to the kingdom. Simba runs away and meets meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa. He decides to stay with them for a long lazy life. When a childhood friend, Nala, tells him that Scar is ruining the Pride Lands, Simba returns to battle Scar and gain his place as king.THE LION KING is considered to be one of Disney's best. It became one of Disney's money-making films. KING contains wonderful voice talent, with Matthew Broderick as Simba, James Earl Jones as Scar, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, Simba's friend, and Whoopi Goldberg as one of the hyenas. It has wonderful songs (including ""The Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", and ""Hakuna Matata""). The animation is incredible, with computer animation at its best in the wildebeest stampede. Those are just some of the things that make THE LION KING a wonderfully entertaining film. KING was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, and was later turned into an excellent Broadway musical. KING was later re-released into IMAX theaters, digitally remastered with a brand new song, ""The Morning Report"". Recommended. 10/10."	10
 Just what Disney fans will like.		9
 Disney at their best		10
 one of the best movies i've ever seen	In my opinion, this is one of Disney's best movies ever! I've known this film since I am five years old (when it got out) and when I was little I loved it, because I thought Timon was great and Simba was a great King, etc...Now, I see so much more in that film. I see friendship, love, hate, drama, and comedy. That movie is a representation of every feeling that we have and it is such a good work....I'm sure that it is one of the best animation movies that will ever be made.If you haven't seen it yet (almost impossible) don't waste more time...You'll love it!	9
 Not Only The Greatest Animated Movie Ever Made, But In My Opinion, The Greatest Movie Ever Made.	"The Lion King, to me, is like no other movie. It's a movie that gets better every time you watch it, and one you never get sick of. A movie you can't stop watching, and one that you wish would not end, it is that good. It's a movie that both adults and kids can enjoy. The kids will enjoy young Simba's adventures and Timone and Pumbaa's jokes. The adults will enjoy those as well, but they will also enjoy the great dramatic Hamlet-like story, the music, and the great voice cast. The Lion King is a phenomenal movie and has something to offer for everyone.The Lion King succeeds on every level. From it's award winning music to it's superb voice cast. Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the score, causing me to have goosebumps at certain points in the movie. Elton John's talent for writing songs really shows in this movie with songs like, ""Can't Wait To Be King"", and Hakuna Ma Tatta."" After you see this movie you'll know why the music was award-winning.Not only is the music good but the voice acting is superb. With James Earl Jones providing a commanding voice for King Mufassa, to Jonathan Taylor Thomas providing a high-pitched eccentric voice for young Simba. Matthew Broderick is excellent as well as adult Simba, and Jeremy Irons provides his devilish voice to the villain Scar fantastically. Rowan Atkinson is great also as the charmed Zazu, and Nathan Lane is hilarious as Timone.The music and voice casting, as I mentioned earlier, aren't the only great parts movie, the plot shines just as bright, maybe even brighter. As I also mentioned before, The Lion King has a Hamlet-like story with a king who has a son that will one day will take over as king and rule the Pride Lands. The king though, has a jealous, mischievous brother who schemes against him in order to obtain the throne by killing the king, and his would-be king son. The son after surviving his uncle's plot to kill him, and after running away from the Pride Lands because he thought his father's death was his fault, must return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful place as King.The movie has plenty of drama, to if not make you spout some tears, at least feel saddened by some elements of the movie. The movie also makes you laugh, and makes you happy. The Lion King even has romance in it, with Simba and his life-long friend Nala. The Lion King is the complete package that gives you everything. It is movie that you will not walk away disappointed from. To me, it's wonder why this isn't in IMDb's top 250, and it's also wonder why this movie didn't win Best Picture."	10
 About the movie	"About the movieGreat animation great history great continuity rich in characters and voice casting outstanding maturity (for being a film for young viewers) the greatest bad guy in film history SCAR!!! (animated or not, any problem with that? I don't give a FU...""Pumba not in front of the kids""!!) I remember that day in 94 being drag to the movie theater by my sister I was just 8 and haven't any idea of what was waiting for me, the very intro blow me away I will remember that chant all my life ""INGONYAMA...""and the circle of life scene will stick for long time too. And immediately later we met with Mr. Scar. that strangely enough he is a very sensual character (I know it sounds strange but is true) his voice and his persona make him sexy he obviously has his own issues but his strange and sort of super educated British ironic personality and his sadistic and almost demonic voice (thanks Jeremy Irons) make him a unique green eyed evil lion (by the way I am black haired green eyed too LOL) be prepared for Scar who cheats poor Simba and drag him to the elephant graveyard (well if you say a kid don't go there and expect them obeying you, dude you have serious mental problems) the amazing ""trama"" turns Simba into an strayed lion because of an incident involving the death of his father (all planed by Scar) that will stick with him for the rest of his days until he is encouraged by the good old fashioned wise guy(ape) Rafiki who shows him the truth about his destiny after a chit chat with his already dead father who pops in front of him (or above?) and with a very deep and profound voice (by James Earl Jones) shows Simba the path he must follow, end Scar's management and take back the throne that by right is his, then returns for claim his kingdom and challenge his uncle (who find his death)(real woozy Simba)After Simba commits his crime...uh-um um I mean ends the menace of his EVIL uncle returns to pride rock brings rain with his growl (Rainmaker) gets the approve of his ghost father in heaven (who was responsible for the Scar's scar I think) fix the mess Scar did exiles the stinky hyenas and rule the pride lands, ""marry"" Nala and take his friends Timon and Pumba who witnessed the born of a new cup Kiara and all ends with the academy award winning song ""Can you feel the love tonight? By Sir Elton John For me Disney could Accept the end of the franchise or tried to make a good sequel (not that crap of LK2 Simba's pride) with the same crew, and cast, only saved by the LK1and a half and LK 3 Hakuna Matata(just some sort of prequels for earn some more good money) in general one of the recent best features from Disney's (or the best in all his history) and is tough to accept that Disney in the present day is not even the half it was in the 40s or even in 60s and being kicked in the ass by DreamWorks so many times; after LK I could definitively say that THE LION KING WAS THE LAST GOOD ANIMATED MOVIE from the studios (except Mulan, Dinosaur and few others that I'll never watch) real shame but is the cruel reality. Another good example of how a good studio screw up all in an awful and catastrophic way: DREAMWORKS, the last good (and for real), hand drawn animated (well half digital movie) was SPIRIT: STALLION OF THE CIMARRON ,the following movies from DW now are 3d for good 4 reasons: lack of patience, talent, money and originality (not to mention greed) nobody wants to make animated films with pencils and paper no more and is a real shame (I was in the business I know what I'm saying) maybe LK could only attracts the melancholic grown ups with open criteria like me that grew with the theme or people that enjoy all types of films and of course some kids that aren't killing cats in the neighborhood or playing grand theft auto on the play station (moms better worry) My rating from 1 to 10: 11 Simply greatSend me anything you may need at Heilmaur(at)hot mail(dot)com Heilmaur(at)gm-ail(dot)comIf you don't agree with me don't worry everybody has right of expressionTHANKS IMDb For the space"	10
 The best animated film of all time!	The lion king was the first movie i cried while watching, i was just seven year old, but i still remember it like it was yesterday. the story, the music and the characters is a masterpiece, every time i watch it i can't help crying. I have seen both the Swedish and the English version and i honestly prefer the Swedish version. The people creating the lion king should be very proud because it touches peoples hearts, makes them get goosebumps. The lion king were supposed to be a b-film and Pocahontas the a-film, man were they wrong. the lion king were a much more bigger success and it's not hard to understand why. the lion king is the best animated movie of all time, no doubt about it!	10
 Probably not fair to say that it went downhill from here for Disney animation but...		9
 best animation ever!!	The movie starts with the birth of simba the lion cub. (this opening sequence has got to be one of the greatest scenes from an animated feature ever put on the silver screen)as the movie progresses a plot is schemed by Mufasa's(simba's dad)brother scar to kill the king(Mufasa)and take over the pride lands.Tricked into thinking that he killed his father, Simba flees the pride lands where he meets Pumba and Timon who show him the ways of life.But its only a matter of time until Simba returns to take his rightful place as king and take revenge for his fathers death.This movie is most certainly for all ages it will make you laugh and cry.This is in my opinion the best animated feature ever.10/10	10
 The Lion King	"When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive.In this film, however, since he wasn't the one singing, I enjoyed them very much. I especially liked the songs, ""I Just can't Wait to be King,"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" (Next sentence is a spoiler.) I also enjoyed Pumbaa and Timon's karate action at Pride Rock.The voice cast is amazing. Jonathan Taylor Thomas as young Simba, Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar; Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. The three hyena, Bezaai, Shenzi, and Ed were voiced by Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings, respectively.The Lion King is a great movie, and is well worth your time.My Score: 10/10."	10
 Disney's best animated film		10
 On My Top 10 List of Favorite Movies Since I was Little	"* The Lion King is one of my most favorable movies. It is one of Disney's greatest and funniest movies. I love the songs like ""i just can't wait to be king"" and "" the circle of life"". * It's really sad how Scare killed his brother just to become king and he blamed it on Simba. Without Scare killing his brother, Simba wouldn't have met Timon and Pumba. I love them. Timon and Pumba are so funny. They make the movie complete. * If you didn't see this, this is a movie that you should must see. Doesn't matter if your a kid or not, but its a cute, funny, cartoon movie. so if you didn't see The Lion King, you must get it and see it. I hope you will enjoy the movie. Once you have seen it, show it to you friends."	10
 One of the best musical	"I don't have any doubts that The Lion King is the best of the animated films. Vocal staff, music score and and story are all amazing. Jeremy Irons and Whoopi Goldberg are the best, but this does not means that the other are no good. The characters are ones of the best ever. Pumbaa is hilarious, and Scar is arguably the best villain ever.But Lion King is a musical, and, in my humble opinion, the best of all of them. Of course, a lot of people disagree with me in this point. The thing is, however, that I just love Elton John. And who does not like ""Can you feel the love tonight""? ""Hakuna Matata"", ""Circle of Life"" are also fantastic. I have a little preference to ""Be prepared"", maybe because is Jeremy Irons, the Scar, who sings it."	10
" ""The greatest animated film ever made"""		10
 A true classic	I saw this movie when i was younger. I remember enjoying it even as a little kid and today I still love it. I watch it with my best friend and we have quoted many lines from the movie. It is so beautifully drawn. the background of the African landscape is breathtaking. The animals are great and drawn in such wonderful detail. The story is told great and it really flowed well. Some lines in the movie are very deep and have a lot of meaning. The story ends with a great moral and it is also enjoyable for children.The story starts as Mufasa, the king, is celebrating his sons birth. All the animals come to see Simba honored. As simba grows up he learns about the good and bad of everything. He is warned not to go to the dark places aka elephant graveyard. but like any young child he goes. he almost gets killed but is saved. we learn that his uncle Scar is trying to have Simba and Mufasa killed do he can be king. Later Simba is caught in a stampede and Mufasa is killed while saving him. Scar convinces simba its all simbas fault and he should run away and never return. Simba does so leaving Scar the king. Soon there home is taken over by Scars followers the hyenas and things get bad. but Simba has found a new life living care free with his new friends Timon and Pumba. He doesn't think twice about his former home until his old friend Nala tuns into him while searching for food. Nala trys to convince him to come back and be king but Simba refuses. Simba comes upon Rafiki the wise monkey who shows him his father. Mufasa appears in the clouds and tells him he needs to go back. During the next scene Rafiki delivers a speech that i use today. About forgetting the past, it may hurt but you learn from it. Anyways Simba goes back and conquerers Scar and tells everyone the truth about what happened to Mufasa. Simba takes over and soon things go back to the way they were. the last seen is Simba and Nala celebrating the birth of there first child the same way simba was celebrated. Thus the Circle Of Life.the movie is a true classic. The songs will be remember and the characters will live in our hearts forever.	9
 this movie is awesome!!! :)	"I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was about maybe 6 or 7. I loved it from then on. The funny thing is that I never got it on VHS. I never really understood it's main message before because I was too young. But now I'm 15 and the pieces come together. If you look at it carefully and study the movie, it is basically telling how we live today. How we tend to lose ourselves and forget who we are. How we forget what we are meant to live for and why we are here in the first place. How we are all equal in this circle of life under one God. This movie has one main message, ""Finding your true self, and discovering where your meant to be"". It's truly an inspiring movie and the soundtrack to it is amazing. The Lion King, in my opinion is one of the best of all time. My birthday is in about a week and I was thinking of getting it on DVD. It's amazing how a simple animated Disney movie can have that deep meaning to it and can have that much of an impact and inspiration on someone."	9
 If you can ignore the fact that it is geared towards children, you will enjoy it, because it's more then a children's flick. It's a film that you will love.		10
 One of the best Disney films	Personally I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney films ever. Its a shame Disney is not that popular today in the 0's (with Shrek and CGI animation taking over the screen- i'm not criticising Shrek its great!) TLK can be seen as a modern day version of Shakespeares' Hamlet. A brother (Scar) kills his king brother (Mufusa), Simba the future king (Hamlet) listens to the advice of his father's spirit. I first saw TLK when I was in primary school at the age of six and it made me cry! I watch it now with my younger sisters and still think its a masterpiece. TLK is a great movie because of the songs and the animation(its more clear bright compared to the older Dinsey classics.) It also has memorable characters with a great cast, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, Matthew Broderick. I do not think its sequels can beat it but they are still good. Timon and Pumbaa light up the screen and its the first Dinsey film to contain more action. (Fight scenes). TLK is my favourite Disney animation as it was of the first films I saw in the cinema, its more personal as I can relate it to my childhood memories. 10/10 for children 9/10 for adults 9/10 for me. Brill	9
 Beautiful Story		8
 MY FAVORITE DISNEY MOVIE!!!	"*May Contain Spoilers*""The Lion King"" is my favorite Disney movie(along with ""Finding Nemo""). I can't find anything to complain about in this movie. I love the songs in this movie, especially ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and the characters are great. Little Simba and Nala are just adorable and Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious.My favorite part of this movie is when Little Simba and Nala sing the song ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"". That part of the movie is great. I also like the part when Simba first meets Timon and Pumbaa. That part is hysterical.Overall I think everyone should see this movie and I couldn't believe it when I read bad comments about this movie. I give this movie 10/10 stars!"	10
 The Pridelands of Disney Feature Animation	"If Walt Disney himself had ever attempted an animated Hamlet, he wouldn't have gotten any better than The Lion King.   Disney Feature Animation richly crafts a morality tale that doesn't seem preachy, yet tells us of how we are all connected in a greater ""Circle of Life.""  A tour-de-force vocal cast includes the amazing voice of James Earl Jones, the ever so human voice of Matthew Broderick, the vicious, sarcastic and calculated voice of Jeremy Irons, and the humourous antics of Nathan Lane.  A fantastic collaboration of superstar songwriter Elton John and veteran lyricist Tim Rice produces some great Disney tunes.  With very likable heroes and villians, attention to mood and detail, and alive without missing a tribal beat of native Africa, The Lion King stands proudly and roars, loudly. Enjoyed by both adult and child, alike, it clearly defines what was once great in animation.  It is truly a masterpiece of filmmaking as well."	9
 A Wonderful Film For ALL Ages!		
 This is a heart-warming Disney film for the whole family to enjoy (SPOILER)	SPOILERI first saw this film at a young age. I loved it. When I saw it again about 6 years later, I got all of the jokes I had missed in my younger days and I enjoyed the film and fully appreciated the superb animation. It is a heart-warming story about a young lion's feelings and actions following the death of his father which was supposedly his fault.The voice cast was well chosen. Jeremy Irons' voice is dark and sounds evil enough and goes perfectly with the evil uncle role he plays. Rowan Atkinson is an excellent hornbill with his English accent emphasising long words and important points.It is very emotional. When Mufassa dies, I cry. When Simba and Nala fall in love I'm really happy. As usual, Disney have outdone themselves with the music in the movie and it appears at the right time. The finale is the best point with the vocals and the orchestra and the feeling of 'Wow'.Timon and Pumbaa light up the screen with their loopy songs and their stupid jokes (that are still funny even for the mature).In conclusion, Disney have obviously put time and effort into making this film a success. Their careful choice of characters, voices and music adds emotion and enjoyment to a film that has a very unbelievable plot. It is the perfect family film.9/10	
 Best Disney Movie EVER!!!	"This movie came out when I was little and I saw it in theaters so many times!!! I loved this movie so much that kids in my class called me ""The Lion King Queen"" no joke.  Mind you, I was in Kindergarten.  This movie touched me like noother!!!  Spoiler* When I saw it the first time I didn't cry when Mufasa died, but now, 10 years later I tear up, even though I know whats happening!!!  This movie is just the greatest movie, words can't describe how great this movie is!!! My favorite characters were the lions, Simba and Nala.  The songs were excellent!!! I love this movie so much I memorized the whole thing, not on purpose, I just watched it that much!  One time I was at home with my baby sitter and wewatched The Lion King,  then she wouldn't let me have cookies because Iwouldn't stop talking the dialog.  All in all, EXCELLENT movie!!! Best of the Best!!!"	10
 Hamlet, Prince of the Savannah	"""The Lion King"" is perhaps the last ""true"" Disney film and the second movie I ever saw in a theatre. I saw very few movies at all as a child and when my parents took me for my birthday one year, I was delighted. Perhaps that is why this movie means as much to me as it does. My love of ""The Lion King"" probably also relates to my passion for literature and enjoyment of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"" on which Lion King was loosely based. A prince alone, commanded by the ghost of his betrayed father, must reclaim his kingdom and set his corrupt uncle straight: perhaps one of the most fascinating of Shakespeare's concepts.Though I am somewhat annoyed by the ""new age"" views presented in ""The Lion King,"" I have always found this film amusing, the music good, and the animation colorful. It was my young niece's favorite movie as she grew up and I hope, with its new DVD release, many more generations of children will be able to enjoy it as I and my family have."	5
 A triumph.	"A symphonic pairing of music and image, a wonderful musical, an endearing story, great fun characters, a stellar cast (best are Jeremy Lions as Scar, Nathan Lane as Timon, with cameos by Whoopi Golberg as a hyena and Rowan Atkinson as the bird) and marvellously directed. A superb film. One of Disney's best. The two best scenes are undoubtedly the herd of wilderbeast scene and Scar's incredible ""Be Prepared"" number, with operatic visuals punctuated with references to Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will.Seeing this again for the first time in about ten years (i was then a child, am now 20), i'm struck by what a powerful exercise in filmmaking it is. So dramatic, so fun, such great songs, but above all, each moment magestically, perfectly directed.If you only saw this when you were a kid, i recommend you reappreciate it with adult eyes."	9
 The best ever film ever made by Disney!!	This film is a true classic and deserves to be top of the top 100 ever films.Apart from its fantastic storyline, the lion king offers a great animated sequence, and the most memorable characters in any disney film. The film is a blend of humour, and morals which invoke children with the best values. The film cleverly uses humour to teach children about the order of life in the wild. The characters Simba, Timon and Pumbaa are so memorable they will stay in viewers minds for eternity!! simply great this film is a must see for all the family!! Hey i am 15 and still intregued by the most fascinating film of all time	
 A Great movie, but 2nd to Beast		9
 What a whopper!	What a whopper!Such a great film. This has to be one of the best films EVER and has some of the best music ever written. It starts with a dramatic musical peace (Circle of Life), it ends with a mirror image of the beginning and has some of the best (and saddest) moments ever created in a film in between. The songs are catchy and so fun, you'll be singing them over and over (well I am!).This is has to be Disney's best without a doubt.If you haven't seen it, you don't know what you're missing out on!Well recommended!	
 Bambi set in Africa		
 Absolutely wonderful		
 Dynamic in every sense	I personally would recommend this animated film to people of all ages because watching it is such an awesome experience.  The animation is nothing short of splendid and the story is an awesome mix of thrills and delight. The action scenes in this film are very well executed and Timon and Pumbaa provide excellent comic relief.  The climactic scene is an especially good adrenaline rush.  Very well deserving of its status as an animated classic.	10
 I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney films ever!	How can anyone not love the lion king? Its cute! Its funny! Its sad! and has great songs by Elton John and Tim Rice. This is one of my childhood films. Its such an uplifting film all about family and friends. I especially love the Timon and Pumbaa, they make me laugh. Definately check this movie out. Its a classic.	
 My favorite movie of all time! *minor spoiler*	"I'm almost 17 years old, and this isn't merely my favorite Disney movie, but my favorite movie period.I saw this movie in 1994 when I was 7 and I loved it then, but only in recent years has the story (especially the ending) truly affected me.The animation is stunning, and I thought the voice actors were all cast perfectly - especially Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, as well as Jeremy Irons as Scar.  I know the quintessential tearjerking part is when Mufasa dies, but the part that always gets to me is at the end when Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and looks up into the clouds and hears his father say ""Remember..."" It gets to me every time!, lolHans Zimmer is a genius and deserved the Best Score Oscar that he won; the music in The Lion King is absolutely beautiful.  As I said, I loved the story SO much, but the music has a lot to do with why this film moves me so much - it's absolutely beautiful.I grew up in the era of Disney movies in the early '90s, and as I recall during that time, it seemed as though that each year their movies got better and better; and I have to say - they've had some really good movies come out since this, but they have ceased to top this one.  10/10!"	10
 Great movie for the entire family!		9
 Boo! Hiss!	"I'm very angry at Disney for adding that dumb song ""Morning Report"" to the movie. It's just plain stupid. It is one of the worst songs ever to make it's way into a Disney musical. Next the Seven Dwarfs from ""Snow White"" is going to do an Eminem Song in a Special Edition of the Classic. Ugh! I just wish Disney would stop fidgeting George Lucas-like with their movies!The Theatrical Release of The Lion King is an all time classic. It's hard to access on the DVD, but it's far better than the Special Edition. The Special Edition is an inferior version that makes me sick..."	
 Why didn't this get an Oscar?	"First off, this should have been nominated (and won) for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. But guess who won instead? Forrest Gump. Granted, Forrest Gump is a good movie. The Lion King was much better. Anyway, back to the review. This movie is the BEST Disney Animated movie ever. Everything, every minute, in this movie is perfect, from the opening ""Circle of Life"" to the end of the movie when Rafiki holds Simba and Nala's cub up. The voice talents are the best I've seen in years, from James Earl Jones (still the one and only Darth Vader) as Mufasa, Matthew Broderick as Adult Simba, and others (like Jeremy Irons, for instance). The art and visuals are beautiful, and the songs rule. In my book, this is a 10/10 and a milestone in Disney's wonderful history."	
 A jewel in Disney's crown		
 Great Movie	I remember when I was little I was taken to see this film. I didnt like it the first time. But recently reviewing it on DVD. I thought it was great.It has a serious story,with great comic relief from Nathan Lane. It is also one of the few disney films,that is not been milked,but now it is,with this DVD release Lion King I1/2 Stupid!3.5/4	
 A movie for the ages and for all ages	I stayed away from this movie for some time until I had to watch it, I loved it and have seen it many times since. The movie has a great theme in the circle of life. My children love it and I can watch it at a deeper level. There is a spiritual message that made me think of what I am leaving behind for my children and their children's children. I would of given it a 10, but there are a couple of spots that drag, but not enough to take more than one point. Not a perfect movie, but a great one	9
 King of Animations	The first time I saw this film was with my mom at the Regal Theater. It was such a larger then life experience that it remains one of my favorite films.Disney put such a fantastic cast of characters together that its hard not to fall in love with the film. (Though Simba is my personal favorite.)This film is a real tresure.	
 Great movie, but purists should avoid the special edition...	"Rather than add to the multitude of great reviews already on this site, I thought I might give my opinion about something a little different... ...I just recently watched the Special Edition version of The Lion King, and nearly had to turn it off while watching their latest ""addition"".Before I go any further, I should say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical numbers in Disney movies. Especially in their more recent films, they've always seemed kind of forced. It's as if they were put in simply because there's a Disney formula the filmmakers are expected to adhere to, not because anybody felt they would better the film. Despite these feelings, I've never had too many problems with the songs in The Lion King. I tolerate them, and even find myself humming them from time to time. But what they've added has got to go, it's entirely unnecessary!!Spoiler Alert!Touted as their ""added scene, with new music!"", this little addition has really made me angry! Entitled ""Morning Report"", this number replaces probably one of my more favorite scenes in the early parts of the film - the pouncing lesson. Rather than hearing Zazu's muffled voice from off screen while Mufasa teaches Simba to hunt, we're treated to a fully fledged musical number. In a monotone singing style that reminds me of something out of My Fair Lady (""Why can't the english...""), Zazu describes completely inconsequential incidents happening on the savana. Simba even manages to get a few verses in before the number ends. Afterwards, the movie hastily picks up where it left off, the rythym and gravity of Mufasas words about the circle of life completely eliminated.The result: those who are familiar with the film will spend the first 30 seconds confused as hell - ""What the?...I totally don't remember this"", followed by another two minutes of disgust - ""Now we know why this didn't make it into the original cut"". What's worse, newcomers to the film will get so caught up in the new song that they'll completely lose sight of the previous scene, arguably one of the more important parts of the film. Mufasa's monologue about the Circle of Life is essentially the thesis for the film, and as such should be emphasised, not undermined.Sorry for the ramble folks. I genuinely love this movie, it's easily amongst my top ten. The art and animation is fantastic, the storyline & characters are great (despite complaints about it being ripped off from Shakespeare or Kimba the White Lion. Though, parallels between TLK and Hamlet elude me) Hans Zimmer's oscar winning score is one of my favorites, and the casting of the voices is perfect (Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones fit their roles like a latex glove). It's for all these things and more that I love this film, so thus it's because of all these things that I hate to see it modified. Call me a purist, but I believe that once somebody is done making a film, especially one as successful and widely appreciated as The Lion King, they should leave well enough alone. Naturally, the choice to disagree with me is entirely yours, this is only my opinion afterall... ...Don't even get me started on what they added to Beauty & The Beast. What's next, Genie singing about what he'd do if Aladdin were to free him? Ugh..."	
 I love this movie!	The Lion King is my favorite disney movie. I've always loved it!I think it's way better than ones like the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. I like everything about The Lion King. And the music is so cool. I don't watch it anymore cause i'm a bit too old but i just felt like saying that this was always my favorite.	10
 Best movie ever	"The story about Simba touches all hearts from small to big. It's one of the best stories ever and also one of the best movies. Also the appearance of Jeremy Irons (Simon in Die Hard 3), James Earl Jones (Darth Vader in Star wars III, IV, V and VI) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) as Scar, Mufasa and Zazu is clearly one of the best casting ever, not to mension Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi. Also there are great songs (like ""I just can't wait to be kings"" (my favourite because of Niketa Calame's beautiful singing voice)) and touching moments (Mufasa's death and his spirit in the skies etc). Two thumbs up!"	10
 succeeds in every place films of this genre fail, truly moving		10
 Wow!	"This is an amazing film! The music, animation, plot, etc. are just breathtaking. So what if Disney borrowed from Shakespeare?  I bet half the films in the Top 250 did too. Don't be fooled by the ""kiddie flick"" label. This film has so much more to offer."	10
 This movie rocks.	I have loved this movie for 8 years and will continue to love it. This has got to be one of the greatest Disney films ever, and one of the greatest of all time. The music is awesome, the animation is breathtaking, and the characters are well made. Anyone who hates this movie has no appreciation for art.	10
 Great Music, Great Movie	First and Foremost, this is a great Disney animated film, as almost all are. The story is endearing and Simba, Nala, Timon, and Pumba all capture your heart. The other outstanding part of this movie is the wonderful music of Elton John, this movie showcases his amazing musical talent in a great way!	9
 To Be Or Not To Be	This movie is almost entirely based on Hamlet, yet fails in the end unlike the Bard's tale of a prince who's father was murdered by his own brother, who in turn takes over the kingdom, driving the prince mad and riddled with grief until the ghost of the father returns and tells his son the truth.	
 Good movie for all ages!	After having recently seeing it on imax, I have to say, the Lion King remains one of my favorite Disney movies. It's just a fun movie, for everyone to enjoy. There's stuff for both adults and children to laugh at, and the more you see it, the more jokes you actually understand. Go see it, and take your whole family!	
 Disney animation at its best.	I haven't been a big fan of Disney animation lately but this is a fine film! It is one of the best examples of the classic hero's journey.  This film has deep characters, a wonderful story, beautiful animation, and a wonderful message.  Oh, and the songs are actually GOOD.  This is one of the only animated musicals that has songs that are catchy, and move the story forward at the same time.  Excellent voice performences by Jeremy Irons, and James Earl Jones.  9 of 10.	9

 I avoided this for 9 years, until tonight...		
 TLK ~ Hamlet	I just wanted to comment, that TLK is indeed an adaptation of Hamlet. But then what's wrong with borrowing from Shakespeare. It's not like it hasn't been done a million times before and even Shakespeare borrowed from others.	
 The King of the jungle and certainly one of Disney's crown jewels		8
 I love this movie	This is the only Disney movie that I ever liked, I don't see how anyone can dislike this movie.  The songs are all great and even though it is only 86 minutes long it seems like 2 hours to me.  I only wish there was more of an epic battle with Scar.  Every other Disney movie has left me disappointed after this one. 10/10	10

 Still remains a favorite.	My previous comments on The Lion King were inadequate.  Therefore, I am writing a newer, better review.The Lion King has always been a favorite of mine.  Sadly, I missed it in theaters, but once it came out on video I watched it like a maniac.  My young eyes could not be torn from the screen and I would watch it nonstop. It was like an obsession.But now I'm a little older and can think about it a little better.  The Lion King has some great things, but some flaws as well.Spoilers.The animation is really good, especially for its time.  It used some CGI (although probably not as much as I'd liked) to add some good effects, but mostly relied on hand-drawn animation.  Everything moves rather smoothly, and one cannot complain about its vivid color.I really like the plot.  The young cub is tricked into believing he killed his own father and is sent into exile.  He must then return to face his uncle Scar, who has taken the throne.  It's a great plot, with several sub-plots that build up rather well, such as Timon and Pumbaa's friendship.The cast is well-chosen.  James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, and even Moira Kelly. What more could one ask for?  Each actor/actress does excellently, taking on their characters with a near perfection that still dazzles me to this day.The music is excellent.  Then again, I love just about anything done by Hans Zimmer.  He is such a great composer.  The Lion King has several great themes that add to the mood of the movie.  I don't care much for the songs, but some of them aren't bad.All in all, The Lion King is another animated flick not just for children. It has the qualities of an adult movie.  Death, pain, suffering, friendship, and conflict.  There is no reason an older person would feel uncomfortable watching it (with the exception of the songs... ugh).I really recommend The Lion King to any avid movie-goer.  It's something you shouldn't miss.	10
 The Greatest Movie Ever Made	This is my favorite movie in the whole world!!! It is seriously the best ever. I love this movie with all my heart. It is awesome.	10
" Lion ""KING"""	Once again, Disney has done it again. The Lion King will go down in history books as one of Disney's great animated films. The voices of such very talented actors, it's brilliant artistry, together with it's humorous and good moral lessons made this film one of the classic masterpiece of the animated world. Truly one of the best. A great film for the whole family. Highly recommended.	
 what a sweet, cute movie!!	this movie was so sweet and cute and at some times even funny, well to me anyway. Most people including me and my family and friends love this movie so much. The 2nd one was kind of stupid, i was expecting a lot more out of it than what i got but the first one is the best disney movie ever!!!	10
 Stupendous	This was one of the phenomanal movies I have ever seen. It is without a doubt one of the best Disney films ever. I could watch it every day and never get tired of it. Out of a 1-10 I would have to rate it a fifteen! This movie is worth buying without a doubt. It had amazing animation, celebrity voices, a great plot and every thing from humor to romance to murder. The bottom line: watch this movie!!!!!!	10
 Best Movie Ever	Simply put, this is the best movie i've ever seen.  I'm a 20 year old male, and I've been watching this movie since it came out on VHS, and can't wait for the DVD...I've seen it probably well over 100 times, and have it memorized word-for-word...LOVE this movie	10
 One of the best Disney films that can be enjoyed by both young and old.	Lion King has got to be one of the better movies that Disney has put out in all time. It has many well known voice talents and is just a great piece of work. No matter what the age most people who see this movie will like it and want to see it again because it is just so well made. 7 *'s out of 10 *'s.	
 Great	I first saw this movie when I was little. I only liked it because it was about one of my favorite animals. Then I watched it again when I was older. I got the jokes, so I liked the movie even more. When I first saw it, I hated Scar. When I watched it when I was older, I thought Scar was a good character. Of course, you're not really supposed to like him. He's the bad guy. I cried when the movie was over. I'm not sure why.10/10	10
 There is a small gap indeed between this movie and greatness		9
 The greatest animated feature.	"The Lion King is the most moving, dramatic and richly animated movie to date. Many have tried and they may continue trying, even Disney themselves, but the will never succeed in making an animated movie quite like The Lion King. The plot is nearly flawless and the humor is witty enough to keep children amused, but the drama could be a bit confusing for the young lads. Never mistake this for a so-called ""kiddie-romp."" This movie is so very much more."	10
 Is this Disney at its best? Absolutely!!		10
 So what if it's a kid movie?	It has a good storyline, a good moral, funny parts, and outstanding/beautiful coloring! Disney deserves a pat on the back for the Lion king, a definate winner. SEE THIS MOVIE, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!	
 LION KING ROCKS	The lion king is the best animated film I have ever seen.  I have a limited edition print of Simba with the petals as his main, and I have a cericell print of the three hyena's. I also have cd's, cups, t-shirt and bath stuff. But what I don't have is a DVD of The Lion King 1.  I have the 2nd one but not the first, and I cannot seem to buy it anywhere.If anybody knows where I can buy it, I would love them forever, cause I just love this film.Walt you outdid yourself on this film.	10
 One of the best of the recent classics	The Lion King is one of the few recent Disney movies that has it all: an enchanting score, great vocal talents, good casting and a charming original story. It will entertain young and old with just the right amount of romance (a very sweet romance too I might add), adventure and suspense. Worthy of it's extended run on the big screen by far, it was also the only disney movie I can think of that got a half decent sequel...(unlike Aladdin whose sequels are not even worth calling cartoons let alone movies), this beautiful story about the balance of life will hold it's charm for years and is destined to be passed down from generation to generation as a true family classic!	
 This is an awesome Disney movie	This is one of Disney's best movies. The animation was really great. The music was really beautifully composed. I love this movie. I've seen this movie hundreds of times. I dont pick at little flaws in moves. I watch movies just to have something to do. This movies had no flaws in it at all. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good animation movie. Children and adults will love this movie.	
 Wonderful		
 simple movie	i think simple is always great and any movie which has optimism with simple roles is always simple.i liked the scene especially when Rafiki hits adult Simba on his head and says its past not to worry.that scene must had a positive impact on any simple person.I will give 10/10.	
 The Greatest Animated Movie of All Time	"Personally, I think ""The Lion King"" is the best animated feature of all time, and even the best movie of all time. The Walt Disney must have worked very hard to make the music. The music is extremely amazing, and the story is extremely well written. It is better than even it's two sequels, and I hope that it can be cherished forever. It's great that there was a special edition, and I hope that people give recognition to this wonderful classic. Great quotes, oh yes. Great characters. Revolting Disney music. Wonderful cast. Unbelievable animation. Undeniably great villainy. Heroic heroes and heroines. Magnificent romance. Superb humor. What a great movie with terrific traits!"	
 Without a doubt the most fabulous animated film to ever be released.	"The spectacular, eye-popping musical introduction to this movie was all I needed to know that I would not be getting up from my seat until the tape stopped rolling. The makers of ""The Lion King"" truly deserve praise. It's hardly believable that Mufasa, Sarabi, Nola, Simba, Timon, Pumba, Rafiki, and Scar don't really exist. And the animation I was dazzled by while watching it still lingers in the back of my mind; everything I saw was beautiful and flawless. I highly doubt Disney will be able to create something as breathtaking, satisfying, emotionally-charged, and overall magnificent ever again."	
 It's all there		
 Great story, cast, music, and so forth.	I have to say that an oldie always has a chance of still being a goodie. I love this movie.  I love it to its very heart.  I still watch it although everyone around me have said that it is stupid because it is Disney.  Well, I say they judge movies by the makers, which is really stupid. I can't tell how great this movie is.  Now that I'm older, it seems that the movie is somewhat short, but the plot is so unique.  The music is great and even fits in (except that the characters frequently erupt into song, but even those songs aren't half bad--heck not bad at all--I have the soundtrack). I suggest you see this movie, even though it's Disney.	10
 How could anyone not like this movie?	How could anyone not like this movie?I first saw this movie in 1994, shortly after its theatrical release.  It has everything going for it!  The animation is first-rate; the actors chosen to perform the voice-overs were top-notch (I could even stomach the fact that it had Jonathan Taylor Thomas in it before he got to be so full of himself.); and the jokes were lively and fast-paced, especially the lines by Timon and Puumba, and Banzai and Shenzi. This is definitely a movie for the young and the young at heart.	
 The greatest animation picture ever made.	The Lion King is a fabulous movie.  I watched it as a boy, when my class went to the theater to watch The Lion King.  I loved it and cried as a young boy.  I actually saw it two times, but the first time was the best time. This film will always live on and I intend to show it to my children.  A great plot and great animation, this film is the greatest animation picture ever made.	10
 The Last Great Disney Movie		10
 The best Disney movie ever made!	This movie is so beautiful. I don't think I can even begin to tell you how much I love this movie! I believe I was about 7 or 8 when this film came out, I remember having the soundtrack and listening to it and singing along with all the songs word for word. But even tho the songs are amazing, the film is WAY better. if you haven't seen it your really missing out. 10/10!	10
 My favorite movie ever. Period.	"First off, I'm going to have to say I completely disagree with everything ""zetes"" said.  The meaning of the film is so much deeper than a child could really comprehend, the music is awesome (I own every Lion King-related CD I could get my paws on:  The Lion King, Rhythm of the Pridelands, The Lion King on Broadway, Return to Pride Rock), and the animation is amazing. I've watched this movie so many times I've got it memorized, yet I still get goose bumps during ""Circle of Life,"" I still get teary eyed when Mufasa dies, and I still want to roar along with Simba when he regains his kingdom. True, The Lion King is very similar to the stories of Kimba the White Lion, but that doesn't mean it's any less of a classic, and it's still my favorite."	
 One of the best	One of the best Disney movies ever made only topped by Beauty and the Beast. I love the music and the CGI animation.  Couldn't have found anyone better than Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones.  Great story about family and living up to your potential.	10
 The Greatest Disney Film	I think this must be the best piece of work that Disney's animation department has come up with.  It is an original story, not their version of someone else's.  I am deeply enthralled with the music.  The Lion King was my introduction into Broadway.  I love the African music and I know a lot of it by heart.  The voice work is fantastic, especially Jeremy Irons and Jim Cummings.  A must see for the whole family.	10
 One of my favorite animated movies		10
 comments from a mildly obsessed fan	"The Lion King is my favorite movie of all time.  The combination of voice actors was perfect(especially James Earl Jones for Mufasa, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella for Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons for Scar), the scenes were animated awesomely(especially the stampede scene in the gorge and during ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", the music set just the right mood for each scene as well as having a truly African sound with all the chants, there was just the right blend of humor and seriousness, and the messages it conveys are strong yet subtle enough that they don't take away from the movie. Even the sequel is great, as much as a sequel can be.  I give it a ten!  If you haven't seen it, it is a must-see, and if you have seen it, see it again!  This is truly a film worth your time!"	10
 *SPOILERS*	Disney movies are known to be brilliant, and although I haven't seen a lot of them, I know enough to know, that 'The Lion King' is a true Disney masterpiece!The movie is all about the animals that live in the African plains and the Circle of Life. We meet adventurous cub Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) who 'just can't wait to be king'.Unfortuantely, this isn't going to be easy as Simba's Uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) has his heart set on becoming the new king, and little does Simba know, it was Scar that really killed his dad, Mufasa (James Earl Jones).The rest of the cast featured are Rowan Atkinson ('Mr. Bean') as Zazu and Whoopi Goldberg ('Sister Act') as one of Scar's hench-hyenas.A beautiful movie with amazing graphics, a wonderful soundtrack (thanks to Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber) and an excellent storyline. 8/10 (Followed by The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, and the spin off series 'Timon & Pumbaa'.)	
 Very Good Disney Movie	I was 8 when I first saw this movie and enjoyed the movie and now, 7 years later I still think its great. The movie is full of wit and charm and with real emotion. This is probably the most mature disney movie so far. When i was 8 i cried once or twice in the movie and it still makes some people cry now. If you havent seen this movie yet, where have you been? Go out and buy it right now. This is the best disney movie also. I loved the way the storyline unfolded and the voice acting. Especially matthew broderick as adult simba.Overall this movie was probably the best movie of 1994, it still is the classic it was 7 years ago.	10
 the best!	"this has to be my favorite disney animated classic. i love every secondof this movie, and it can always cheer me up. the animation in thismovie is so great. and the soundtrack stands out as one of the best. ilove the bits with the hyenas! Ed is the funniest one in the movie!(SPOILER!) i think that my favorite part has to be when Mufasa and Zazuare talking about Scar and Zazu says, ""He'd make a lovely throw rug, andthen you could take him out and beat him!"" or when Rafiki is doing hiskarate! those parts always crack me up!"	
 An Opening Scene Frisson		9
 terrific	I loved this movie.An excellent voice cast lends to a marvelous story. I enjoyed watching it and thought it was well done. If you haven't seen it, see it!Simba is tricked into thinking he is responsible for his father's death and sent into exile. After reaching maturity, he returns to avenge the wrongs.*** out of ****	
 Disney's best movie	This movie has it all. Strong characters, great animation, and a good script. Disney will be hard pressed to make a better movie than this one. Ever. You always laugh at the comedy, (Spoiler)we feel like crying when Mufasa dies, and we feel joy when Simba wins. And Scar has to be the best villain ever on Disney, except for maybe Malificent from Sleeping Beauty.	10
 Disney's Best		
 Easily comparable to Billy Corgan in greatness		
 Great Disney, but hardly their best		8
 Some housewives have nothing better to do..		
 My Favorate Disney Movie	"This Movie was My favorate because it was quite a contrast to other Disney Movies. the biggest contrast is that there is no Wussy Princess or ""fair young maiden"" to rescue, and I like the lack of that plot here. the songs are unforgettable, being written By Elton John, the vivid animation, the moving storyline....after I saw this movie, for the next nine months, time just crawled by for that video to come out."	
 The melter of a stony heart	"It was not until watching this film that I grew a soft spot for Disney movies. The typical combination of music, comedy, drama and romance is perfect? Hang on... Did I just say drama? Yes, The Lion King has moments of pure drama unrivalled by many feature films, let alone Disney films. WARNING!SPOILER!.......... When Mufasa dies, and you see Simba's tears, the mournful music...IT'S TOO MUCH! ;( I also love this film for it's use of top British talent, ieRowan Atkinson as Zazu and Jeremy Irons as Scar (Is there anybody who can do better bumpkins and villains?) Indeed, there is a fine ensemble cast, and Matthew Broderick has never been better (with the exception of his turn in The Cable Guy.) People here have mentioned the comparison to Shakespeare, particuarly to Hamlet. But Robert Guillaume's turn as Rafiki bears more relation to King Lear's Fool. Indeed, through manipulating Shakespeare and using an original story, Disney found the ability to reach it's pinnacle. Oh, yeah, and Timon and Pumbaa made my laugh my ass off (The word ""Mook"" is now part of my vocabulary.) Brilliant 10/10"	10
 Everything the light touches...	I still love this movie! :-)This movie is an absolutely beautiful piece of animated work, and is entertainment for both the young and adult audiences. The story is beautiful and tear-jerking, and is by far one of Disney's most beautiful movies.If you have no seen The Lion King, what are you waiting for?**** (out of 5 *'s).	
 Another Disney masterpiece	The quality of Disney's films has always been high and this film is no exception. The breathtaking scenery of Africa is done to a T. Scar makes a worthy villain with the hyenas as his henchmen, and Timon and Pumbaa, as well as young Simba himself, provide humour. The songs fit in very well and are crucial to the storyline. My only possible complaint is that the second half of the story isn't quite as enjoyable or interesting as the first, possibly because matters have become serious. This is a movie one can enjoy over and over again, and one for the whole family. 9/10	9
 A life changing film	I think everyone should see Lion King at least once. It's beautiful animation and memorable songs make it one of Disney's best (and trust me I have seen most of them). Circle of Life has to be one of my favorite Disney songs. I'd encourage people to rent it before you get it because this film (like all films) may not be for everyone. I liked it, but it is a family movie, and should be judged as one.	10
 The Best of the Best	"This is simply the finest animated film that Disney has ever produced.Yes, I very much enjoyed Toy Story and Toy Story II, but the Lion King has a depth unmatched by any other Disney animated film.Indeed, this is a film that not only matches the best of the Japanese animation genre but exceeds them.Make sure you have this one in your Library of ""all-time"" greats."	10
 Beautiful	On anything but a childish level, this movie surrounds you in some of the most well done scenery I have ever seen in an animated movie. The music is the gorgeous counterpart to the environment, with some of the best compositions I've heard in a disney picture.The story is plain but powerful, the humor is pretty much all for the kids. But nevertheless, a beautiful movie.	10
 I show it again today and I was still amazed.	"I show ""The Lion King"" in the movies when it first came out and I loved it then.  I got the video in 1996 and watched it almost every single day.  So when I was looking for something to watch on TV and there was nothing on and I picked up ""The Lion King"" I wasn't surprised when I was so amazed by the music, the characters, the animation and the plot.  My favorite character of all time will surely be ""Scar"".  I would put ""The Lion King"" up there as one of the best Disney movies.  I own many Disney movies and this ranks right up there with the best of them.  ""The Lion King"" deserves all the praise it can get. I really don't see how anyone could not like this movie.  This is one of the few animated movies the parents and kids can enjoy together."	
 Funny!	This is a really funny movie, with some great characters with great voices (especially Scar, Zazu and the hyenas). The scene where Scar kills Mufasa is eerie, and the music in that scene is creepy and bone chilling. Yes, the story does have its weak links, most of the songs are fun but forgettable (although the African instrumental songs in the background really add to the atmosphere), and could have been a bit shorter.The character of the long-suffering Zazu is hysterical. However, someone else does the voice of Zazu in the sequel and that ruined the character for me. Great job, Rowan Atkinson!	
 Watch this movie it is great!	I have seen this movie quite a few times and I still love it. It is a movie for all ages and it has a great story line.Amazing voices and special effects and music and I would definitly reccomend this movie to everyone I give it 10/10. Well Done!	
 The Lion King as political allegory	"When this first came out, I was so impressed I saw it several times.  It still remains one of my favorite movies and nearly everyone I've ever met who has seen it regards it highly.  That said, it is somewhat surprising to me that more people do not recognize that The Lion King owes about as much to Hamlet as it does Orwell's Animal Farm.  Here's why. (SPOILERS)The herd of wildebeasts utilized by Scar appear to represent mindless masses of general populace.  By themselves they are essentially harmless, but properly (or improperly) rallied, they can even succeed in overthrowing an entire government.  The hyenas who are conned into scaring them seem to stand for basic undesirable elements plaguing society today (the alluring culture of the street, corrupt law enforcement officials, possibly irresponsible journalistic practices).  The movie also makes a strong point that when these individuals are allowed to roam freely in society, inevitably the same vices plaguing their territory (elephant graveyard - perhaps alluding to the inner cities of many major cities... at least in the U.S.) will befall everyone else as well.  Note the strong resemblance of the rock formation at the end of ""Be Prepared"" to skyscrapers found downtown in any large city.  For these and other reasons, it's not too much of a surprise that The Lion King was criticized for racist overtones.  Still, if you can put this aside, and haven't seen it by now, The Lion King remains the most stunning and complex films in animation history"	10
 Disney's best ever.		10
 Best Disney animation film	Heads and shoulders(tails and manes) the best Disney animation production-The Lion King serves as an exempalry work for both kids and adult alike. Brings about the feeling of wonderment and joy of a true adventure and yet has all the morality of serious adult drama without the preachy sermonization often afflicting that genre. A classic in form and function with something for everyone	10
 Simply the best animated feature I have ever seen!!!	I must say that after seeing this movie I have a new respect for Disney and its animators.  The film is simply beautiful in every respect.  The voice acting is first rate (Disney did a wonderful job casting), highlighted by a brilliant performance by Nathan Lane as the feisty timone.  The sound-track is also wonderful.  Elton John and Tim Rice have done a great job of composing the sound-track, which flows flawlessly with the movie.  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the show-stopping animation and dazzling scenics which would impress even the most cynical viewer.  All in All, This film provides the viewer with a sense of enjoyment and fulfillment that is rare in film today.  If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for go out and rent it today!	10
 One of the greatest animated movies of all time	"When I first saw this film in the theatre, I expected another kids movie. Boy was I wrong.  The story is relatively old,(ironically, this is Disney's first original animated film)  The opening sequence is no less than stunning.  The song (Circle of Life) starts playing in the background.  The grass moves, and all these animals are going to see Mufasa's son (the next Lion King).  It is beautiful in all it's glory  The songs range from incredible ('Circle of Life', 'Can You Feel the Love tonight') to the horrible (""I just can't wait to be king"").  The score is thrilling, and the animation is truly remarkable.  I feel that this is the second best animated film of all time (after Fantasia).  Beauty and the Beast runs a close third."	
 One of the best movies I've seen!	This movie not only has entertainment value, but also has embedded in it great lessons to be learned in life.  It teaches that taking responsibility in life is important, and that everything you do or don't do affects others. It's a great movie for children and adults alike!	10
 a rip off of the LAND BEFORE TIME	warning (a few of my comments may contain spoilers, not that it will make any difference to your viewing pleasure) Now even though I think this movie is entertaining, it is not however better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST (Disneys best by far)and it has a very unoriginal story line and is a rip off of the LAND BEFORE TIME (see my comment on it). And here is why....1) simba's father died just like littlefoot's mother died2) the circle of life thing....Don Bluth thought of that first and it became a central part of THE LAND BEFORE TIME. Disney did not 'invent' it.3) the orphaned child gets revenge by killing their tormentor. Scar vs the T Rex. Coincidence???also has any one ever seen KIMB THE WHITE LION (created by the makers of ASTERO BOY) the lion kink is also copied from this lovey japanese cartoon series.Well I just couldn't help pointing it out.The songs are great and the animation is lovely. But I think the movie could be improved bya) eliminating timone and pumba (or just getting rid of timone)b)  use african voices for the movie. I mean this IS Africa for god's sake. Why oh why do we have to listen to horrible american accents when we could be happy with the wonderful african ones. Despite what Disney may lead our poor children to think, our world is full of wonderful diverse accents and unfortunately only the american ones are used.All in all I give this movie a 9/10 as it is entertaining despite its unoriginal story line.Scar was my favourite and it is a pity he did not get a bigger part.ps  look at his paws and you will see that sometimes the pads on his front paws join in some scenes and in others he has separate pads for each toe. There's one mistake that disney forgot to fix.	9
 Best Disney Film Ever. Also the darkest		
 An animation masterpiece.	"This film is one of the best Disney films to date. Together with ""Bambi"",""The Little Mermaid"",""Beauty and the Beast"",that suggest that animated movies aren't ""Just for kids""they are an art form.Once seeing this film one sees the power that this genre can exude.I have to comment on the voice acting in this film that is brilliant,especially Jeremy Irons as ""Scar"",the best animated villain ever."	
 Praise	I have never witnessed such a spellbinding spectacle of enchantment as this. The Lion King is truly one of Disney's most amazing stories, and the fact that it is original make it even more so. It brings out the better part of your emotions, making you cry, laugh, gasp or think. With a terrific cast and an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, this film will remain one of my personal favourites for as long as I live. Disney, my hat's off to you.	
 My First Disney as an adult	"This was the first Disney movie I bought for my then 3 year old daughter.  I absolutely loved it!  Like all young children, she watched it over and over (maybe 20 times) and could say much of the dialog along with the characters. I watched it with her most of the time.  I remember an acquaintance of mine asked me if I rented any good movies lately.  I said the best movie I had seen in a long time was ""The Lion King"".  She looked at me like I was quite odd and said ""That's a kid's animated movie.""  I proceeded to inform her that there was much adult humor in the movie and how the animation was riveting.  I can't wait until my now infant son is old enough to watch it.  We now own about 25 Disney tapes, but ""The Lion King"" is still my all-time favorite. If Disney ever comes out with anything to surpass it, that will really be something."	
 Sheesh, Who Cares?	It seems I'm the only one who doesn't believe this movie is the greatest Disney film of all time. I personally dislike this movie because there's not enough action AND because there's too much of those idiots: Timon and Pummba. I'm embarrassed to watch this movie in front of anyone!	
 Disney's most fantastic movie ever!!	I love this movie! The story is great, the characters are great, the soundtrack is great, the animation is great, what more can I say? The best Disney movie!!!	
 Animated adventure that is a treat for the eyes and the heart!	"I will admit it, I do not immediately run out when Disney or any other company puts out its latest animated feature. It's just not the fare I indulge in often. If I had it to do over again, I would gladly race to the theater to see ""The Lion King,"" a wonderful and moving family film from Disney. Never have I seen an animated film so vibrant and visually stunning. On top of that, the story is not what I'd consider a kiddie fest. The tale of Simba as he discovers his place in the ""circle of life"" is heartwarming and almost realistic. Could celebrity voices ever be more suitably matched with animated characters? James Earl Jones is fabulous as Mufasa, the king of the jungle, and Jeremy Irons is devilishly villainous as Scar, the jealous brother who longs to take Mufasa's place as king. Whoopi Goldberg is also a surprise in what I believe is the first time she has played a bad guy.  This is definitely one of the best films of 1994, and possibly one of the top three best animated adventures from the Disney studios. Cartoons can truly have a life of their own. Rating: Four stars."	
 A moving, beautiful, work of art......	This movie was the reigning film in my heart ever since it's release. It has beautiful artwork, and very spiritual, happy music. I have watched this film so many times my VHS wore out and I had to buy it in laserdisc. The quirky antics of a young warthog(who bears a rather strong scent) and a tactless, but loving and very lovable meerkat team up as a duo to help Simba out of a tragic period in his life. Zazu was my very favorite character, he had charms AND attitude. This movie is simply the brightest crayon in the box, it outshines all the other colors with it's sheer brilliance.If you can find this, consider yourself lucky, you and whoever you decide to share it with.	
 The Lion King IS NOT A Classic!	The Lion King was EXTREMELY overly praised... mainly by the public... It is nowhere near the best disney movie... and i'm sorry to say... it's not really in there best effort at all... if you want their true classic try Beauty And The Beast... it showcases disneys brillance with much wounderful gusto! The Lion King Is NOT a classic...and shouldn't be thought of as one... its story is just so-so and the characters are not all that memorable... Disney definitely failed to bring any charm into this movie... mistaken hugely by the public as a classic.. in which no matter how hard anyone tries... this will never be...	
 Disney delight	Now that's what I call entertainment. Disney has outdone themselves once more. Following great films like The Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin, they pull a stunt like this. A very likable story and some great comical reliefs, like Timon, Pumba and Zazu. It's a fable of the old sort, where diferent generations can see it on diferent levels. I've seen both the original American version and in the Danish dubbed version and they both entertained me. I can really recommend it to all ages.	9
" Fantastic Animation (with a capital ""A"").... Superb voices!"	For sure I am a Disney-fan. But perhaps I don't like the enormous media hype which is there whenever a new Disneyanimation hits the cinemas.The power of this movie is that it's both for kids and adults. And because I am a bit of both! I had the time of my life! DO BELIEVE THE HYPE!	7
 Initiation packed in an animated movie		8
 A powerful movie	This movie has got everything. Nice story and characters, great music, great animation and voice cast,...just about everything you could think of. It does contain some very powerful scenes; I remember my sister crying when Mufasa died, and she cried till the end of the movie. But it is very entertaining and funny.8/10	8
 Self-satisfied nonsense	All credit where it's due, on a technical level, THE LION KING is a very well put-together movie. The colors are vivid, the character's movements are fluid, and it's just a very pretty movie to look at. I give this movie a bad rap all the time, but even I have to admit this. My problem is that it's been unbelievably overblown for twenty years. Disney marketing got it into their heads that this is some sort of high prestige experience; bigger than all their other animated fluff, and warranting of blind praise from everyone. It's impenetrable for me because I haven't been able to listen to the soundtrack for two decades (and the movie's big on its music). 1994 radio was saturated with both the Elton John songs and the Simba numbers, and I haven't been able to hear any of it again since. For a musical, that's kind of a deal- breaker.Story-wise, it definitely works better when you're a kid. The characters aren't obnoxious and Simba's reckoning isn't shallow. But it's just such nauseating material. The whole thing's built on pomp and spectacle, but there's nothing underneath. 3/10	3
 Whole family will thoroughly enjoy this one	"I have a confession to make. This is the first fully animated Disney production that I have ever seen! Perhaps some would say that I have begun at the wrong end (beside the fact that I have been living in a closet all my life), however ""The Lion King"" (Disney's 32nd full length animated feature) has given me an inkling of what I may have been missing.Disney continue their recent trend of popular animated features by bringing us this tale about the circle of life. Young lion cub ""Simba"", heir to his father ""King Mufasa's"" throne, thinks there'll be nothing to assuming his rightful place at the top of the food chain. Things look terribly gloomy though when Simba's evil Uncle Scar kills Mufasa, takes his brother's place as king and drives poor Simba far from his home. The dramatic adventure story that unfolds from here is good, and will keep the kids involved, yet the movie's real strength is its sharp wit and very funny dialogue. Several moments will have you in stitches, while movie buffs will delight in ""performances"" from many recognisable voices. James Earl Jones is an appropriate choice for Mufasa, Jeremy Irons' Scar is wonderfully sardonic, while comedienne Whoopi Goldberg is a real treat as a nasty Hyena. Listen too for the voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, Cheech Marin, Robert Guillaume, Ernie Sabella, Nathan Lane and Moira Kelly.""The Lion King"" is a joy musically too, with Hans Zimmer providing a vibrant African score and both Elton John and Tim Rice some catchy show numbers, including Elton's beautiful love theme ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" Disney's high production values are clearly evident in a fine animated film which the whole family is sure to thoroughly enjoy.Saturday, October 29, 1994 - Knox District Centre"	6
 credibilityis the most important thing	"I used to like the lion king since i was a kid, but after knowing that the movie that promoted as ""Disney's first original movie not based on anything"" is actually stolen from anime called ""Kimba the White Lion"" created by Osamu Tezuka. I stopped liking the lion king, and lose all my trust in Disney."	1
 Overrated TRASH!!!		2
 this movie is horrible...i don't know what disney was thinking when they made it.	It sucks!!! it seriously does...ive seen crap that was better then that movie.. and its the highest grossing animated movie of all time?!?!? what on earth were people thinking when they went to see that...it was just terrible..a waste of money and time on disney's part.	1
 Snores!!!!	There are a million other Disney movies that are sooo much better than this one! This movie is just boring all throughout. Also,i felt it was too scary for children. It made my little cousins cry. The songs were bad in my opinion. I hated every character, and i really didn't care what happened to them, really i just wanted this movie to end! Disney is capable of so much more, which I saw in 2015 Cinderella! That Beats out this any day of the week. There just wasn't anything for me in this movie, very bland and boring. I really don't know what else to say about it, it was bland and poor! I'm giving The Lion King a 3/10 for being a poor attempt at a family film by Disney.	3
 Overrated rip-off	"Taking Kimba and claiming this mess ""original"" is just unforgivable."	1
 good, not great	Am I the only person who seems to notice this movie is Hamlet, watered down and without the incest?  Granted, Disney movies aren't known for having the most original plots, but I expected a little more.  Typically, I like Disney's animated features, but I found this one to be a little blah, to be frank.  Perhaps I am being overly harsh and expecting too much from a kid's flick, or maybe I was wanting something a little more moving and less corny.	5
 Rip Off Cheap Dumb Movie!	The top 250 films of all time this apparently is? Well obviously a bunch of chimpanzee's must be deciding what films are featured on this list. The Lion King is a terrible film that is massively overrated. After watching it I felt I had seen the film before. The ideas were stolen from the films Tarzan and Ice Age! I couldn't believe the people who made this film had ripped off two other films and got away with it, an absolute disgrace!There are some poor elements of the film: 1. Hyenas. Hyenas got a lot of bad press because of this film, thousands must have died since it's release. Anyone involved or who even bought or watched this film has the blood of innocent hyenas on their hands. 2. Animation. Very poor quality. We live in 2016, can we not get better technology now to produce better animations? 3. Jeremy Irons. Whilst not a bad actor, he is a complete hypocrite. There is a video where he actively speaks out against the death penalty. That's pretty funny Irons considering you acted the role of Scar and had no problem killing off your own brother Mufasa. Hypocrite much?Poor film that is not worth viewing. Don't waste your time.	1
 A GOOD DISNEY FILM	This film can entertain everyone young or old, this movie film is very interesting and a real deal film.thia is one of animated movie.The animated is top notch and flawless.This is a standout film	10
 the lion king	Best disney movie ever one of my favorites love this movie	10
 Disney does it again	The new Lion King was wonderful. We all know the story line, but the new voice and technology was so amazing life like. Take the film if you have not seen this movie is for everyone of all ages.	10
 😍👌😢THE BEST MOVIE EVER😍👌😢	'The Lion King' (1994) is the best film I ever watched in my entire lifetime. This movie is really made for both adults and kids. Both adults and kids would find enjoy in this film. This movie is really emotional and feeling. Other feature of this movie is its musical touch, which is beautiful and could entertain every ages of people. Simba is the character which entertained me a lot. The movie could able to create a emotional and romantic atmosphere with its musics and animation. Everything in this movie is perfect. Not even a second in this movie is boring. I recommend this movie to everyone who do not watch this movie.	10
 THE BEST!!!!	I love this movie so much! My favorite character is Simba because he's awesome! I also like Zazu because he's weird and funny. I also like Mufasa because he's wise and amazing. Timon and Pumbaa were funny as well. They helped Simba with so much! I hope everyone watches it!	10
 Very good	We enjoyed this film immensely. Great voices for the characters, including a compelling villain. Loosely follows the story of Shakespeare's Hamlet.	7
 A gorgeous looking animation, with good voice acting.	This is definitely one of disney's BEST looking animation. The character animation of this is so fluid and the colours just leap. But my lord, the backgrounds are masterpieces. This film is pretty much a paintng come to life. I do like the story, but Timon and Pumba are the stars of the film. They are just so funny. The film is as amazing now being an adult, but it still is amazing.	8
 Generational movie	I call this a generational movie! This is the movie that you watch as a child then pass it down to your child, then your child passes it down to their child. Good classic, generational movie!	8
 This is a nice movie.	My worst favourite part is when Simba's dad dies and when Simba fights with Scar.	5
 The Lion King is very good	I just love this movie since I was kid in early 2000's.So I have love about Bloopers, YTPs and more about it.That's all I can say.	7
 an experience	"it has many gifts. but one remains fundamental - it is a wise and convincing rehabilitation of the basic role of animation : to be tool of education. to give values and examples of honest life. not in didactic manner but as the old stories from the Middle Orient, like the epics or the fairy tale of grandparents. because the technology, the love stories, the invincible heroes, the beautiful young girls are only a side of animation purpose. the essence is the profound change of the viewer to be better man. and ""Lion king""did it. in admirable manner. using the story of Hamlet and the technique of fable, it becomes a personal experience. sure, for entire family. and this is the best fact about it - to open a large window. to yourself."	
 Great movie	One of the best animated films of all times... I have watched it 100 times. I wasn't a fan of the movies that followed this one but this one is for sure one of the best.I watched as a small child and really think it even gets better as I get older.The first time I watched it I was draw in from the start and I don't think I took my eyes off it.	9
 Another Disney Classic Inspired by Hamlet 10 out of 10	Disney's Lion King brings Shakespeare's Hamlet to life through Jungle creatures with some beautiful songs, I just can't wait to be king, my personal favourite. Well done Elton John for music. The film has some amazing animation and the cast every single one of them deliver's performances to remember. The story might be hard for young children but that fact is as the song says The Circle of Life its not easy no matter if your Human or Animal.I was a teenager when it was released but I remember riding in friend's cars when it was the fashion to have big base speakers in the boot and Just can't wait to be king's base was almost made for this scenario!All time great watch it at least once a month and never ever get bored.	10
 Music and Storyline	I love everything about the Lion King, the story the sound track, I guess it is to me what Frozen is to a lot of kids last year. I found myself singing along to every song. I think my favourite song was I just can't wait to be king, but I much prefer the character versions of the song's over the Elton John versions. That said Elton John's version of Can you feel the love tonight is just so romantic. The story could be adapted for any situation and I hope it brings kids a little closer to wildlife and an understanding of their natural habitat.Simba was such a fun cat he deserves to be king!	10
 King Disney!	The Lion King (1994): Dir: Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff / Voices: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella: Here is one of the most ambitious of Disney animations. Set in South Africa and regarding the respect and measuring authority. It opens with a celebration as lion cub Simba is born and he desires to be just like his brave father Mufasa but his deceitful and jealous uncle Scar seeks to prevent Simba as one day becoming King. Central plot regards an incident staged by Scar that results in Mufasa's death and Simba's leaving the pride in belief that it was his fault. Glorious African animated scenery with a variety assortment of wildlife appearances. Matthew Broderick voices adult Simba who will grow to different standards after being rescued by a warthog named Pumbaa and a meerkat named Timon. He will have to adapt to his destiny and challenge Scar for his rightful place as King. Scar is voiced by Jeremy Irons who forms an alliance with hyenas and successfully reduces the pride land to ruins until Simba dethrones him. Moira Kelly voices Simba's childhood friend lioness Nala whose adult form is a great introductory and her fate bares brilliant repeat to the opening. Pumbaa and Timon become the ultimate rags to riches duo. They are voiced effectively by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. This is Disney animation at its very best. Score: 10 / 10	10
 Best classic childhood movie	this movie is literally the best cartoon that's ever been made. I'm sure most of you know that scar killed muhfasa and wanted to dominate the kingdom, and then simba grew up and fought scar and killed him and became ruler. But this movie was so sad and admirable. I suggest this childhood movie to any child, even teenagers or adults. I believe that people need to enjoy and know what a good movie is all about. Also the fact that the movie wasn't only a single but instead a series kept the audience attention to keep wanting more. The book is so sad that it can bring tears to anybody's eyes. What I also like its the musical aspect, it really makes the movie look more lively and unique than any other cartoon being made now. The graphics of the movie wasn't horrific rather it was terrific. To me, it's the best movie made.	10
 Be Prepared for the Lion King		10
 King of Disney's Jungle, The Lion King is a Classic Tale Spun to Perfection	Pretty much the king of the '90s Disney resurgence, and a great example of the studio's strengths. It's a very familiar story - basically Hamlet with singing animals - but they really make it their own through charm, whimsey and simple, effective characterization. The animation is excellent, too, silky smooth and grounded in reality but also expressive, colorful and often downright stunning. Musicals aren't usually my thing, though, and once or twice it felt like the tunes were being crammed into a scene when they really weren't necessary. Still, it's a vibrant, attention-demanding classic that held my kids' hearts from start to finish and authentically embraces an under-appreciated culture. Deservedly one of animation's upper tier titles, it was really cool to share it with a new generation.	9
 Gets better with age !	The highest grossing 2D animated film of all time, one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever, a smash hit. And it deserves every bit of praise. The Lion King not only stands the test of time but it actually gets better as time goes on. One of the film's (many) strong points is its characters. Simba is very likable, as a cub he's wide eyed, curious, can be cocky but it all comes from a good place. As an adult he is fun loving but conflicted by the pain of his past. Scar is one of the greatest film villains of all time. He's cunning & manipulative but is also cowardly and somewhat petulant (as shown when he takes over). He is also one of the few Disney villains to kill off one of the main characters. The side characters are also great, I know everyone talks about Timon & Pumba but I think the hyenas are the funniest part of the film. James Earl Jones is great as Mufasa, who in my opinion is one of the greatest movie dads of all time. The songs, who hasn't heard them? They're all great, catchy & memorable. If I had to not pick it would be elements such as, why does the rain come back when Simba wins, but that's just Disney logic. The Lion King is the greatest animated film of all time and only gets better with age.	10
 One of the Great Disney Films of the Early 1990s	"Tricked into thinking that he caused the death of his own father (James Earl Jones), a young lion cub (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) flees and abandons his destiny as the future king.Disney's strongest period in recent history was the late 1980s and early 1990s. They consistently released hits: ""Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"", ""Beauty and the Beast"". The princesses from these films have taken their place alongside the classics (Snow White and Cinderella). Until ""Frozen"" twenty years later, this success would not be repeated.""The Lion King"" came at the end of this cycle, and did not feature a princess (at least not in human form). But it is still a great tale of loss, redemption, triumph. Many would place it among the top three Disney cartoons ever made."	7
 One of the best animated movies of all time	This movie is amazing! This was one of the biggest movies yet! I love the part when Scar has a fight with his brother. And I love the song I just can't wait to be king and can you feel the love tonight! and Nala meet up for the fist time in years and then they fall in love. This is the best movie ever made before lion king II and Frozen! And it was the best movie since Aladdin at that time. This movie is suitable for the ages 6-11 as there is some violence, and it is more suitable for younger kids. I love this movie and it will never be forgotten in my lifetime. I rate this move a 10/10 for loads of thinks like: the animation, the entertainment , characters, adventure (adventure movies are my type of thing) and of course the presentation the owners made while making this awesome movie! When I watch this over and over again I just think about how could animation studios make movies like this again? I know Frozen was one of the best movies in the century, But I love this movie andI will love it forever .	10
 A great movie	At first I thought it will be a boring film, because I thought it was for kids, but it wasn't. As Simba begins to take the way of the Lion King I really began to feel happy. And I loved the fact that Simon and Pumba appeared. I can't explain more, better watch it. It is a masterpiece. The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! Outstanding animated feature from Disney that sports outstanding songs by Elton John, a compelling story and first-class animation. Young lion cub Simba is to be king, but he leaves after he believes he was the reason for his father's death (of course this is not so).	10
 Waited 18 years to see it... Worth the wait?...		8
 Excellent use of 3D effects	Being of a certain age, and without children, this is one of the classic Disney films I have never seen, but the opportunity arose to finally getting around to watching it when my mother, who is into her 80's and disabled, said she would love to see it. With the help of a very good friend, a veteran of the industry, we went to one of Bristol's (England) out-of-town multi-plexes and, for the grand total of £0.00 (or, if you like, $0.00!!!), sat back and waited for the fun to begin! The film is big, brash, colourful, and total predicable of course. Rightful pretender to the throne is framed by nasty old Scar, leaves, meets good friends, is persuaded to return, fights nasty old Scar, and Simba takes up his rightful place as King of the Pride. All very Disney, very good triumphing over evil, good guys getting their rightful dues, baddies getting their due comeuppance etc. What raises this above the level of most other animated films of this kind is the quality of the animation - quite superb - some great characters (the farting Warthog is fantastic, Scar suitably nasty, Simba proud and upright, etc), and some excellent songs - Circle of Life has, of course, become a children's classic song! The version I took my mother to see was the newly released 3D one, and I have to say that I was very impressed with how Disney had turned a 2D film into a film with great depth and scope. It did not always work as well as it could have, some scenes still looked a little flat, but certainly when the birds were flying overhead, or the camera was swooping down onto different characters, then the effects were excellent, and really added to the enjoyment of the film.If you have yet to catch up with this film then I would highly recommend you go and watch the 3D version - it is very well done, and worth the admission price - unless you are like myself and know the right people to gain free admission!!!	8
 The Lion King- A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!		
 Disneys best movie! Nothing has topped this film!!!!		10
 One of the greatest animated movies ever!	"Some movies just aren't as good as you remembered them when you were a kid. Others actually get better with age. The Lion King falls in the latter category.Based on the play Hamlet, The Lion King is the classic story of a young cub Simba, who is the son of the proud Mufasa. Simba eagerly wants to follow his father's footsteps and become a great king of the pride-lands like him - until tragedy strikes, which Simba blames himself for, and runs away from the pride-lands, where he befriends Timon and Pumba and follows their carefree ""Hakuna Matata"" way of life. However, he's about to learn that while you can't change the past, you can't run away run away from it either.If there is any animated film that could be considered epic, The Lion King would be a top contender. From start to finish, The Lion King is practically one great scene after another. The epic beginning, the trip to the elephant graveyard, Simba and his dad bonding, Scar's plan, the stampede, the tragedy, Nala finding Simba the romance between them, Simba confronting his father, his return to pride rock, his battle to reclaim the throne, and the ending; All of these could have been highlights of a lesser movie. Here, if I had to pick my favorite scene, I would just pick the whole movie.Not only that, but almost every aspect of the film is great. The story, as I said before, is classical with a great theme to it (face your responsibilities, don't run away from them) while the characters are just as good. I'm sure many kids can relate to the cub Simba, from him wanting to be just like his dad to him being so hyper active, waking up his parents before the sun even rises (something I used to recall doing when I was little) Even as an adult, Simba remains appealing (I'm sure deep down, a lot of us would just love to live a care and responsibility free life) Also, like the best of Disney's movies, we have a rich variety of supporting characters, from the prim and proper Zazu to the wise and kind of weird Rafiki the hilarious Timon and Pumba (normally, adding a warthog with a bad smell for humor would hurt such a dramatic story, and yet the filmmakers manage to get enough laughs out of Pumba without being too crude or hurting the story)The characters are helped by a great cast. Rather than simply going after big names, the filmmakers brought a talented cast that fit the characters perfectly.Matthew Broderick is extremely likable as Simba, while James Earl Jones gives off all the power, authority, fierceness, and occasional warmth as Mufasa, who is arguably one of the greatest dads in cinema. Too often, when making a tough fatherly figure, the filmmakers will give him a total lack of care or emotion, yet here, despite all his fierceness, Mufasa can still manage to feel like a big teddy bear when he plays with Simba. Jeremey Irons, meanwhile, is one seriously underrated actor, and here he shines as the cunning and conniving Scar. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Martin, Jim Cummings, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume round off the rest of the incredible cast.The film is also incredibly heartfelt, with some truly touching scenes. Chief among them (those who don't want spoilers should skip to the next paragraph) is the tragic scene of the death of Mufasa. I've seen reviews that have compared that scene negatively to the death of the mother in Bambi, calling it secondhand compared to that scene. Personally, as a kid the death of Mufasa was much more upsetting to me than the death scene in Bambi. Nowawdays, I think both are powerful, but in two different ways. With Bambi, the tears comes from Bambi running through the forest calling for his mother, not even knowing she's dead. With The Lion King, the tears come from Simba seeing his dad lying there lifeless, and refusing to accept it. Him running around asking for someone to come help still brings tears to my eyes to this day.The score, meanwhile, is done by Hans Zimmer, who is one of my favorite composers, and the score for The Lion King is one of, if not his absolute best. The songs are also incredible. The Circle of Life is an epic and powerful opening song for the film, I Just Can't Wait to Be King is both fun and practically bursting with high energy, Be Prepared is a great villain song, Hakuna Matata light and humorous (it's arguably the weakest of the songs, and it's still a classic), while Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a perfectly touching romance song and completely deserved its Oscar.Like most of Disney's animated films, the animation here is top notch. Some of the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, while a few of them are almost scary (the elephant graveyard and the canyon where the stampede occurs are two prime examples)I'm writing this review less than a week after the 3-d re-release of The Lion King scored a big 30.2 mil opening weekend. This shows just how popular The Lion King has remained after all these years, and it's not hard to see why. It's a success on practically every level, with a classical story, memorable characters, epic scenes, beautiful animation, great songs, occasional humor and some truly tear-jerking moments. It's not just one of my favorite animated films but one of my favorite films period."	10
 From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.		7
 The zenith of traditional American animation.		10
 A milestone in animation!		10
 Wonderful	I love this film. All the songs are great, scratch that fantastic, scratch that masterful, scratch that no words can describe how good the songs are. These are some of the best songs I have ever heard. I mean wow are they good. The voice acting is fantastic. Everything about this film is just so entertaining. The animation is beautiful to look at. The characters are likable. The jokes can be funny. The sadness level is through the roof. I cried, and this film is so good I'm willing to admit it. Seriously this film is one of the saddest things I have ever watched. The Lion King succeeds in every way possible. I love this movie.4 stars out of 4	10
 One of, if not THE best animated film ever!		10
 Was, is and will always be the GREATEST animated film ever!!!		10
 The Greatest Disney Movie Ever and The Last of It's Kind		10
 BEST movie ever!!	This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST movie I have ever seen. The story is awesome. The characters and songs are amazing. The characters are also very likable. There is also a very wide variety of characters which makes the movie even better.My favorite character is Scar. He makes an awesome villain. Be Prepared, which is the song he sings in the movie is awesome. I think he adds a whole lot to the story. If he hadn't killed Mufasa then all the drama with Simba wouldn't have even happened.If you haven't seen this movie yet then I HIGHLY suggest you do. You won't be disappointed. Well anyway..... overall, this movie is incredible. It has amazing songs. Every single one of the characters are extremely likable. The story is great. All i really have left to say is that this is definitely the best Disney movie ever. =)	10
 the best	This is the best animated film I have ever seen. Simba, the son of king Muphasa is a lion cub that knows that one day will be his turn to become a king. But he is too fidgety and always gets into trouble and his father has to save him every time. The other problem is his uncle Scar that does not quite agree with the situation with the kingdom and develops a plan to kill his brother and become a king. This forces Simba to run away from the pride lands. He finds new friends that teach him never to look back and live his life. But the memories and some old friends remind him that he has a responsibility for his lands. Then he comes back to settle the things between him and his uncle. This movie is a good example of true friendship, faith and love. Great story, great characters, great animation, soundtrack and a lot of smart jokes. Let's not forget the voice acting(Jeremy Irons - Scar, James Earl Jones - Muphasa)that couldn't be better. I recommend it to all of you children, parents, grandparents... I saw it first when i was six and now I'm twenty and I'm still watching it. If you didn't have the chance to see it, I recommend it, and if you did see it, I recommend watching it again!:)	10
 Very touching Disney classic about survival and self-discovery for all ages that will warm your heart	THE LION KING, in my opinion, is a very touching Disney classic about survival and self-discovery for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the music. If I could have, I would have helped young Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas) get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get them to safety, since I don't drive. All in all, the music was good, the animation was perfect, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about survival and self-discovery for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it. You're in for a real treat and a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with someone close to you, and watch it. I guarantee you you'll thoroughly enjoy it.	9
 Lion King movie	I thought the movie was actually above excellent. The music in the movie was extraordinary and the acting incredible. I loved the movie so much that I could watch it over and over again and still not get board with it. The symbolism in the movie was also very well done. I can not speak more highly of the movie, even seeing it as an adult. However they should not have done it as a musical. I loved it hugely. I was amazed from beginning to end. The soundtrack was also very impressive. The movie was totally seamless. I love Elton John's music and in this soundtrack he is exceptional. Jeremy Iron's voice as Scar was perfect for the part. The actors for the voices of Simba were exceptional too.	10
 Amazing Movie That Should Never Go Away	"This movie I think is better than any other Disney movie simply because it is more ""real"" than any other one. It also has a lot more catchy music than films like Aladdin and beauty and the beast. One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing thats been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. not just some love story with problems like the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. this story actually seems like something that wasn't just made to occupy kids under the age of 5 and bore the mess out of adults. its a movie that will keep people of all ages coming for a long time."	10
 Disney's best movie	I was 7 years old when I first saw The Lion King. For the first time in my life a movie made me cry... The death of King Mufasa is so touching that even now I would let a tear. It's the first Disney-movie I saw where someone died, the first movie that confronted me, and a lot of other children, with death in a touching, though beautiful way.I find it a real pleasure to watch this movie. There are a lot of scenes which really are times to relax and enjoy, relieved by the more serious scenes such as the one mentioned above.The Lion King is a movie that offers a bit of everything. You have the music, with the one great song after the other. There's a bit of humour, where Timon and Pumbaa come in. A pinch of love and excitement. All together one of the most grand movies ever.	10
 Excellent, Just Excellent	For me, this is the greatest Disney film ever produced and one of the best films ever.It contains everything from romance to action, from happiness to sadness. You cannot get enough of this film. Disney created one magnificent film and is recommended for both children & adults. It's a film that all must see. The way Disney portrays the animals and their lands are just magnificent, and the characters are better than some modern films. The storyline is also just too good. I won't say what it is about just in case you haven't seen it yet, but, it is wicked. You must see this film.	10
 What a brilliant film!	The Lion King. I remember this coming out when I was two. I loved this film. The characters amused me so and the setting was so picture perfect. Scar was such a great character, with much power to the scene. Though the bits that upsetted me the most at this age, was Simba's dad, who died after tumbling down the cliff, after Scar plunged him down there. To be honest I am not surprised why this film was such a big hit. The characters were all likable in their own ways and you could really tell that it was a film, that was never going to be forgotten. Elton John played lovely songs and the start to the film was very much welcoming to small children and big families. This film deserves to be released time and time again!	10
 Best Disney Movie Of All Time	"I personally love movies. Love them to death. No greater one then the Lion King. Magnifcint for people of all ages. It teaches you a lot even if it is a cartoon. It teaches us to face your pass even if you don't like it. It teaches you so much that I just can't explain. I love it to death I can watch it thousands of times just to hear ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King!"" This movie has been out for over ten years and I think it's a classic you can just never out grow. It's something so powerful. Did you know that originally people thought that this movie wasn't going to do good. They thought Pocohauntas was going to be better. But they changed a lot of it just by the power of Mufasa and Simba. They made it so powerful. I just love the part when grownup Simba sees his dad in the sky and just is so confused. That scene made this movie worth remembering. I'll always love this movie no matter what. Oh and this movie also has a very great voice talent of very famous stars."	10
 One of Disney's best movies...even now.	And so we are in Pride Rock. The Lion King Mufasa and Queen Serabi have a child, which they name Simba. It all seems peaceful... but not to Scar, Mufasa's brother. Scar is obviously jealous of Mufasa for being King, so Scar plans to steal the throne. A tragedy happens and Simba runs away... Simba is then found by Timon and Pumba, a spectacular duo. Simba lives with them for awhile, until Rafiki comes in and helps Simba regain the true identity of who he really is. The story is well developed, and it's enjoyable for the whole family. The movie has an interesting soundtrack with an African twist. The voice acting was done well with all the characters. The animation was well done, but then again, this was a theatrical movie and it was still considered the old Disney. In other words... this is The greatest Disney movie of all time.	10
 The Lion King...		10
 Shakespearian movie with lions instead people	"Project instigator: Rob Minkoff, with the help of Michael Eisner, into de last serious managerial job of his career as Disney's president. I think that Minkoff must do the same that Don Bluth did and became independent.Essentially isA drama. Is the version that Shakespeare had made of Hamlet if he had been a lion and he had live in California. A male lion, with the destiny written since birth, found his life broken because the envy of his jealous uncle about his dad. In his escape to exile, tortured because he thought that he murdered his own father, he found the peace and forgot his problems. Then, he sees that escape from problems and past only makes the pain bigger, so he decided to return and change his life.Clones and Bloodsuckers: Both sequels, the third worst than the second, those movies de-valuate a very original film that gets more poetic layers every time you see it.That movie moved us becausethe great-magnify-epic music of Hanzs Zimmer and the work of the photography director, showing us those elephant graveyards and huge environments full of beautiful-not-gaudy colors, like those skies full of stars, big-fat trees and precipitous that turn into deadly hallways to the execution.A sceneSimba, that facing his father, who is represented as a cloud. The end of the scene is Simba, screaming: ""Father!!! DON'T LEAVE ME!!!"" A sequenceThe stones tremble, the walls hum and shake, and the poor Simba pup stares at the sky, while we see since his point of view a really-huge-lethal stampede that runs to his position.Watch it ifYou want to enjoy the old school Disney style into the 20th century. This is the perfect movie to watch with a lot of popcorn, after have had a session of National Geographic documentaries.Don't watch it ifyou are a squared-old fashioned racist that doesn't accept new ideas and alternative forms of moving artwork and masterpieces, I mean, good cinema."	10
 The best animated film ever.	"Disney sure has done a great job on this film and it truly deserves the title ""A Masterpiece."" I remember this film as being a big part of my life, too bad the tape got wrecked or I would have watched it a lot more. But anyway I love every aspect of this film from the animation to the storyline and the characters. I think Jeremy Irons did á great job on Scar as the creepy, sneaky and greedy villain. The music and songs in this film were a great success and they really create a perfect mood for every scene in the film. The script is also a masterpiece from the beginning to the end. Last but not least the characters were very good and a good mixture of characters and excellent casting.This is a movie that I will remember for the rest of my life and will encourage my children to watch it, but of course they do have a choice, 5/5 stars."	10
 The Best Animated Movie Ever!	"No amount of words can describe the greatness, the beauty, and the power of ""The Lion King."" I have first watched this movie when I was 5 years old and it was really fun growing up with this film. ""The Lion King"" has given me so many wonderful memories and beautiful, indescribable past moods that I can't get bored of this movie, no matter how many times I watch it. ""The Lion King"" is one of the very few movies that let you experience the power, the thrill, and majesty. With its magnificent animation; lovable and delightful characters; wonderful songs; and emotionally moving and unforgettable story, ""The Lion King"" is and always will be among the greatest films of all time. Another thing that makes this a spectacular film is the many life-lessons you can learn from it, such as pursuing your responsibilities, and taking your place in the 'Circle of Life,' and the importance and splendor of the father-son relation. ""The Lion King"" is truly the best animated movie ever!"	10

WATCH IT AND ENJOY IT!!!!!!!!"	10
 Disney's Best	Everything about The Lion King (1994) is great. Young Simba (Johnathan Taylor Thomas) is the son of the king of the animals Mufasa (James Earl Jones). After he is tricked by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) that he killed his father in a freak stampede, Simba runs off to a far off oasis where Timon and Pumba (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) live. After many years of living with his foster fathers, adult Simba (Mathhew Broderick) realizes what has happened and how Scar has come to the thrown of the animal kingdom as an evil king.Simba must return to battle Scar and return the animal kingdom to order with the help of his friend. The story is fun, its interesting, and it's smart. It's truly Disney at its best. The voices: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, and Whoopi Goldberg is stellar. The animation is at its best and the design of actual African animals is amazing. If only Disney could make more of these kind of movies.Anyone from kids to adults would like this film. There are a few scary moments but all in all it's a great kids movie.The Lion King. Starring the voices of: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Ernie Sabella, and Nathan Lane.4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.	9
 Quick reviews!!	Not only is it one of Disney's most loved films, it is one of the most successful movies of all time. A deceptively simple story, loosely built around Hamelet, with a rich cast of characters, a terrific list of voice actors, some extraordinary visuals and animation, and a few good songs make Lion King a favourite for many people, young and old.The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young cub and heir to the throne. His father Mufassa tells him from Pride Rock that someday all that simba sees will be his, as he will be the 'King of the Jungle', at the top of the food chain. More than this though, adding the human element, Simba will be the leader of all the other animals and they will look to him for guidance. However Scar, Simba's uncle believes the throne should be his, that it would have been his had Simba not been born. Scar, as he is not the alpha male must live in inferior surroundings, and against the typical rules of society he befriends the Hyenas. He plots to usurp the throne. One normal day he takes Simba across the land and into a canyon, knowing that a stampede approaches. When he leaves, Mufassa rushes to help his son and is crushed. Simba survives however, but Scar tells him to leave as everyone will blame him for his father's death. Simba goes, Scar takes over, telling everyone Simba is dead. Soon Simba meets Timon and Pumba, mere-cat and Warthog, and they become friends, following the Hakuna Matata way of life. However, when an old friend Nala appears, Simba realises he must take back his throne and stop Scar, leading to a fiery confrontation.Each character here has depth and their own individuality. The voice acting for each is perfect, from the sneering intellectualism and jealousy of Jeremy Irons as Scar, to the wisdom and strength of Mufassa, played by James Earl Jones. The animation mixes computer styles with traditional, and the result is spectacular. From the sumptuous swirling views of the land, to the grimness of Scar's habitat, much akin to Shere-Khan's in The Jungle Book, everything is highly detailed. The songs range from the typical catchy dance numbers to ballads, and they are effective. The incidental music is often more powerful. The jokes are good for the most part, with many aimed at a more knowing, older audience, and while some scenes may be too harsh for younger viewers, it is still a perfect film for kids. There is love, friendship, respect and all the other traits of Disney, as well as the darker side too, which the kids will not recognise. A break from the fairy tale style of Disney films, and not a human in sight, but a major triumph for the studio, and a great, emotional, fun film.8.5 out of 10	8
 what a great movie!	i love the lion king! its such a great movie, no matter what your age. i think the songs are wonderful and you never get tired of them. even though there are some bad parts in this movie it is still so enjoyable and amazing!!!! kids enjoy and love it, the characters are great and very dynamic. we see the characters thoughts, feelings and relationships.this movie teaches how not to take things for granted while making it fun for kids. what more can you ask in a great movie classic? there is adventure, excitement, humor, suspense, and so much more in this wonderful movie! the lion king gets top marks in my book, it will always be my favorite movie!	10
 The last GREAT hand-drawn animation movie EVER		
 Best Ever	This film in my opinion is the best disney flm ever made. Either more people go to the cinema now or Finding Nemo is the best ever.I'l give you a clue it's not the second answer.Before Finding Nemo The Lion King broke all box office records and the reason for that was this film had everything. Great story,Good voices, Good effects and most importantly fantastic music from Elton John and Tim Rice which will live in many a persons mind.If you have not seen this film yet go out buy it on the new special edition DVD and have a once in a lifetime disney experience.	10
 King of the Jungle.	The Lion Kings is with out a doubt the king of the Disney films. A marvelous movie that hit so close to home for many of us with family and honor. Every Thing works here with a spark that has not gone out for over a decade and the film will entertain for generations to come.	10
 Hands down, Disney's best animation movie ever.	With a Touch of Hamlet and a sprinkle of King Lear, The Lion Kings is a real achievement in every aspect.  A tale about coming of age and the right of destiny that has a real timeless effect on all age groups.  Not only is this movie such a monumental film in animation but is an achievement in motion picture scoring as well. Elton John and Tim Rice not only bring a great soundtrack to this epic but accompanies it with a sense of style that has not be duplicated ever since its release.A real Disney classic in every sense of the word, and a real keeper for generations to come.	10
 With apologies to my friend Sara:	"Animation's crowning achievement? I don't think so! Sure it looks great, sounds great (except for that annoying ""Can you feel the love tonight""), made tons of money, but it certainly pales compared to something like Beauty and the Beast. If anything deserves to be called ""Animation's Crowning Achievement"", it's Beauty and the Beast (And I usually don't go around giving praise to Disney's non-Pixar films!). In that, you have a connection to the characters that is noticeably lacking in this film (And the music and story are better too.).The Lion King is ok, not great, but ten times better than its sequel. I'd still rather curl up with Toy Story or Monsters Inc. than this though."	
 The Best Animated Film Ever	I really wonder what made you guys rate this movie 17th in the animation list. That ranking, according to me is a total farce. This movie just can't be 17th. It is the best. It deserves to be the best. It is totally awssome. Out of the world. The story about a young  lion cub, Simba, the heir to the throne of the jungle-Pride Rock and his journey upto there is beautiful. This is one movie you just can't miss. Believe me, those who think this movie is childish should go jump in the well. It is a total exhilirating experience. Don't miss it for anything. 12 out of 10 from me.	10
 It is time!!		10
 Perfect.	It was perfect...It changed my life <And you can't say that about too many films>	10
 Pure magic!		10
 How cute! How funny! How touching!	One of the best Disney features ever and a true classic. Great songs with scenes that make the screen explode with color. The story is also exciting and touching at some points with plenty of instant-classic characters.If you didn't see it, you MUST. Pure fun with loads of imagination. The sequel is not as good, but.. Heh.. Ok.Hakuna Matata!	10
 The Most Wonderful Story Ever		10
 The best animated film ever made	The film is quite simply the best ever cartoon to hit the silver screen. The voices, music and story line (including an ecological message) make it stand out in this genre. Kids will still love this film in 50 years.Timon and poomba should have one best supporting animated creatures at the oscars!!!	10
 The Animated Movie to end all Movies...	"The Lion King is Disney's greatest animated work ever to be released in the world. It inter-twines the most heart-felt story to all the characters to add onto the pure perfected-ness to this animated feature. The all-star cast, created a strong atmosphere to all the characters, conveying emotion, humor, and anxiety. The songs were awe-inspiring and very elaborate, from ""Circle Of Life"" to ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"". I have no intention to bash this film at any right. Disney has reached pure greatness to this smash hit. ****"	10
 First Class Animation	For me, this animated motion picture is really one of my favourites. Its plot, character depth and storyline is very, very good. But I like the score best of all. They are very emotional and adds life to the movie. What's more, The Lion King, in my opinion, is the best Disney animation of all time. It really touches me and give me inspiration for my life. Overall, this is the best.	10
 Stupid	Hyenas are now hated for this stupid movie. And lions are not the kings of the beasts. It just sucks! It is my least favorite movie of all time. If I was to chose between watching the lion king and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, I would chose Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. I have no idea what people see in this movie. I would give it a negative number if I could. HYENAS KILL LIONS! I just hate it. TIGERS ARE THE KINGS OF THE BEASTS! NOT LIONS! I have to say, I was very disappointed, the only good thing was the music. Honestly, I wish those lions starved to death and I am glad that simbas father died. I hate Disney for making people hate hyenas. I LOVE THOSE GUYS! They are AMAZING! In fact, I like them better than humans! I just can't wait to be king. To bad you will have to wait forever. By the way, wildebeest can not trample and ADULT MALE LION! Way to go on the details there. Disney has to make a movie about hyenas being good because honestly, hyenas are not more evil than humans. AND THAT IS A FACT!	1
 Disney at it's worst		4
 Cheesy and predictable, but has its moments		5
 Not Disney's best movie, I ought to tell you	"So I didn't give this movie 10 stars, are you fans all mad at me? Anyway, this movie is often a fan favourite of many of my friends. Ever since one of my classmates in English class began singing Hakuna Matata, often to annoy me, I have been analyzing this movie and trying hard not to make any fan of this movie mad at me.But I'm getting sidetracked. While the animation (and artwork in general) is astounding and clearly had a lot of effort put in, I find that the story seems to have not as much effort put in.Based on the Shakespeare play Hamlet (and Kimba the White Lion, but I'll get to that later), this film revolves around a lion who, after losing his father to his envious uncle Scar, is convinced to remember his past and that HE should rightfully claim the throne. I like the message that the past can hurt and you can run from it or learn from it, but I feel a lot doesn't work for me.For example, the plot (as I mentioned before) is derived from two great works of fiction. It wouldn't bother me as much if the end credits said ""Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Kimba the White Lion by Osamu Tezuka"" or if Disney didn't tout it as an original story.Then there's one of my biggest issues with this movie, this movie doesn't know if it wants to be for younger children (3-6) or older children (7-12). While it does deal with mature subjects such as the death of a loved one, responsibility, handling guilt etc, there's too much other stuff in this movie that's immature.It goes without saying that when a protagonist experiences a tragic turn of events, the first thing we want is something that will cheer us up afterwards... for many, Hakuna Matata comes to mind, but... for me, I think there could have been a better way of accomplishing that.Speaking of which, I find only three of the songs from this movie worth listening to, Circle of Life (kudos to Hans Zimmer), Be Prepared (who doesn't admire a song as awesome as this?) and the end credits version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (Gotta listen to more Elton John, though). As you might have guessed, Hakuna Matata, while it may have appealed to me some 6-7 years earlier, is now the song I hate the most from this movie. It just blows my mind that a movie like this goes from a lion cub witnessing the murder of his father by a jealous uncle to one of the most annoying and whimsical songs I have ever heard as well as belching and flatulence jokes... see what I mean when I say it's not very clear on the audience it wants to appeal to? I am in disbelief that the guy who wrote songs for Princess Diana's funeral actually wrote a song as annoying as that.Also, there are scenes in this movie that are too intense for younger children, such as the death of Mufasa, the hyena chasing Simba and Nala, Simba and Nala (grown up, and before they recognize each other) fighting and the climax. I would strongly recommend waiting until your kids are 6 or 7 years old, or if they understand how hard it is to handle the death of a loved one.But what I really like about this movie is the father-and-son connection between Simba and Mufasa, which is one of the reasons why you're supposed to find it sad when Mufasa dies, just like why we're supposed to sympathize with Bambi when his mother dies. Whenever you watch Mufasa and Simba conversing happily, you just know there's a connection between the two.Overall, this movie is not bad, but not everything is flawless, and this is no exception. For any fan seething with anger at this review, I see some good stuff in this movie!"	6
 A lovely but completely unoriginal film.	"Aside from the folks at Disney, anyone else my age who saw both the Japanese series ""Kimba"" and ""The Lion King"" could easily see that the Disney film was based almost completely on the earlier Japanese cartoon. Now I am no lover of ""Kimba""--its American version was rather insipid. But the plot was clearly 'borrowed' by Disney to make ""The Lion King"". And, there are so many similarities that I cannot rate this wonderful film any higher than an 8--as it lacks originality. Sure, I loved Ed and felt my heart tugged by the film and loved the music--but it was a ripoff, ur....I mean 'very similar'. Not a bad film at all, but I recommend you try seeing the Japanese show if you can find a copy. Even the main character's names are practically the same!"	8
 Don't ask me why but this movie sucks	The Lion King is one of the worst movies ever made. This movie uses slapstick and other juvenille tricks for the humor. This movie is aimed at little kids. I hate this movie and I always will. Damn the lion king ! Damn it to hell!	1
 The honest voice, of this movie being too old and lame in terms of quality compared to titles of this time.	This movie is way too overrated to be in the top 1000 of any lists. Why? This movie's plot is way too generic. A lot of movies that were made before this had the same plot of someone trying to impress the people around him and becoming the hero while a villain tries to stop them. Movies like avatar are WAY underrated for their fantastic storyline and effects. Be sure to like this review, so people can get their ratings right to today's times, and not let NOSTALGIA get in the way of honest ratings. If you haven't watched this movie as a child, you definitely won't enjoy it watching it now. This is not the only one, as series like avatar: the last airbender also confuse people into thinking that the movie Avatar is in any way linked to that series, which is not true at all. It's all nostalgia feelings and will pass when the next generation of people who haven't watched this empty movie will start writing reviews.	1
 Good film but overrated		5
 Poor...	"What could I say ? Disney simply copied one of the most popular japanese animated series and destructed it ! What makes me laugh is that Disney pretended to have worked hours and hours on the backgrounds (if you see a good one, phone me !)...God ! If you want to see the real one, go see ""Jungle Taitei"", you'll see something really different !"	2
 Surprisingly violent	"I usually enjoy Disney cartoons. However, I remember first seeing this film on the big screen in 1994 and thinking how Disney could have green lit this film with so much cartoon violence.Sure, the story is one of self discovery and finding one's place in the ""circle of life"". But there are many, many ways to tell the story without senseless violence. I played the film for some small children a few months back and they cried because of the death that happens during the Stampede.To be honest, I can't put my finger on it, but there's just something about this film that makes it unlike the other Disney cartoons and very, very depressing.By the way, the word SEX appears twice in this film. No, it's not the suggested ""SFX"" and no it's not ""unitentional."" I will never watch this film if I don't have to; I would rather watch the Chipmunks. 2/10."	2
 I had a heart attack 15 minutes into watching this	I ODed on the syrupy Circle of Life. After leaving the hospital & watching more I realized TLK is really Mission: Impossible - Lion Style in disguise.Simba replaces Tom Cruise.Zazu the bird replaces Simon Pegg.Nala replaces Julia Stiles or another M:I actressScar, the nasty uncle, replaces the Head of The Syndicate.Hyenas replace all The Syndicate henchmen.and so on & so on.	4
 Two Thumbs Down!	This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.I will give you a few reasons because of that.One is it's too mushy,most Disney Movies are much better than this.Second this is a very violent movie, seriously I mean with all that killing and stuff.Another is the animals have vial table manners. They just gulp down food like the big bad wolf.Also the jungles don't look colorful enough.There should be more deatails.5th there are not cool animals like market young children won't understand that.I myself was saying boo in the theater.I can't believe we got the the DVD.If you like films about the wild I suggest Dreamwork's Madagascar.Letter Grade:F Number Grade 1/10	1
 Woow	I like it enjoyed this movie recommendation for you guys animal lovers	6
 Its all right...		7
 Movie Review Profits	Play The Lion King! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!	9
 My favorite animated film.		10
 a must see movie!	A great movie that everyone should see regardless of his age.A film that has been printed in my memory from my childhood and has learned me a lot.Especially kids will learn the meaning of love,betrayal,friendship and that finally everyone takes what he deserves from life depending his behaviοr.Simba is a symbol of strength,despite of the fact that he leaves from his herd because he feels responsible for the death of his father,he finds the courage finally with the help of his friends Timon and Pumbaa and of course from his puppy friend which converted to his love to go back,face all the difficulties and take the responsibilities for his herd as a leader. A really great movie which is for me the best animation I have ever seen!	9
 One of the best animated movies I ever watched	I watched this movie first in 2000 when I was 4. I was then too young to realize it. But when I was young enough to realize it, I watched it again. To be honest, This movie is awesome. It is one of the best animated movies I ever watched.This is a film that can entertain anyone young or old. It was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! I believe that The Lion King will Shine and still Roar with Success in next decades too. I highly recommend you all to watch this movie. Also don't miss the sequel of it.	9
 The Greatest Film? Well, Near it		10
 Deserving of all the love in the world.		10
 Beautiful, funny and moving, even for grown ups	From an adult audience perspective: Highly entertaining, funny, and ultimately quite moving. It manages to be digestible for kids, but meaty enough for anyone older.Some great voicing -- especially by Jeremy Irons. The songs are good, and most of the animation is quite beautiful. It has its occasional sappy moments, and the basic plot is old as the hills, but its all done very, very well. Not as sophisticated as some of the Pixar films, but I not ashamed to admit it made me it made me laugh and cry - both times I've seen it. How many current Hollywood films, animated or not, can you say that about?	9
 Strong and engaging animation film that has its issues and its messages but delivers on an entertaining level above all else.		7
 From one who experienced it at the right age	being born in 1991 i was about 3 when I first watched The Lion King. I have not watched it since about 1997 so why do I believe myself to be in a position to comment on a film I barely remember watching? I remember the way it made me feel as I sat in the cinema. I freely admit that I cried when Mufassa died and cannot recall a second in the film that did not either amuse or move me. I am severely irritated by those who complain that the film is too scary and overrated. The film is not for you!!! It is so easy to inspire emotion in a little child and Lion King did so much of that. People who watched the film when they were 26 and complain about the 'lack of intricacies in the subplot' or the 'lack of consistent character development' should check themselves into a mental asylum. I guess I haven't watched Lion King for so long because i want to maintain the effect it had on me as a child. This is by far the most overly sacharrine thing i have ever written in my life but its for a good cause. Lion King forever.	10
 Lovable for generations to come	Yeah, I'm 12 years old, and I love this movie so much. It was the fist movie that was released after i was born,so I have literally watched it so many times i have it memorized. but i still love it. It's funny, very well written, and the color and drawing is incredible. This is one of those movies that we need to show our kids. i will definitely show this movie to my future kids, and my grandkids. it teaches lessons that most movies don't. Disney has the great tradition of creating movies that matter; I think that in Disney's early days (snow white, lion king, Cinderella, etc.) they made the best movies. But now it's more cheesy sequels to movies long ago (like Cinderella's follow-ups; hello, not needed) or real-life stories that happened like 50 years ago. Lion King is the perfect movie for everyone.	9
 Whoa!	"Whoa!! When I Was Like 4 Years Old My Mom Use To Put Me TO Watch This Movie And Even though I Did Not Really Understand It When I Was Young I Still Liked It Now I'm 14 And I'm Watching This Movie Over And Over Again I Cant Stop Watching It! This Is The Best Movie I've Ever Seen Along With ""The Lion King 2"" And ""The Lion King One And A Half"" I'm Waiting For More Lion King Movies To Come Out!! And The Lion King Is Better Than Any Other Disney Movie I Think Instead Of A Mickey Mouse Logo It Should Be An Lion King Logo, I Love Everything About It I Can Say So Many Things I Love About It, I Love The Songs, I love The Story, I Love That This Movie Can Make You Cry, Laugh , Happy And When I Say Cry I Mean Like When Mufasa Dies And When I Say Laugh I Mean Like When Timon & Pumba And When I Say Happy Is So Many Parts Like When Nala And Simba Finally Meet Up After Years Or When Simba Came Back Or When Simba Met Up With His Father Mufasa."	10
 The awesomeness movie in the world	"This is a very awesome,inspired,funny and coolest cartoon movie.I love it,even I saw it a billion times,it's SO cool!Simba is SO cute!Yessire...I saw the lion king 2 but I always prefers the first one:""the lion king""If I was instant of Simba,I'll kill Scar by now O_o....He's life is too much of evil for me x D.I always think Simba is a more passion,energy cub.But he's not listening to you well :O.I always think that they work certainly hard on this movie and it's always very popular,you know :D The actor of voice,background,character design,storyline,artwork and all all all are SO ""PUUR-FECT"" And for now,more peoples get inspired like Kay,Ev1 and many of my idols or awesome artist are getting inspired of drawing because of this movie.I always hope I can always improve...ONE DAY."	10
 The Lion King	I really love this movie. I love all Disney movies. They are really just necessary movies to watch in my opinion. I personally LOVE the songs in the movie. Props to Elton John and Tim Rice for excellent composing. My favorite character is Zazu, even thought they are all wonderful. I love James Earl Jones' distinct voice. It really is empowering just listening to it. I really like Timomn and Pumbaa for taking Siba in when he's a kid. I sing along with the songs throughout the whole movie. I just LOVE 'The Cirle Of Life'. I really love Hakuna Mutata. You can't not know this song. Everyine knows this song and must love it! They must love everything about this movie, because I do!	10
 Original Masterpiece	The Lion King has to be one of the best films i've ever watched. Not only was it an original piece written during the production, but it was one of the first films that dealt with animals as having such human characteristics, making the audience able to relate to it. Watching it for the first time as a young child, I was impressed by the way it dealt with the difficult subjects of death and responsibility. The characters had a lot of depth to them, making it more realistic, There were original jokes and all of the catchy tunes that were made for film were inkeeping with the cultures and country's it was set itFor these reasons and many besides, this is why I have given this film a 10, (something I quite rarely do)Haz	10
 An Explanation of Greatness.	"I believe this movie was a great tribute to all animation, and something that every movie should hope to accomplish. That's one reason why Disney calls it a ""Masterpiece"". It has a great story, animation, moving music, and some of the most emotional scenes I've seen in an animated movie. Besides those facts....it has great connections to people in everyday life....who have lost a loved one, and found another. I hadn't seen that movie in so long, and when I did, I was instantly sucked in. It is the ONLY animated movie I have ever seen, that has such great effects over people. Everyone I have met in terms of fans are great, intelligent people, and this movie truly does include the ""magic"" that Disney, and such a great movie was hoping to achieive."	10
 My comments are fair.	"The Lion King is one Disney's favorites to children and adults. This movie takes my breath away as well as many others. I fall in love with it every time I see it. I also find it hilarious how it relates to Hamlet and the some of Hitler's reign on Germany. Every child should see this movie in able to have a joyous childhood. The music sweeps my heart away. It is rare to see in a Disney movie the father die. It brings tears to my eyes to see Mufassa die but I come right back with Timon and Pumbaa making me laugh and sing with ""Hakuna Matata"". I know I will be watching The lion King for years to come. See this movie. This movie sweeps the hearts of the viewers off to Africa for an hour and a half to an adventure everyone should experience."	10
 Another stereotype	I first saw this movie when I was 10 and cried when Mustafa died. I loved it. However, I watch it as an adult and see some sad stuff. Disney has sought to create movies about various cultures. That's admirable, however, in this particular film about Africa, everyone is an animal. This links to the stereotype of Black beastiality. Also, the voices have only 2 black actors behind them and there's an English voice for Scar. Are they saying that Blacks can't even play themselves? This movie could have worked just as well with humans in Africa. Why wasn't that an option? Whites have all their numerous films, Native Americans got Pochahontas, People of Mideastern descent got Aladdin, Asians got Mulan, blacks get The Lion King. I see something quite wrong with that. I know that it's a beloved movie, but also think about what it's saying to little kids about Africa.	
 a bit mundane		5
 Fairly Overrated (Especially compared to other movies)	This is a wonderful movie, I must say, overall, the best children's movie I can think of! But it's overrated, especially in comparison to other movies: shortly below The Lion King, is To Kill a Mockingbird, an American classic, while the movie is certainly not as good as the book, I can promise you, it is far more thoughtful, intelligent, and overall deep than The Lion King, that is just considering the story, but I don't think the animators broke any new ground. Contrary to popular belief this is most certainly not the greatest Disney movie, American Disney, kids Disney, yes... However, over in Japan, lies Studio Ghibli, I suppose comparable to Pixar, in its association w/ Disney. And they have made Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke,and be cautioned they are not children's films. And if you look online you'll find several people who can point out that several Disney movies are essentially just kid's versions of many classic and original Shakespeare plays.	7
 The Best Film Ever Made		10
" Great cast and beautiful animation, plus the ""circle of life"" story make this a winner."	"My comments may contain some SPOILERS. I believe everyone knows the story already, but please take note, you may not want to read further if you have not seen ""The Lion King.""The Lion King follows a formula similar to other Disney animated movies, like Tarzan and Dinosaur. An orphaned baby is raised by a strange species, the baby eventually grows up to figure out what his real role is, then fights and beats an erstwhile 'leader' to claim the 'leader of the pack.' In this movie, Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is next in line for king, after his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). But evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) wants to be king, cooperates with hyenas, causes a stampede forcing Mufasa to rescue young cub Simba, Mufasa dies at the paws of his brother Scar, who then tells Simba to run, assuming the hyenas will eat him. The cub eludes the hyenas through a brier patch, but almost dies in the desert, buzzards surround him, when a weasel and his warthog come along, the warthog butts the birds out of the way, yelling ""bowling for buzzards!""So, the unlikely pair befriend young Simba, and he grows up into a magnificent young lion, spitting image of his dad. (The young Dinosaur had been raised by lemurs, the young Tarzan by apes, similar themes.) Meanwhile Scar as king causes all the animals but hyenas to leave, their home becomes a desolate wasteland. Simba is lured back by his ""duty"" after seeing an image of dad in the clouds, challenges Scar, mates with his cub hood girlfriend, and a new cub is presented. ""The circle of life."" Symbolically, the moment Scar is chased away, rains begin, their homeland will become restored to its former glory, with Simba as king!"	
 My son loves it,therefore I love it	This is a great story,with excellent voice casting and the usual great animation we have come to expect from Disney.The only possible problem I have with this film would be the final fight scene with Simba and Scar.This is somewhat disturbing and a little too excessive and violent for my taste.Most importantly, my 2 year old son loves this film,and whatever my son loves, naturally I am going to love too.Throw in an excellent score by Tim Rice and Elton John (my childhood hero),and you can chalk up another classic for the folks at Disney.	8
 Simple, effective African panorama		10
 Annoying movie	"Simply put, ""The Lion King"" sucks. I am so sick of people praiseing this movie like its the best thing since color TV. After watching several Disney films from the 60's, 80's, and 90's, I STILL fail to see way this movie is like some people's bible. I don't think this film is any where near the best Disney film. It had great art quality and an excellent proformance by James Earl Jones, and Matthew Broderick. Thats it. Everything else about it sucked. The story was so weak, I was bored before I new it. The more the public praises this movie, the more I hate this movie. If you want the best Disney movies, try TARZAN, ALADDIN, or THE LITTLE MERMAID. Any one who thinks this is the best disney movie is basicly an idiot/moron. I think people should watch at LEAST 25 Disney classics before they start picking out ""BEST DISNEY MOVIES"". I have seen several and Lion King is fare from the best. For example, if Jurassic Park was the only Dinosaur movie you had ever seen, It world be idiotic to say that it is the ""BEST DINOSAUR MOVIE"" ever. To say such a thing, you would have to see several other Dinosaur movies first."	
 An overrated not as good as other Disney films movie	I know this is one of Disney's most popular animated films, but I don't see why it's so great. It was funny a little but also it had dark elements to it like Hunchback of Notre Dame. The story line was eh and wasn't very exciting. The characters weren't great either and the acting was also eh. Not a terrible film, but not nearly as good as everyone says it is. The irony is that the voice actor of Mufassa is also the same voice actor of Darth Vader. Since Disney now owns Star Wars.	4
 A despicable film.	Though some of the animation is of superb quality, this is a despicable film, full of crypto- Nazi, homophobic, born-to-rule, pseudo-spiritual, arrogant gobbledygook.This film would be the worst possible influence for any child.The films of Leni Reifenstahl taught us that beautiful images can convey a sinister message.You would think that the Disney Company, who's far-right founder thought that Werner von Braun made a peachy host for children's television, would have learned by now.	
 HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!! I HATE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!	The Lion King?!?!? MORE LIKE THE LION LOSER!!!!!! THIS IS DEBATABLY ONE OF THE WORST DISNEY MOVIES OF THE 90S!!!!!! A RIPOFF OF KIMBA THE WHITE LION!!!!!!!!! The plot is generic, the characters have no likability at all and do not have any development in them, and the songs are some of the worst that I've ever heard in my life!!!!!!!! Its 2019 remake was worse!!!!!!! Whatever you do, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS ATROCITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
 tragic	Long live the king :((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((((	3
 The end of an era...		7
 Lovable lions....	This was one of the first modern animated movies I had seen and I did enjoy it. I went into watching this thinking I wouldn't like it at all and did so that's a plus.I liked this movie in many ways. Obviouysly it was very sweet and touching and the complete aura of realism was there for an animated picture. There were moments I cried, the story was just so touching and I can see why this movie was..is.. so big.However, as much as I liked it, I don't think it was as good as Shrek(just my opinion-I KNOW many will disagree with me on this one!)Shrek probably makes my 50 top films ever. Lion King however was a major influence for me because had I not liked it, I may not have given other similar films a chance.One thing about Lion King. It was heavier then I thought it would be. There's some tough to watch scenes and I was a little surprised they'd be there in a movie that so many children would be seeing. I was expecting a much lighter movie but it was a beautiful film.However, although I wouldn't put this in the same category as Shrek(meaning, for me, I wouldn't necessarily want to watch it over and over as with Shrek) I'd still give it a well above average rating. Lion King was an extremely well done, moving picture.	7
 The first movie i ever watched	The Lion King is the first movie i ever watched at around 6 years old.It such a bright, emotional, fun and heart felt movie.The only flaw I can say is the sequels that I have yet to see look bad and Lion King 2019 is very awful.Stick to this one movie and you are set for life.	10
 The music bugged me... and story lacked		2
 The lion king is a clishè!	Lion king is a movie that is close to a lot of people's heart, but if you see it from the outside of this childhood nostalgia it really isn't that great. If you haven't seen this movie yet, no need to do it. The plot is strong but it is a moral clishé. Nothing really good or really bad about it so it gets a 5/10	5
 Meh!	"I have always loved Disney animations with a few exceptions and this, I am afraid, is one of them. The actual animation is pretty good, though I hate the anthropomorphism of the animals and the dreadful americanisation of the young lions' voices.Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons are the best things in it. The most dreadful thing about the film, though, is the music. Horrible ""modern"" pop does not work for me and Elton John /Tim Rice combo was a bad choice for writers. I am watching it now as I type and like it even less than I thought I did. I guess an old curmudgeon like me was never the target audience for this as I am aware of it's huge success with most of the cinema-going public. I hanker for the days of Pinocchio, Snow White and Bambi - they never seemed to be as cynical as this movie. They were made with love and commitment rather than an exercise in multimedia marketing."	2
 Good, Not Great	Animated feature films...nobody does 'em better than Disney.  The Lion King is not at the top of the pack, though.  The story is a little on the dark side, and fails to get a grip on the morality it intends to impart.  Somehow the food chain does not lend itself to chirpy song-and-dance.  Especially if you're pretty far down it.Also the characterizations (with the exception of Irons' Scar) are not up to the high standards of the Disney organization.  Ditto for the songs.You won't be wasting your money on rental, it's just that Disney has done better.	8
 Damn	I wish I could rank this higher, but considering the material that this film stole from that isn't possible	4
 On the fence again!		6
 Too dark for kids	I know that this movie is absolutely atmospheric and the image detail and score are wonderful (hence the 3 stars) but as a Disney animation for the family, it is NOT appropriate for kids 6 years and under. I have an almost-6-year-old daughter and a 4-and-a-half year old and they aren't wimps, but The Lion King had far too much tension, dark moments, chase/fire scenes for them. My daughters couldn't even finish the movie, I had to turn it off before half way. However, for +10 year olds it is fine. I remember watching it when I was 16 and really enjoyed it (but I wasn't bothered with watching it again: another reason it gets less than five stars, I only give more than 5 stars to movies I want to and have watched more than once).	3
 Yawns over roars	"The adulation this flick receives completely mystifies me.  Dramatically, musically and artistically, it's one of Disney's least distinguished animated entries.  What it DOES have for it is Disney's slickest blend of radio-ready pop songs, celebrity voices, mumbo-jumbo eco-politics, anemic plot, pre-stuffed animals, and slapstick buffoonery.  Commercial alchemy on this level is rare indeed, and try as it might the Mouse-House hasn't been able to top ""The Lion King"" yet.  (As for the animation itself, it's impressive but far too grounded in realism.  Give me the lines and angles of ""101 Dalmatians"" any day.)Spun so neatly, ""The Lion King"" is a cinematic confection- tasty as cotton candy and with just about as much texture."	5
 I am so tired of this movie.	"I wasn't going to comment on this one, but I was inspired by the review before me.  This person along with thousands of others obviously have seen a different ""The Lion King""  than me because the one I saw was mediocre at best.  Although I still give it a five, I think that it is unquestionably the worst Disney epic ever.  I find the music to be extremely forgettable, if not downright irritating at some points, and the plotline erratic.  And don't get me started about the nonexistent love story which we are supposed to buy.  This movie also breaks several Disney rules which I have come to expect, like the mysterious singing from the heavens (almost all Disney epics have all the music sung by actual characters).  To make a long rant short,  I disliked this enough that I have not seen a Disney cartoon since."	5
 The one you want to be in the future	"The whole process of the film is easy, the whole process is like a comedy, but the character of Simba, but let me see an adult world-compete for power and profit. At that time, I was thinking in my heart, what kind of person would I be if I leave my parents and my hometown after that? Am I going to be that little lion?Now when I grow up, I understand that everyone has their own emotions in their lives. It's just that we will be aware of ourselves consciously, and better use our emotions to develop our advantages. When Simba saw Mufasa leaving, he was desperate, and he roared loudly, ""No"". Such scenes made me cry, and I really felt that my mother was so great. Later, I realized that between children and parents is responsible for each other 's lives. Raising children is a responsibility and life experience, not deliberate. If you want your child to repay yourself, you should not impose your unfulfilled life aspirations on the child. More should be to let go, and let go more and more every day until you can only see his back.Looking at ""The Lion King"" again, what I saw is no longer the same. When I saw Xiao Simba, I always thought that I had killed my father. When facing this pain, he chose to use the method that everyone would use-escape . I don't want to start in front of others. I have to suffer every time I have to go through it. This may be the way most of us deal with problems in reality. When faced with a problem, I want to avoid it, instead of thinking about the result I want, and what can I do to solve the problem.Choosing to escape will only become an unfinished experience. Pain will live in your body forever. When you touch it, it will hurt. We can only truly face our unfinished experience, discover it, and experience it. Will really take away such pain.No matter when, what we need to do is to face all the problems bravely, accept everything happening, live a good life every day, look forward, no matter whether your past is good or bad, the achievements are today 's you, that You want to be you in the future.To borrow the most classic passage from ""The Lion King"": Some people live to the age of 75 but never stop at the age of 25; some people play countless ways of life, some people copy the same day countless times. Therefore, growth and suffering should bring ""results"", not ""consequences""."	8
 rate	Very boring movie. Cause was screened by a cartoon. I hope that next films will be more interesting than this one. I could recommend of cource to watch it at once, but that's all	5
 The Loin King: typical Disney dreck	Annoying songs, flat characters, derivative plot, looks like we've got a Disney movie. I seriously can't figure out why this is in the top 100.	1
 I wanted Scar to win	"This is one of the most popular Disney movies around - The Lion King. Everybody knows about this movie. This movie, The Lion King, has the ""most"" popular Disney villain called Scar. It is Scar who reigns supreme when it comes to the ultimate Disney villain; in other words, Scar is the number one Disney villain. I really like the way Scar looks in this movie - his design is so likeable. There are dozens of other Disney villains, but I don't think anyone of them comes close to Scar. Just look at the things he has done in this movie. He's willing to take down his own family just so he can rule. Which other Disney villain comes close? That's how great The Lion King actually is. Scar is what makes this movie succeed. I don't know about you, but I actually wanted Scar to win, and be the new king. Maybe because Scar was fit enough to lead and rule, but that just proves how dark and menacing Scar actually was. Scar is the one that likes to be in power that's for sure. It's not one of my favourite Disney movies, but Scar is one of my favourite Disney villains. The Lion King was a very good Disney movie, and is a favourite for many."	
 Above average to great movie but	Had to take a star off not for being a copy of another movie/series, that's fine and all, but the underhanded way used of trying to hide that fact.	7
 Scheetjes	The Lion King is een film over Poemba en scheetjes.	7
 Nice and emotional	The Lion King is a nice movie and among the darkest Disney movies(a brother killing a brother is very sad).Voice acting is great,especially Scar.We have fun in Timon and Pumbaa .Nice one .9,5/10	10
 The Lion King is Amazing!	The Lion King is an amazing animated film, for decades. One of the best Disney animated film, that will make you believe. And it will make you laugh and cry on so many things you've always wanted to see.	10
 Pretty Good	This is an alright movie. I would have liked it more if the animation was computer generated so that all the animals look real and but not quite. What can I say? I love me some uncanny valley.	4
 The Lion King review	The Lion King (1994) is a mixed bag for me. While the first half of the feature was well- executed, the second half somewhat felt too rushed/convenient - which kinda made it less satisfying. That being said, the songs are as always energetic and colourful. The characters are likable, Timon & Pumbaa were amusing, but all the credit goes to Scar especially, he stole the show, both as an entertainer and as a complex villain. Final verdict: It is good but it does suffer from some flaws, but for some reason people keep praising it as if it was a masterpiece. In short, I think it's overrated.	6
 This is overrated	It is just a kids movie. It is no big deal. 10 out of 10 come on. This is not a good movie. Did it is great if you are kid. I am 35 I do not care about this movie any more.	4
 A great classic	A fun, hilarious timeless movie for all ages. The 2D animation still looks good and the voice acting is fabulous. It's certainly more funny than the remake, but I still rather love the remake more - but that's not for this review.It's rather tense, but also heartwarming, and emotional. It has a nice message. I wouldn't say it was one of Disney's best animated classics, but it certainly is a really great one.This is one you will want to watch time and time again.	9
 Best movie I've seen in a While	I've lost hope in modern movies, so I went to the classics. The Lion King is the greatest movie ever!	10
 This movie is overrated!	Seriously, don't get me started on the fact they stole a song from Fred and the Nature Gang.	10
 Did not feel so great	The movie just felt above average.The songs was average and just a kingdom betrayal story.Not in the best list of my personal favourite animated movies.	6
 A review for the ages	It's pretty great, what can I say? Its The Lion King.	8
 Falls short of the hype; poorly-paced, lacking in proper emotional investment and, sometimes, quite dull.		5
 For those crazy conspiracy theorists out there, you know what I'm talking about.	I swear to god it said SEX in the sky. It did not say SFX, nor did it say THX, it said SEX, plain and simple. I know this may come as a surprise to some of you, but this was all part of the Illuminati's grand plan to subjugate the entire planet. Please do not resist your new reptilian overlords, for I have met their leader, and he is very kind. He goes by the name of Leafy, and he promises that he will be a most merciful leader if paid his proper tribute of Mountain Jew and Doritos every month. All that he asks in return is for no one to refer to him as a cyberbully, for cyberbullies are cruel, evil, vicious creatures, and Leafy is not.Now that you have been informed of your inevitable takeover I will take my leave and return to our new glorious leaders side, to advise and council, to drink and make merry, and to watch the rest of mankind suffer as we drown you all in Mountain Dewrito mixture and Jacob Sartorius songs.Other then that it's a good movie.8/10	8
 Not bad but highly overrated.	The Lion King gets much praise. Of course one can see why. The movie has great animation. Most of the characters are put together well and of course it has memorable music. Two of the songs were big hits in the 90's.So before I get on TLK's faults I will start with the good. The Lion King has great animation. It was Disney's best animation to date and most 2D movies never came close to surpassing TLK style animation. Now for the characters. I love Timon and Pumbaa. These two were great comedy relief for this film. I loved Mufasa and I hate that he had to die, but I realize that it was an important part of the film, involving the theme of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Rafiki is also quite funny. And those loathsome but lovable hyenas. The only characters I don't like are the main ones. Simba is annoying as a cub and even more as an adult. He's so stubborn as an adult that he has to have sense knocked into him about his past, instead of just finding out his destiny for himself. And the villain Scar, comes off as too weak.I guess my biggest problem with TLK is that, it is simply overrated. All the merchandise that was pumped out for this movie and its sequels was massive. I don't think Frozen could come close to the explosion of Lion King toys.On a whole TLK is not a horrible movie, I just don't think it is Disney's best. Most people do and that's fine. I think Beauty and The Beast is better than TLK. But don't take my word for it if you feel differently.	5
 One of the most important animated films ever	This is one of the most popular and important Disney animated movies of all time. It's dark, emotionally stirring, and hard to watch at times. It has a great story about revenge and although the plot isn't entirely original, the movie handles it so well that it didn't bother me. The intro is very memorable and it will forever be remembered as one of the best movie intros of all time. I'm not going to spoil anything but a particular characters death is handled so well that it made most people cry bitter tears regardless of their age. It's probably the most saddest scene for any animated film. Like most Disney animated films, it offered adult themes which makes it good and enjoyable for grown ups as well. With some Disney films my nostalgia wears off but with this film, it gets better every time I watch it. Its final act has more action then you'd expect to find in a Disney film. I did rather enjoy the ending scene. Also, it has one of if not the best movie soundtrack of all time too. It perfectly fit the mood and setting of the movie and it's pretty catchy. It's a must see for all animated movie fans,	7
 Wonderful Movie!	This is a wonderful movie for all ages. I loved it when I was younger and I still love it now. There is one scene that I believe has some shaman chanting but I could be wrong. The animation is great, the songs are fun, and it has an interesting plot line. I was intrigued throughout the entire movie and I quite enjoyed the ending. This movie is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. I feel it is ridiculous that this review has to be ten lines so please disregard the following: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Sorry for that. :)	9
 The King Of The Disney Renaissance Era	I have the Diamond Edition of this movie on Blu-Ray and even to this day, The Lion King is one of the greatest movies that Disney has ever made. This is the movie gave Disney Renaissance a big name, a story based on Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', with great actors like James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane. Many memorable songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice, like 'Hakuna Matata' and 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' that to this day, even the younger viewers of classic Disney films love to listen too. This movie has to be one greatest animated movies of all time and its certainly one of my favourite films ever. Their are a few dark scenes that children from around 1-5 would get scared of, so this movie is good for kids around 8 - 12, but its a movie for everyone, if you're a fan of classic Disney movies then I suggest to see this movie, buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray its still in stores.	10
 to be, or not to be, that is the question?	"When i watched The Lion King for the first time, it was about 15 years ago. I was very young, and the death of Mufasa made me cry. And this year, I went to the cinema to watch The Lion King 3D. I had thought I would not cry this time, but i was wrong. I cried again in the same scene. It is still an awesome animation. through watching it, i felt this movie is actually based on Hamlet, which is kind of orthodox now. The basic story lines of the two are pretty much similar. Simba and Hamlet went through their fathers' death whose responsibility is on their uncles, and they try to fight against the evil uncles. Dead fathers' shapes make them feel guilty by keeping saying ""remember."" Still, the two works are different at the same time. Simba overcame all the problems and revenged his father. The Lion King ended happily ever after, unlike Hamlet. The differences are from the existence of Timon and Pumbaa, no doubt. The tragic question ""To be, or not to be"" gets replaced with ""Hakuna Matata,"" and the fact makes the wholly different endings. The two amazing and priceless friends are truly huge parts of the movie.This time when i watched it, I felt sorry for Scar a little bit. When i was young, Scar was an absolute villain to me, but i think Scar could be a pathetic thing which desperately desired to be a king. (anyway he definitely did wrong things) maybe I grew too much. Just as Spring comes after Winter, as Simba has his son, i hope the pure days come to me again."	7
 Pure Disney magic	Disney pull off another magical film with The Lion King. From great characters to superb music this film has it all. Despite telling a simple story Disney capture all the features and elements that make their films so beloved and loved. The voice cast is right on the money and the sentiment that can often cloud this type of film is subtle and emotional. If ever there was a Disney film that perfectly captured the spirit of pure family entertainment it was this one.This film was a huge success for Disney and catapulted them back to the top of their game which judging by this film is exactly where they deserve to be.	7
 A Fun Movie That Everyone Should See	'The Lion King' is one of Disney's most famous and well-praised movies, and there is definitely a reason. This is a beautifully animated classic, with fun and interesting characters, a great soundtrack ('Circle of Life' easily overshadowing the other tracks), and a wonderful story.This movie tells the story of Simba, a lion cub, who will one day become king of the Pride Lands. However, his uncle, Scar, is desperate for the crown himself, and will do anything to get to the top.I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, especially fans of animated movies and Disney.8/10	8
 One of the best Disney films ever?	I don't know why this movie is so underrated. I mean, we're talking about one of the best films in the history of animated films! The plot: superb!! This picture combines in a perfect harmony action, adventure, comedy, drama and all the elements of an enjoyable film for the whole family. If you watch this film, your life changes forever! This is a complete Disney masterpiece. You have to watch this film if you want to know how to live. This picture should be in the top 5 of the best animated films of all times. The creators of this film are really complete geniuses. In conclusion, I can describe this movie with 3 words: I love it! My rating: 10 out of 10!! Hakuna Matata to all of you.	10
 Disney's Best of the last 25 years	"This is defiantly one of the best animated movies that have been released in the last 25 years. This movie features some of the best classic style animation of any movie ever. Great voice work, great music; and on top of all that, it has one of the most heartfelt stories ever told with ink and paint. This one is a little more grim than the two previous Disney classics (little mermaid & Beauty & the Beast) but in the end it works wonders with your emotions. I was 15 when this came out, saw it in theaters, it wasn't too ""kiddy"" for me; one to watch whether your 5 or 50.Just a warning for younger kids, it has one the saddest scenes since Bambi's mother died. Might make sensitive kids cry."	10
 Truly the BEST and most intelligent and entertaining movie ever!!!!!	"*may contain spoilers*I first saw this movie in theatre when I was 4 with my parents. Even when I was little I absolutely loved it, because it was so entertaining. This movie has everything. Extremely detailed and breath-taking visuals. A complex and twisting plot. Wonderful and catchy music. Characters you'll fall in love with. And morals that make you realize so many things about our world. I also love how this movie has so many relations to Shakepeare's Hamlet and even a scene that reminds you of Hitler. I cry every time I see Simba tying to wake his murdered father, Mufasa. Hate boils up inside of me every time I see Scar using his deceptions. I laugh every time I see Pumba and Timon or Ed the hyena's face (Seriously, just looking at Ed makes me burst out laughing). Simba and Nala's cubhood adventures and friendship-turned-into-romance were great. The Circle of Life is probably the best lesson I've learned in my life. I also love the songs like ""Can you feel the love tonight"" and ""Oh I just can't wait to be king"". It is truly the BEST and most intelligent and entertaining movie ever. As you can probably guess, I'm giving this movie a 10 out of 10."	10
 excellent	I absolutely love the lion king, i think it's the king of all animal disney movies, a lot of people enjoyed this movie and it was a great movie for the creators to make. This movie was made in 1994, there were a few singers who i can think of who ttok part in making a song for the movie to put it to the sound track collection: Tina Turner, Elton John. I was only 7 years old when this movie came out, i give this movie 10 out of 10 because i think it's a brillaint, and one of the best disney movies i have ever seen in my childhood life. If you did like the lion king, then i hope you did like the other 2 movies, the lion king 2: simba's pride (1998) and the lion king 1, 1/2: Hakuna Matahta.	10
 Lion King praise: No spoilers	Don't listen to any bad comments, this film is MAGIC.PURE MAGIC. This is the best film ever! The portrayal of Africa is fantastic,the art is incredibly good. The plot is simple yet effective with good morals (Watch the film to find them out, I know you'll enjoy it.)But best of all is the music. The music is INCREDIBLE. Never in my life have I found a film with such amazing music. The film is so incredible, It's an epic (but I don't't think that word is good enough to describe it) It is so fantabulous(lol i made up that word), ill never grow tired of watching it. I have never met a person who hates or even dislikes The Lion King. It is well worth watching. The Lion King is the best film ever!!!!!	10
 A brilliant, magical movie.		10
 One of the best animated films ever in a motion picture!!	"The Lion King is one of the most extremely and phenomenal animated movies I have ever seen on a motion picture. The voices were fitted perfectly for the film especially Mufasa, Timon, and Pumbaa. The music like the opening scene, ""Akunamatata,"" and ""The Circle of Life"" were excellent. All the songs in Lion King and Beauty and the Beast beat any other movies with songs in them. The humor was great and well-done. Everytime I see Pumbaa talk, I always laugh. He had great jokes and same with Rafiki's jokes. The Lion King, as I said once before, is one of the best animated films. Everyone should see it!!10/10"	10

 1 WORD: GREATASTIC (my word for GREAT and FANTASTIC)	THIS MOVIE is one of the best movies I watched from the Disney Studios! I am 14 now and still watchin it it is again GREATATSIC. I think animation is the right thing for me I got the idea from this movie. The music, the comedy, the drama and the action all make this movie GREATASTIC !! The is unique and is made unique because of what it is made up of! I loved it! IT MADE ME WEAP WITH HAPPINESS (sarcasm)!!! THIS movie I think is now a classic. And it is the best out of DISNEY's over 569 movies! I JUST WANT TO SAY I LOVE IT ! THIS MOVIE IS JUST GREAT! I also think that this movie should have an anniversary premiere! It is just the best!This movie is enjoyed around the world and especially in my family! This is a real family movie.	10
 A beautiful and enchanting film.	Even after ten years, this film still holds the magic and charm that it had always left. The Lion King is a story of a young lion cub (Simba) who was tricked into leaving his home believing that he had murdered his own father (King Mufasa) by his uncle (Scar). He grows up running away from his own past, but he eventually returns to his home with his new friends (Timon and Pumbaa) to confront his fear and to take back his rightful place as king in the never-ending circle of life.The one thing I especially liked about this film, aside from the story, is the music. The music is quite endearing and at some points, a real tear-jerker. The Lion King is a truly excellent film that continues to inspire generation-upon-generation.	10
 Masterpiece.	This is truly a masterpiece cartoon from every aspect, from the animation, story, details, characters, etc. Just reading some comments which claim Disney glorify the idea of white vs black in the cartoon, not only as good vs evil but as a racist promoting cartoon is just laughable! Not only does this cartoon has nothing remotely racist, it is not even a good vs evil cartoon. There is no cliche Star Wars like white vs black shallow conflicts. This cartoon is so much more than that, its about family, loyalty, friendship, respect, love and claiming your true position as king. As vague as it sounds, it really motivates you to be better and to overcome any obstacle. I would recommend this cartoon to anyone of all ages, and it is a favorite in this family.10/10	10
 An All-time Favorite	"Every time I watch this classic, I still cry, and I'm 20 years old!  I think the best part of the movie is the ingenious symbolism used.  Now that I am older, I see the more subtle symbolism that gives the movie that ""excellent movie"" quality.  In addition, the soundtrack couldn't have been done better! I have voted a perfect 10!"	10
 Best Animated Film Ever Made	"Through the clouded haze of countless animated feature films since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs made its debut, only one film comes to my mind as being the greatest-- ""The Lion King."" Its revolutionary animation, often-hilarious dialogue, and wonderful cast are only a few things that make this film the greatest animated film ever. None can compare to ""The Lion King""-- it is simply spectacular."	10
 Excellent with a capital E	I thought that this movie was awesome. For an animated movie, it goes beyond being entertaining to kids only. Plus it had stunning animation and I love Lebo M's african music. Almost all of the landscapes/backgrounds were amazingly realistic and the story was great too. This movie is definitely one of my favorites. 1 1/2 should be good when it comes out, too. I loved this movie!	10
 Just some thoughts on Scar (possible spoilers)	"This is probably why J.R.R. Tolkien was so against the use of allusions: has anybody noticed paradox of making Scar--through a song and dance routine, no less!--a Hitler-figure?  If he were really akin to Hitler, wouldn't he be creating a scapegoat race--or in this case, a scapegoat species--and run around killing all of them (or more likely having them killed) for the sake of the purity of the species?  Instead, he makes an agreement with the hyenas--who are hated by everybody in the pure Prideland--and actually honors his promise to them until the tide finally turns so far against him that he has no other way to survive than to finally make them the scapegoat. Also, Hitler was a great propagandist (I mean that in the most derogatory way possible), and I'm sure he built up the hatred against the Jews/gays/blacks/gypsies/etc. for a number of years before the genocides actually started.  As a propogandist, Scar makes a lousy Hitler (again, spoken sarcastically): he brings in the SS hyenas immediately, as if he expected them to suspect his murder of Mufasa and retaliate against him; instead (though in the script they don't) everyone should have suspected him, as his little speech and the sudden appearance of the hyenas could only have been planned well ahead of Mufasa's death (*smack*smack*smack* quick round of knocking the lions' heads together for their stupidity).  Someone as slick as Scar is supposed to have been should have known better than that; it is only the sheer dumbness of the lions and their supposed fear of the pitiful little hyenas that allows his assassination/coup to come off without a hitch. Going along with that, Scar is portrayed as being far too obviously evil, so much so that it's hard to believe nobody but Mufasa and Simba though that he was power-hungry and back-stabbing before he murdered Mufasa (though if Mufasa didn't realize it during the confrontation scene after Simba's ceremony, then somebody needs to have smacked him upside the head and yelled, ""Duh!"").  I suppose you could call that a gaping plot hole (or at least a major lack of good judgment of character) that Mufasa would expect for his brother to help him.  Obviously, Scar is meant to be a Shakespearean-type villain, like Ursula and Jafaar before him, but he is really too lacking.  NEWS FLASH TO DISNEY: Yes, Shakespeare's villains are obvious to the audience, but that's because there were scenes where their deceptions are revealed only to the audience, not to the characters being deceived!At least Ursula made her snide comments under her breath in asides.Besides Scar, a great movie.  Look for his amusing cameo in Hercules--a fate worthy of Hitler."	7
 A Beloved Classic		10
 The Lion King, Disney's most wondrous creation	"The Lion King is Disney's greatest triumph, a movie that reigns supreme in my mind as the greatest animated film ever created.  The superb voice over acting, the majestic footage of the Serengeti deep in Africa, the timeless songs, and the raw emotions depicted in this movie surpass those of all other films in the same genre.  This truly was a landmark in animated films. I can still remember the first time I saw this movie in the theater when I was 8 years old.  I carried a stick around trying to immitate Rafiki and sang ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"" for the entire summer and more.  I will be first in line when the Broadway musical hits Boston, and will undoubtedly enjoy Disney's classic from yet another perspective."	10
" Much Better Than What They Called ""The Original"""		10
 the best of the disney movies ever	I have seen the lion king over 100 times already since i bought the dvd back in the 90's. This has to be the monsterous of the Disney films since it has great drama, a badass villain, great music and heart. I love all of the characters, including Scar since he is ruthless and doesn't have a heart. The song Be Prepared has been in my head whenever i hear it. I give it a 10.	10
 Likeable, but clearly overrated...		
 Superb	Everyone will agree that this movie touches the hearts of young and old. Children will want to watch this movie time and time again with their friends and family.I hope that those of you who haven't had a chance to see this movie will take the opportunity to do so. Enjoy!!!	10
 Disney's Greatest	The Lion King is hands down Disney's greatest movie. While it entertains us with its comedy and humor through characters such as Timon and Pumba it still shows us the serious lessons in life. It has a great story about overcoming the past and rising to be who you really can be. It's a great movie for ALL ages:-)	10
 I liked this movie...for the first minute		
 Not as Good as Everyone Says.	When I first watched the Lion King back 8 years ago, I thought it was a pretty good movie, but not as good as everyone gives it credit for. Sure, it has a lot of action for a kids movie, and an excellent score from Elton John (this is coming from a Billy Joel fan), and even some comic relief in the form of Timon, among others. As far as the plot goes, it isnt really a very exciting plot for anyone over the age of 20, but kids will really enjoy the movie. The voiceovers were well done, especially the always dependable Matt Broderick, James Earl Jones, and Jeremy Irons.This is a very good movie, isnt the best animated movie ever, but the kids will like it.7/10	
 So many words:Fantastic,Wonderful and Terrific.	This movie is truly a classic and it's going to stay like that forever.The first time I say this movie I was completly amazed how great something can be.Every character is great in this movie.I have seen this movie so many times,that I love it more every time I see it.This movie is in my Top 10 favorite movies of all-time.This and Aladdin are the two greatest animation movies ever.Can't wait for the DVD.This movie is going to be remember forever by People around the world.A Masterpiece.A perfect 10/10 and (A+).	10
 I'm Supposed To Hate Disney Movies...	...but not this one.  The Lion King is Disney at its family-oriented BEST! This is one of its few films in recent decades that belongs with its classics!  The animation is great, the voice-acting superb, and the characters...well, quite animated!  Don't just rent this one, it's a keeper.	7
 This isn't a message board, but...	dp10:I think when you made the comment about the TLK-Hamlet similarity, you were referring to my previous comment. I think you should know that I was not objecting to the fact that TLK adapted Hamlet, I was objecting to the fact that Disney did not properly recognize Shakespeare for giving them an adaptation (the same goes for Kimba the White Lion). They could adapt all they want, but cite it, or else its plagiarism...sucks doesn't it? If you plagiarize in college, you get expelled and earn a scar on your permanent record, but Disney did it with this and got nothing but praise...so anyways, that was my real complaint.	5
 IT'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL MOVIE	I think that it is one of the greatest Disney's movies af all time. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the best of all, I think.I enjoyed the music, all the songs and most of the characters, specially Timon and the hyenas.The only thing I didn't like in this movie is the spiritism it carries in some scenes (like Simba talking to his dead father )But in spite of all, it's a great movie.	9
 Hilarious!	My teacher and his preschooler watched this film everyday for four weeks. Well Simba is born and it makes Scar upset. Well Scar and his 3 pet hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, And Ed kill Mufassa. If Simba is to defeat all 4 of them he must take his place in the circle of life. Zazu Scar's companion does whatever Scar orders him to do. Well Nala comes to warn him that Scar let the hyenas take over the kingdom.	
 Yet another American film with a 'borrowed' story.	Boring film, based on a classic Japanese manga/animation series from the 60s: Osamu Tezuka's 'Kimba, the White Lion' which was broadcasted in the USA in the 60s and 70s. Of course the Disney guys tried to deny the totally obvious similarities, but you just have to take a look at the original... Ignore this crap and watch the original.	
" ""Slimy, yet satisfying."""		7
 An all time Disney classic	Disney's The Lion King is one of those movies that is just perfect. The film's story is absolutely amazing.But the story was amazing then the soundtrack, music and voice acting are outstanding!! With an all star cast, consisting of some of Hollywood's best such as Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Rowan Atkinson, Disney has definitely hired the best.However it is the soundtrack and music that takes the cake. Produced by Tim Rice and Elton John, the soundtrack is the best I've heard in a Disney film.For those of you who have missed the opportunity to see on the big screen, get it on video NOW!! because The Lion King is truly Disney's best and that says a lot.	10
 Good Comments	The Lion King is a very good film for adults or children. It features an excellent storyline and a brilliant musical soundtrack. The characters are well thought out and the animation is amazing. Well worth buying. Definately ten out of ten!	10
 Greatest Disney film ever. They should have quit after this one.	"Anyone who doesn't love this movie has no heart and must be dead inside. Maybe they didn't get to see this one on the big screen and only saw the video version.  ""Lion King"" had me mesmerized from the opening, with the sun coming up over the savanna.  I saw this the day it opened and in the theater, at the end, people stood up and cheered!!  This movie deserves theatrical re-release.  Disney,  ARE YOU LISTENING???  Do yourselves a favor and put this back where it belongs, on the big screen."	10
 Why is this the most popular Disney movie?	It seems like the public is saying that this is the best Disney can do or has ever done. Why? Because this movie is more appealing to adults than it is to kids. In my opinion The Lion King really isn't all that great. Why? hears why. The story stinks, a lot of the dailogue is stupid (especially with Timon and Pumbaa), and its just not fun to watch. To be totally honest, I think that Aladdin should be the most popular Disney movie. Aladdin is the only Disney movie in which I can't find anything to grip about. The Lion King does, however, have SOME things going for it, like great art quality, good characters and okay music, But this movie really doesn't deserve to be the most popular Disney movie. I give this movie a 7 out of 10.	
 Great movie. Sort of.	Ok, I need to get something off my chest. This was a really good movie. However, it isn't THE best Disney movie. That award goes to Toy Story. All in all, it's worth buying but if you want the best movie out there, you might want to buy another movie. The animation is really great though. Watch the willdebeest running while Simba runs as fast as he can. If you have surround sound, it will sound like you have animals running through your living room. I guess what I find to be weak parts to this movie is the fact that it couldn't have a better script than Toy Story or Hercules. Where's the comedy??? All the voices are done pretty good and Jeremy Irons was really good as the menacing villian. It's good if you have nothing better to do on a sunny or rainy afternoon.	10
